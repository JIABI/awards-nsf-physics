This workshop will bring together leading experts and early career researchers from mathematics, statistics, computer science, machine learning, data sciences, and life sciences to report on cutting-edge and state-of-the-art computational algorithms in scientific computing and to identify computational and statistical challenges and open problems in machine learning and the life sciences. In addition, the workshop will provide a forum for an international and diverse group of researchers to foster communication, to facilitate new collaborative interactions, and to initiate joint research projects that will address the open and emerging issues and the computational and statistical challenges posed in machine learning and the life sciences. The three-day workshop will consist of presentations, posters, and group discussions that will stimulate an intensive exchange of ideas and foster fruitful interactions. This award supports the attendance of both researchers and graduate students, with priority given to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, early career investigators, members of under-represented groups, and researchers who do not have other federal support. <br/><br/>Scientific computing is an increasingly important tool in many areas of science and engineering, such as biomedical imaging, genomics, proteomics, phylogeny, computer vision, and precision medicine, allowing biological data and systems to be explored that are not amenable to theoretical or experimental investigations. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The advent of the big data era pushed machine learning to the forefront and has spurred broad interests in machine learning in recent years. The field of life sciences has advanced through a synergistic interplay between deep understanding of biology and mathematical techniques, especially from computational mathematics, probability, and statistics. Still, biologists are overwhelmed by the amount of data being generated and the new methods required for data-management. Quantitative theories are needed to help interpret and to contextualize observations. A variety of new challenges in scientific computing for machine learning have emerged in recent years that are related to the life sciences, such as developing predictive models for disorder detection, drug repurposing, toxicity prediction, electronic health record analysis, language translation, etc. These issues and many other open problems will be discussed among the diverse group of scientists participating in the workshop.

New electrocatalysts are needed to solve this challenge. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are only one or a few atoms thick and as such, they serve as desirable, high surface area electrocatalysts for energy conversions. In this project, Dr. Yuanyue Liu is using computer simulations to provide a fundamental understanding of the capabilities of 2D materials as electrocatalysts. His simulations use artificial intelligence to accelerate the discovery process. Dr. Liu is training students in computational chemistry, catalysis and energy conversions by actively engaging them in multidisciplinary research and integrating his research findings into the classroom. Dr. Liu is working with the Faculty Technology Studio to create educational videos that illustrate electrocatalysis applications. These videos are being used in various outreach programs to increase the interest of K-12 students and underrepresented groups in pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Yuanyue Liu at the University of Texas at Austin is developing an improved understanding of the electrocatalytic mechanisms of 2D materials (an emerging class of electrocatalysts).  By performing grand-canonical density functional theory (gc-DFT) calculations and coupling the calculations with machine learning, the team searches for new 2D electrocatalysts with better performance.  Conventional DFT calculations often neglect the effects of varying charge and constant potential in electrochemical reactions, yet these parameters are found to be critical for 2D materials. The gc-DFT includes these effects and thus can elucidate the mechanisms of 2D electrocatalysts for reactions such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction/evolution, and carbon dioxide reduction. Machine learning models are used to uncover the underlying factors that govern the catalytic activity and selectivity.  The models also predict better catalysts from the large 2D materials library.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Clementi and her group are developing machine learning tools to combine the results from microscopic simulation and experimental data into a data-driven modeling framework. The last several years have seen an immense increase in high-throughput and high-resolution technologies for experimental observation.  These advances are combined with high-performance techniques to simulate molecular systems at a microscopic level resulting in vast and ever-increasing amounts of data. Professor Clementi is taking advantage of this abundance of data and uses machine learning to extract information, in order to formulate general principles regulating the behavior of molecular systems. Understanding chemical processes at the molecular level is essential for a large number of applications, from energy storage to drug design. Additionally, as the need to represent massive data sets in terms of a model bears similarity across different fields, Professor Clementi's work may have an impact on a broad range of completely different disciplines from genomics to finance. This research impacts an interdisciplinary community of students and researchers. Her project includes the development of undergraduate and graduate courses, and outreach activities focused in the recruiting and mentoring of minority students, especially through collaboration with the Tapia Center at Rice University.<br/><br/>Professor Clementi is developing a data-driven framework to design effective molecular models at multiple resolutions, to address questions currently out of reach to existing computational and experimental approaches. The main idea is to use state-of-the-art machine learning methods to ""learn"" the coarse-grained dynamical models governing molecular systems (structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics/mechanism) at the mesoscale, by combining simulation data generated from microscopic simulation, and experimental data. By integrating different sources of data, this modeling approach reconciles bottom-up and top-down methods. This approach generates functional building blocks that can be embedded in higher-order simulations in order to bridge the gap to macroscopic systems. This modeling framework may serve as a keystone to integrate vast amounts of chemical data into quantitative, mechanistic and comprehensible models. Such models may explain how different molecular components organize and interact as a function of time and space in performing functions at the macroscopic scale. In particular, the developed framework is applied to investigate one specific biomolecular process: the binding of peptides to Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite these impressive successes, it is not clear why neural nets work so well. In this project, the PI will use tools from probability to develop our theoretical understanding of neural networks. The goal is to give us a deep understanding of why neural nets are so efficient at overcoming challenges in optimization and high-dimensional data analysis. These theoretical insights will, in turn, inform the intuition of engineers for building the next generation of neural net-based machine learning systems. <br/><br/>Mathematically, the study of neural networks is a cross between approximation theory and optimization, touching on topics from random matrix theory, Gaussian processes, hyperplane arrangements, tensor decompositions, and optimal transport, to name a few. The PI will focus specifically on (i) the stability of gradient-based optimization of neural networks to both the linear statistics and spectral asymptotics of random matrix ensembles given by products of many random matrices in the regime where both the number of terms in the product and the sizes of the matrices simultaneously group, and (ii) computing the correlation functions of neural networks at initialization (e.g. with random weights and biases).

For example, weather prediction or climate modeling is based on geophysical data collected at scattered sites, by sensors on satellites, ground stations, or stations at sea.  Carrying out such tasks presents difficulties for traditional methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed sites or which require constructing ""meshes"" (think wire fence) that must be carefully tailored to deal with the data sites involved.  Newer methods, the so-called kernel methods, are meshfree and can handle scattered data.  The investigators further develop the theory of kernel methods, on the basis of which algorithms can be developed that are easier to use, faster, less expensive to implement, and capable of handling data from a hundred thousand or more sites.<br/><br/>Scattered data problems present a challenge for any method, including the traditional kernel-type algorithms based on translates of one (conditionally) positive definite function.  Scattered data occur naturally in meshfree methods, machine learning, neural nets, and other situations.  Dealing with such data, ideally, requires local, stable bases, preconditioners, and other similar tools.  In recent work on the sphere and rotations in space where no boundary is present, the investigators have developed novel bases related to certain classes of kernels.  For problems where boundaries are inherent, their bases need further development.  One key part of this project involves a novel idea of extrapolating data slightly beyond the boundary of a compact domain to enhance the approximation power of the method.  Another key area of investigation involves local approximation orders for data that is far more general than the typical quasi-uniform assumptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It drives many processes in the universe that are crucial for our existence. One particularly important aspect of the strong nuclear force is the existence of quark gluon plasma. If ordinary matter is heated up to temperatures of about 1,000,000,000,000 degrees, hotter than the core of the sun, atoms and molecules cease to exist and even protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei melt. The remaining primordial soup of quarks and gluons filled the very early universe. We can recreate quark gluon plasma in our largest particle colliders by smashing heavy nuclei into each other. Experimental programs at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the USA study the properties of quark gluon plasma. This project will support research that will improve our understanding of the formation and properties of quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions. The PI and his collaborators will use computer simulations and advanced statistical methods to reach this goal. Funding is provided to support training for a graduate students and junior scientists in nuclear science.<br/><br/>Quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions emerges from the highly complex gluon fields that are initially created in nuclear collisions. The PI and his group will investigate these fields and their properties by studying how angular momentum of the droplets of quark gluon plasma is related to the initial angular momentum of the colliding nuclei. The same gluon fields will also be studied through their interaction with fast quarks. The PI and his group will be able to use the JETSCAPE framework for large scale computational simulations of nuclear collisions. They will study various aspects of jets and heavy quarks being quenched in quark gluon plasma. They will then extract properties of quark gluon plasma using multiple constraints. For example,  the strength of quenching of quarks and heavy quarks, and the viscosity of quark gluon plasma can be independently measured and are mutually related. Testing these relations will be an important step towards a deeper understanding of the dynamics of quark gluon plasma. The PI and his group will also use advanced statistical methods and machine learning applied to data to understand the mechanisms of hadron formation from quarks and gluons. These results will be used to improve the state-of-the-art modeling of the hadronization process that is a crucial input to many calculations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the stars form, they add energy back into their environment ('feedback') and influence the birth gas cloud. This feedback appears as fast-moving gas, which sometimes looks like large bubbles. The data are complex, so identifying feedback is difficult. Typically, astronomers have found the feedback ""by eye"", which is subjective and time-consuming. A new field of computer science, machine learning, provides an alternative approach to find feedback. In machine learning, computer algorithms are trained to identify features in the same way the human brain recognizes objects - like cats, dogs and cars.  The investigator's group will use state-of-the-art models of forming stars to train machine learning algorithms to find feedback. They will apply the algorithms to telescope observations and compare with the feedback sources previously found by humans. <br/><br/>The investigator will share the models with the public through the Milky Way project, which is an online astronomy program that trains people to identify feedback in telescope images of gas clouds. The program will also train students in research techniques, including undergraduates from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The proposal addresses a fundamental star formation question:  How much mass and energy is associated with stellar feedback in the interstellar medium?  To answer this question, the PI and collaborators will use magnetohydrodynamic simulations of forming stars, for which full feedback information is known, to train machine learning algorithms to identify and quantify feedback. Dust and molecular line 'synthetic observations' will be produced and used together with observational data as a training set.  The investigators will compare the machine learning identifications to prior visually identified feedback catalogs, including those from the citizen-science Milky Way Project, create an updated census, and publicly release the algorithm and data to the community.

Gaussian processes are used in many application areas, such as geospatial analysis, machine learning, and the analysis of computer experiments. Gaussian processes are flexible, interpretable, and provide natural quantification of uncertainty. However, direct application of Gaussian processes is too computationally expensive for large datasets. This project addresses the computational challenges with novel algorithms and bridges the gap between statistical and machine learning approaches. As big data now appear in almost every field of science and society, providing powerful, scalable, and free software to analyze such datasets can have a transformative effect. This work will replace current practices and approximations for massive spatial data that are often simplistic due to computational limitations. This project can lead to improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification in countless applications with direct impact on society, including carbon monitoring, renewable energy, rainfall prediction, calibration of robotic arms, and modeling and prediction of insurgent activities. The developed methods and software will thus be an important tool for computational and data-enabled science and engineering. The investigators will mentor and train student researchers, and share the project findings via journal publications and conference presentations.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a nearly universal toolbox for scalable Gaussian process (GP) modeling. The toolbox is based on the ordered conditional approximation (OCA), a simple but very powerful idea that exploits the screening effect (i.e., conditional independence) exhibited by many popular covariance functions. The OCA framework unifies many state-of-the-art GP approximations from statistics, machine learning, and numerical linear algebra. This project will result in new, highly accurate OCA methods with guaranteed scalability and broad applicability for modeling and analysis of nonstationary, multivariate, multi-scale, and other processes. Also, extensions will be developed that allow these new spatial-statistics methods to be used in a variety of machine-learning applications, where OCA-type approaches have not received much attention so far. For the new methods, the computational cost is guaranteed to be linear in the data size, with further speed-ups possible through parallelization. All approaches will be implemented in easy-to-use open-source software. This will allow users to bring the power of GPs to bear on modern datasets, enabling spatial prediction, calibration, parameter learning, and nonparametric regression with big data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices are conventionally based on blue- (450 nm) or UV- (370-410 nm) emitting light emitting diodes (LEDs) that are coated with a rare-earth substituted inorganic phosphor encapsulated in an optically transparent polymer. In combination, these emissive lights produce a functional and efficient white light. Unfortunately, the availability and variety of inorganic phosphors that are necessary to efficiently convert the LED emission and create white light are limited, which increases the upfront cost of pc-LEDs and inhibits their widespread adoption. The known phosphors are also often thermally insulating oxides or nitrides, which lead to extreme operating temperatures (above 150 Celsius) under LED excitation that can degrade phosphor performance. Consequently, the next generation of pc-LEDs requires the development of new, efficient inorganic phosphors with enhanced thermal properties to reduce their cost and encourage the replacement of traditional light bulbs. This NSF CAREER award project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, establishes a research approach that connects machine learning, computation, and materials synthesis to target new inorganic phosphors with improved thermal response allowing them to operate in extreme environments.

In the US alone, lighting accounts for 22% of total electrical energy use, which translates to $50 billion per year spent on lighting, accompanied with 130 million tons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere from fossil fuel plants. Solid state white lighting, which uses a blue-emitting light emitting diode (LEDs) coated with a luminescent powder called a phosphor, has emerged as highly efficient, long-lasting light source capable of replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting. New LEDs that emit ultraviolet light have recently been recognized as chips that could yield an even better light source. However, to make use of this technology, it is necessary to discover new, efficient phosphor systems that can convert the ultraviolet LED light into white light. This CAREER award's research and education program support Prof. Jakoah Brgoch at the University of Houston to establish new computational and machine-learning techniques that are capable of increasing the rate at which new phosphors can be identified. This information can then be used to direct the Brgoch group's synthesis towards the most promising phosphor systems, whose properties can be analyzed using computational methods to understand the enhanced optical response. This cooperative research approach not only leads to higher performance materials, but it also has the potential to transform the lighting industry by identifying new and improved materials.

In the machine learning paradigm, one typically observes a collection of data that represents the measurements of a physical process. The data may be represented in terms of a large number of variables. To learn the physical structures inherent to the data, one looks for a small number of latent variables that describe a low-dimensional manifold which contains or ""passes close to"" the data points. Whereas classical statistical regression looks for a linear relationship in the data, manifold learning allows for possibly non-linear descriptions. The principal investigator plans to develop practical manifold learning algorithms using techniques from extension theory. Consider for instance the problem of interpolating a set of data by a smooth, convex hypersurface. Whereas all currently available solutions to this problem require that the data points be sampled uniformly from the entire surface, the principal investigator proposes an approach which would work even when there are no sampled data on large pieces of the surface. The proposed research will introduce new connections between the fields of harmonic analysis and machine learning.<br/><br/>The past few decades have witnessed the development of abstract notions of differentiation and curvature on nonsmooth spaces. To study singular solutions to mean curvature flow, for instance, it is important to develop a generalized notion of curvature. Another achievement has been Cheeger's theory of differentiation on metric measure spaces. Cheeger's spaces carry a notion of distance and volume, but surprisingly, they lack the structure of local coordinate charts usually required to define a differential calculus. One shortcoming of this approach is its inherent limitation to first order theories. That is, one can define a first order differential operator, but the notion of a second order operator, such as the Laplacian or heat operator, is meaningless at this level of abstraction. The principal investigator proposes an alternate perspective: Assume the space is embedded as a subset of a Euclidean space. One can take the differential calculus on the Euclidean space and push it forward to define a calculus on the subset. This simple technique allows one to define high-order tangent and cotangent bundles on subsets of Euclidean space. An issue with the approach is that the computation of the bundles is highly nontrivial. The first order tangent bundle can be defined by a standard blow-up argument, but the higher order ""paratangent bundles"" are difficult to understand. By focusing on a class of explicit examples of algebraic varieties with cuspidal singularities, the principal investigator will find new methods for computing with these abstract spaces. The principal investigator will develop a notion of divided difference quotients on algebraic and semialgebraic sets."

However, the presence of multiple constraints can complicate the process of statistical learning. This project aims to develop novel statistical methods to help solve real world problems where a multitude of complex constraints pose inferential challenges. Motivations are drawn directly from three concrete applications: i) extracting the radius of proton from electric form-factor data, a fundamental problem in atomic physics which is of high relevance due to anomalies between results from different modes of experimentation, ii) describing the relationship between wind velocity and power derived from wind-turbines, which is one of the fastest growing renewable sources of energy and iii) describing the traffic flow pattern with traffic speed, a key object of research in traffic engineering. The project will bring together ideas from machine learning and Bayesian nonparametrics to develop statistically sound and computationally efficient methods of inference in constrained decision problems. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The project aims to develop a principled probabilistic approach towards inference in scientific and engineering applications where various physical constraints provide a priori knowledge regarding key objects of inference. Such objects may correspond to a single curve or a collection of curves or density functions. The PI and co-PI will develop novel statistical methods for simultaneous incorporation of multiple shape constraints motivated by real scientific and engineering applications, while being broadly generalizable beyond the considered applications. Emphasis is laid on obtaining equivalent representations of various constraints within a flexible nonparametric Bayesian model, and developing novel prior distributions on these constrained spaces. The Bayesian approach is attractive to obtain uncertainty estimates, and the PI and co-PI aim to develop rigorous theoretical guarantees for the frequentist validity of Bayesian uncertainty measures in the present setting. In addition, the PI and co-PI propose to demonstrate that including the constraints diminishes the uncertainty which will subsequently lead to better scientific conclusions. The methodological developments will be accompanied by efficient computation algorithms that meet the scalability demanded by the specific applications and beyond.

The main insight from this theory is that a compressible signal can be acquired with much less effort than a signal with a high information content. However, these results are commonly based on mathematical models for signals that are already digitized and for sensors that measure randomly, which makes them somewhat disconnected from realistic physical signals and apparatuses. This work explores recent trends in narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Instead of digital signals, models for analog signals are used to define compressibility. The signal space includes the possibility of continuous changes without producing artifacts in the signal recovery procedure. This idea will be applied to radar, X-ray crystallography, and other sensing systems. The work is also anticipated to have application to neural networks that form the basis for modern machine learning algorithms. Although the application to machine learning is entirely concerned with digital data, the use of continuous models ensures that encoded information can be retrieved accurately. <br/><br/>Redundant, stable expansions with frames have become central to many applications of mathematics in data science, signal acquisition, and communications, from remote sensing to packet-based, wireless, fiber optical, or quantum communications and recently in compressed sensing and super-resolution. Despite the successes of the frame-based expansion and acquisition of signals, there is often a mismatch between the stylized mathematical signal and measurement models that are assumed and the corresponding physical models in the analog domain. For example, signal acquisition is typically described by specific linear functionals, not randomly chosen, unstructured ones. This research project addresses the need to improve compatibility between continuous and discrete representation spaces on a fundamental level. A typical model for analog signals is given by infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with a reproducing kernel and an associated expansion with respect to a continuous, highly coherent family of vectors. A natural measure of sparsity of a signal is in this setting the minimal number of kernel functions needed in its expansion. Signal acquisition is usually based on sampling from a group-invariant, discrete family of functionals. The expected outcomes of the project include: (1) accurate recovery for signals that are sparsely synthesized in a finite- or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel space and measured with physically relevant sensing models, using a sparsity-inducing norm that is stable with respect to continuous deformations; (2) phase retrieval, signal recovery based on magnitudes of frame coefficients, in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces such as multivariate Paley-Wiener spaces, which will be done using sparsity to demonstrate injectivity of measurements, stability, and feasibility of recovery algorithms in a general class of kernel spaces; and (3) a version of Mallat's scattering transform in a redundant representation with approximate invertibility based on phase retrieval and sparsity. The scattering transform extracts nonlinear features from data that are powerful descriptors in classification problems. It is designed from a viewpoint of desirable properties in the analog domain, but its application is mostly to digitized data of limited size, for which the claims need to be properly adapted. The investigators will use phase retrieval and sparsity to demonstrate the approximate invertibility of the transform, which is needed to verify the faithful encoding of data."

By both going beyond the visible spectrum and accurately discriminating wavelengths within the visible range, this technology can be remarkably powerful for distinguishing different materials when standard imagery is ineffective. As a result, hyperspectral remote sensing offers unique capabilities for tasks that include monitoring the development and health of crops, mapping oil spills and invasive species, and detecting objects that may be camouflaged. With modern remote sensing applications not being constrained to satellite images, however, the image acquisition in many scenarios is no longer under controlled conditions, because illumination, physical parameters, and viewing angles may change over time and objects of interest may be partially occluded. This investigation introduces a new generation of mathematical and algorithmic tools that are designed to provide robust classification of hyperspectral data under such realistic conditions. The project aims to develop a new class of analysis and classification algorithms for hyperspectral data that are robust with respect to changes of illumination, viewpoint, and physical conditions.  The results are intended to have direct application to the monitoring of environmental conditions in coastal wetlands and to other observations of societal, economic, and national security interest.<br/><br/>While hyperspectral imaging and image processing have been well developed within the remote-sensing community, image acquisition in remote sensing may occur in conditions where illumination, physical parameters, and viewing angle change over time. This research program combines ideas from sparse representations, multilayer convolutional networks, and machine learning to address the challenges to imaging posed by such changing conditions. A novelty of the approach is the adaptation of methods from sparse representations and shearlets, an anisotropic multiscale system that is particularly effective at capturing the directional content of multidimensional data. This approach provides the basis for constructing a deep learning neural convolutional network tailored to hyperspectral data and designed to generate stable and robust feature vectors. This investigation aims to develop an efficient multiscale representation that is customized to the specifics of hyperspectral data. The scattering transform will be adapted in combination with shearlets by exploiting the covariance properties of shearlets under affine transformations to build stable and viewpoint-invariant features for hyperspectral data. A novel hierarchical scheme for classification optimized for the specific structure of hyperspectral data and sparsity-based inpainting methods to restore hyperspectral data corrupted by occlusions will be developed. These new algorithms will be used for the analysis of hyperspectral data to monitor environmental conditions of coastal wetlands, a challenging case study of great social and economic importance."

In most cases, efficient approximation and study is facilitated by (non-asymptotic) high-dimensional probability. The investigator intends to work on several questions related to the most widely applied principle in high-dimensional probability: the concentration of measure phenomenon. This principle is commonly the main reason behind the frequently-observed tendency of high-dimensional systems to congregate around typical forms.  To quantify this phenomenon, one needs precise inequalities for high-dimensional objects (for instance, measures or random vectors), where independence properties can be lacking.

Numerous practical everyday-life issues, as well as fundamental scientific mysteries, can be expressed in geometric terms. For instance, networks are ubiquitous in our modern society. From the World Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks to economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. They can naturally be seen as geometric objects by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two nodes as a quantity measuring their proximity. The study of physical laws has led as well to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate geometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the symmetries underlying quantum physics. The notion of a metric space is a central concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, and in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine learning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept generalizes the classical notion of an Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is computed as the length of an imaginary straight line connecting them. The heart of the matter usually boils down to understanding whether a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, can be faithfully represented in a more structured space, typically a Banach space with some desirable properties. Our ability to do so usually has tremendous applications.<br/><br/>The problems investigated in this project are motivated by their potential applications in theoretical physics and theoretical computer science. Most of the problems considered find their origins either in practical issues (e.g. the design of efficient approximation algorithms), or in fundamental mathematical problems in topology or noncommutative geometry (e.g. the Novikov conjecture(s), the Baum-Connes conjecture(s)). Embedding problems that arise in connection to these problems have been considered independently by several groups of mathematicians (Banach space geometers, geometric group theorists, computer scientists...). An underlined aspect of this proposal is to consider these embeddings problems from a unified and global standpoint. Fundamental and long-standing open problems in quantitative metric geometry (e.g. Enflo's problem, a metric reformulation of uniform smoothability, the coarse embeddability of groups and expander graphs into super-reflexive Banach spaces...) will be tackled from a different angle with new and innovative techniques. In particular, the project will develop a certain asymptotic theory of Banach spaces and explore its connections to the geometry of infinite graphs. The approach here to solve the local problems above, is to study asymptotic counterparts of the local properties involved, in order to gain new insights and to devise new approaches. This approach is motivated by the fact that the asymptotic setting usually provides a finer picture, is on some occasion better understood, and requires completely different techniques. A general outline of the research methodology of this project is to utilize powerful tools from surrounding fields (graph theory, probability theory, Ramsey theory...), and cross-over techniques (e.g. techniques from theoretical computer science to solve geometric group theoretic problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their widespread use in processes spanning from energy to medicine, the complexity of zeolite synthesis makes it difficult to understand how these materials form and what methods can be developed to control and tailor their properties. This project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, employs a combination of experimental and computational techniques to investigate a topic of growing interest, seed-assisted synthesis, where crystal seeds are introduced into growth solutions to promote the formation of zeolite crystals with desirable size, shape, and composition. Mechanisms of seeding, that is starting a synthesis from a small crystal, are largely unexplored in zeolite synthesis, yet limited studies reveal that these processes are capable of achieving material properties that are otherwise inaccessible by conventional routes. The research group at the University of Houston studies this to improve the fundamental understanding of crystal-to-crystal transformations with the aim of establishing guidelines for rational design. As part of this project, they investigate mechanisms of seed-assisted synthesis, the development of new methods to prepare novel materials, and the use of unique equipment that permit direct visualization of crystal surface growth at a molecular level. The intellectual merit of this project is an improved fundamental knowledge of crystal engineering that enables discovery of new routes to tailor the properties of zeolites, and an improved understanding of complex processes underlying zeolite crystallization. The broader impacts of this project are the advancement of techniques with transformative outcomes for large-scale zeolite production and applications. Considering the large use of zeolites in commercial processes, a significant socioeconomic benefit can be derived from these investigations. Additionally, this award expands a program with NASA and local high schools, coordinated through outreach liaisons at the University of Houston. The principle investigator also offers opportunities for research at all levels (K-12, undergraduate, and graduate) and promotes research and education with an emphasis on increased matriculation and retention of under-represented minority students, at risk students, and women in engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with exceptional hydrothermal stability and tunable acidity for commercial applications ranging from energy to medicine. An emerging approach in zeolite synthesis is the use of crystal seeding or interzeolite transformations where an initial (parent) structure is converted into a product (daughter), yet the mechanisms of seeding in complex, nonclassical pathways of crystallization are largely unexplored. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, researchers aim to advance the fundamental understanding of crystal-to-crystal transformations with the goal of finding empirical rules, guided by machine learning, to predict and control the conversion of a parent zeolite into a product of identical or different crystal structure. Specifically, they study (1) the use of seeds in crystal engineering through the careful selection of parent-daughter combinations to elucidate factors governing nonclassical seeding mechanisms; (2) new protocols to produce self-pillared zeolites via an organic-free, seed-assisted synthesis; and (3) analyzing crystal-crystal transformations using a unique liquid cell for scanning probe microscopy to capture time-resolved images of zeolite surfaces undergoing interzeolite conversion. The intellectual merit of this project is the focus on addressing knowledge gaps in zeolite crystallization where more fundamental studies are required to provide deeper insight into methods capable of selectively controlling nucleation and growth through facile, efficient processes. Controlling the physicochemical properties of zeolites is nontrivial, but can be accomplished through seed-assisted techniques. This research has the potential to establish an improved understanding of intercrystalline transitions to advance understanding of complex zeolite growth pathways and establish design principles for crystal engineering as a foundation for applied studies that extend beyond the scope of this project. The broader impacts of this project are the potential to synthesize zeolites with optimal properties that cannot be achieved by conventional methods.

The goal of the project is to develop a new type of microscope with unprecedented space and time resolution. The Landes group's new microscope allows the study of how rare events impact the efficiency of porous materials that are important for catalysis, separations science, corrosion, and biology. It has been established that it is possible to manipulate light as it interacts with molecules and proteins. For example, Professor Landes has already shown that by shaping light's phase, events faster than the camera frame rate can be imaged. By incorporating new mathematical and physical tools, the current project will result in a new instrument to image and track fast dynamics in porous materials with optimized 3-D space and time resolution. The interdisciplinary nature of this research effort provides participating students with a unique experience at the interface of spectroscopy and materials science, as well as image processing and modern information theory, and continues the strong history of cross-disciplinary activities in science and technology at Rice University. This grant supports Professor Landes to provide training opportunities to high school teachers to incorporate cutting edge science into their course materials, as well as her new effort to create a summer scientific programming course. <br/><br/>Recently, a new microscopy technique called super temporal-resolved microscopy (STREM) was developed. Proof-of-concept measurements showed that STREM can improve the time resolution of traditional wide-field cameras by at least twenty times. This development, if combined with recent advances in 3-D imaging methods and signal processing, represents an opportunity to resolve the multiscale, nonlinear dynamics that drive a range of interfacial materials properties. Thus, the current project's objective is to develop and optimize 4-D STREM, a chemical imaging method for quantifying the nonlinear dynamics and structures in porous materials. It is hypothesized that better 3-D sub-diffraction spatial information, coupled with improved time resolution and signal processing algorithms, reveals heterogeneous mass transport, chemical, and biological mechanisms occurring at porous interfaces. The project will involve innovations in both hardware and software to improve the temporal and 2-D spatial resolution. Additionally, a new algorithm is to be developed to track in 3-D. Finally, the new microscope is to be used to acquire and curate a machine learning library capable of differentiating among common analyte, sample, and instrument conditions. A new instrument optimized for characterizing the multiscalar physics and chemistry that underlie separations in porous media, by improving both spatial and temporal resolution is obtained in this project. Further, the project will result in new algorithms to extract information from large 3-D data sets. In terms of applications, a more detailed description of mass transport in pores and channels is a step towards predictive separations, which are currently optimized empirically, amounting to billions of dollars each year for industry, government, and academic purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In all these computations, the step that tends to be the most time-consuming, and which therefore limits how large problems can be solved, concerns the manipulation of large square or rectangular arrays of numbers, called ""matrices"". Many of the matrices that arise in practical applications have redundancies, and can be compressed to enable them to be stored using less space. Using the compressed format, computations involving the matrix can also be greatly accelerated. The problems that will be addressed are deterministic in nature, but the algorithms that will be developed are probabilistic. It turns out that by exploiting certain mathematical properties of large ensembles of independent random numbers, one can build algorithms for compressing matrices that are much faster than traditional deterministic techniques. The new randomized algorithms can in theory fail, but the likelihood of failure can be shown to  be lower than 1 time out of 10,000,000,000 runs in typical applications. Randomized algorithms of this type have recently attracted much interest due to the fact that they perform  particularly well on emerging computing platforms such as mobile computing (where conserving energy is the key priority), computing using graphical processor units (where the vast numbers of computational cores create challenges), and distributed memory parallel computers. The methods also perform very well when applied  to massively large datasets that must be stored on hard drives, or on large server farms. The project will train one doctoral student, and will lead to the release of a publicly available software package that implements the methods that will be developed. <br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the objective of the project is to develop efficient algorithms for factorizing matrices and for solving large linear systems of algebraic equations. The algorithms will be based on randomized sampling, and will exploit remarkable mathematical properties of random matrices and random orthogonal projections. Such randomized algorithms require less communication  than traditional methods, which makes them particularly attractive for modern applications involving multicore processors, distributed computing, out-of-core computing, etc. Specifically, the project will address the following problems: (1) Computing full matrix factorizations (e.g. the so called ""column pivoted QR factorization"") which are core building blocks in scientific computing. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate speed-ups of close to an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art software packages. (2) Solving linear systems involving many unknowns and many equations. We expect to achieve substantial practical acceleration, and are cautiously optimistic about the possibility to develop solvers with substantially better asymptotic complexity than the cubic complexity achieved by standard techniques. (3) Developing randomized methods for accelerating computational simulations of phenomena such as electro-statics, composite materials, biochemical processes, slow fluid flows, Gaussian processes in 2 and 3 dimensions, etc. Technically, this will be achieved by developing randomized methods for compressing so called ""data-sparse"" or ""rank-structured"" matrices."

In all three examples, the unusual nature of the inference targets as random subsets gives rise to challenging data analysis problems. In contrast, most traditional methods work for inference targets that are a single number, like a treatment effect, a level of differential protein expression, or a mean response.  This project aims to address this gap in currently available methodology by developing and applying new methods to solve several specific inference problems related to random subsets.<br/><br/>This project develops novel statistical inference methods for random subsets to approach such inference problems by explicitly introducing parsimony and interpretability as criteria for the reported inference. Related methods are developed for random partitions, feature allocation, and extensions of such structures. Besides the development of models and inference paradigms, a second major thrust of the proposed work is the development of computationally feasible implementations for large data sets. Model-based Bayesian inference for random subsets quickly leads to prohibitively computation-intensive implementations when simulation-exact posterior Monte Carlo methods are used.

The world around us is described by quantum mechanics, yet quantum mechanical phenomena are absent from our day-to-day life. This anomaly comes from the enormous complexity of the many interacting atoms that make up everyday objects, which wash out quantum effects to give the classical world. By isolating electrons and atoms from this complex environment, experimentalists have made enormous strides towards realizing quantum effects in increasing large and practical devices, which has become known as the second quantum revolution. This revolution will further the need for understanding quantum physics at its most fundamental level, which is the overarching goal of this CAREER award. <br/><br/>The research will focus on a class of systems known as many-body cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which gives access to quantum properties of light and insight into the interaction between light and matter. Quantum mechanics tells us that light comes in individual units called photons, but conventional lasers contain so many photons that seeing quantum effects from each one is impossible. Cavity QED works by confining the light between two nearly perfect mirrors. One then prepares states where there are not millions or billions of photons in the cavity, but rather one or two. When the photon number is so low that individual photons can be seen, the photons behave quantum mechanically. Many-body cavity QED consists of these photons interacting with atoms that behave quantum mechanically as well. This project will study how these systems respond when they are kicked out of equilibrium, which is anticipated to give qualitatively new features due to the quantum mechanical push and pull between the light and the matter. These interactions should further provide applications down the road in a variety of quantum technologies, such as next-generation lasers and high-precision sensors.<br/><br/>The research will be complemented by an educational program built around designing a virtual reality (VR) module allowing users to interact with simple quantum mechanical systems such as the hydrogen atom. By virtually shrinking the user to the size of the hydrogen atom, the VR module will enable them to interact with the quantum mechanical world directly. From an educational standpoint, the quantum VR module will provide a new route to learn about the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics without the mathematical overhead. This will create understanding and excitement which is relevant to training next-generation scientists and engineers, as quantum mechanics becomes an increasingly indispensable part of science and technology.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education into nonequilibrium states of interacting light and matter. Time-periodic, or Floquet, driving is one of the most powerful tools for engineering quantum systems. Traditionally, a strong high frequency drive is used to modify the effective Hamiltonian, enabling the realization of artificial structures such as strong effective magnetic fields in neutral atoms. Recently, new phases of matter have been discovered that exploit the fundamentally nonequilibrium nature of the Floquet drive. Examples such as the Floquet time crystal were quickly realized after their theoretical discovery, opening the door for novel nonequilibrium routes to symmetry breaking.<br/><br/>In practice, the Floquet drive is often done by microwave or optical photons. Confining these photons to a cavity, they may also be treated as quantum degrees of freedom, a paradigm known as many-body cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The semiclassical Floquet limit is obtained when the cavity photon occupation is large, but cavities afford the intriguing possibility of going to quantum limit by decreasing the photon number, thus accessing a different regime of strongly coupled quantum light and matter.<br/><br/>This research will study the many-body cavity QED limit of nonequilibrium Floquet phases of matter. Doing so naturally leads to new nonequilibrium states of matter with anomalous behavior, which may be thought of as arising from competition between native local interactions and global interactions mediated by the cavity. The research will involve three broad directions: (1) understanding the competition between thermalization and many-body localization in a cavity, (2) demonstrating symmetry breaking states such as time crystals in the presence of the cavity, and (3) classifying topological states of matter coupled to one or more cavities, including quantized photon pumps.<br/><br/>This work will bridge the active but mostly independent fields of many-body cavity QED and Floquet physics, providing a pathway to new phases of matter that lie between the limits that are often considered. The research team will extend the classification of nonequilibrium phases of matter, where anomalous states induced by the interplay of short- and long-range interactions remain particularly challenging. Experimental realizations will be explored in nitrogen vacancy centers, superconducting circuits, ultracold atoms, and trapped ions. The resulting entangled states of strongly coupled light and matter will have relevance to the fundamental science of quantum information and applications in quantum metrology.<br/><br/>This research will be complemented by designing a virtual reality (VR) module allowing users to interact with simple quantum mechanical systems. The quantum VR will illustrate some key aspects of quantum mechanics, such as the wave nature of electrons, quantum measurements, and radiative decay, which have proved elusive to many learners. This is vital for both public science and technological applications as quantum technologies become increasingly relevant, lowering the barrier to entry for scientists, engineers, and members of the public. Feedback from users will serve as a seed for future development of visualization methods in a broader range of quantum systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enzyme is molecule important for the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) in methanogens, which are single cell microorganisms that can be found for example in the human gut and in wetlands. These organisms are very efficient at transforming dihydrogen (H2) and CO2 from the environment in which they live into methane.  In contrast, artificial way to capture and transform H2 and CO2 are much less efficient. Furthermore while the enzymes, in particular mono-iron hydrogenase, utilize earth abundant metals like iron and nickel, many synthetic analogues of the enzymes utilize precious metals like platinum, iridium or palladium. The research of Professor Rose focuses on understanding how the mono-iron hydrogenase catalyzes the chemical transformation in the methanogens and applying this understanding to developing artificial catalysts as efficient as the enzyme. Professor Rose also participates in the outreach program called H2fromH2O. He interacts with high school students in the central Texas region to demonstrate the fundamental science, environmental impact and possible applications for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen and derive energy from this process. The students who participate in the outreach program further disseminate such lessons to their families and communities.  This serves to raise awareness about the importance of developing renewable energy technologies. UT Austin undergraduates directly participate in the outreach efforts, become motivate to do research, and pursue job opportunities and graduate education in energy-related fields.<br/><br/>The available, iron-based synthetic (artificial) systems of a molecular nature do not replicate the speed and efficiency of the naturally occurring system. This research seeks to understand how components of the natural system can be incorporated to provide for enhanced reactivity. There are three technical approaches to understanding the H2-activating and hydride transfer activity of the enzyme mono-iron hydrogenase. First, synthetic model complexes are hybridized with protein hosts to determine the effect of the protein environment on the spectroscopic properties and functional reactivity of the model complexes (versus stand-alone metal complexes). Second, the ""anthracene scaffold"" strategy for assembling the biomimetic fac-CNS motif is modified with more flexible ""anthranoid"" scaffolds to investigate the role of protein-like flexibility of the donor arms on the reactivity of the model complexes. Third, the complexes contain a biomimetic pyridine moiety, which is hypothesized to assist in H2 heterolysis as a pendant base.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many current, clinical polymer coatings are susceptible to a build-up of proteins on the surface once in the body. While solutions have been proposed, it remains a challenge to combine the ability to repel proteins with other advanced capabilities such as self-healing and controllable drug release. This project focuses on the creation of coatings for devices such as coronary stents, catheters, or artificial implants, which are all in intimate contact with a large variety of biological milieu. Therefore, it is desirable for such coatings to (a) be easy to apply to a variety of biomedically relevant substrates in a controllable manner; and (b) be biocompatible and biodegradable with predictable, non-toxic degradation components. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is chosen as a powerful means to create conformal coatings of controlled thickness on virtually any surface from all aqueous assembly. This project will explore the ability of novel hybrid polymers, which are based on an inorganic backbone with structurally diverse organic pendant groups, to assemble via the LbL technique, undergo controlled degradation, and facilitate modulated release of bioactive molecules. The goal will be to achieve easy to manufacture biocompatible coatings that combine the desired properties. Advanced instrumental techniques will be used to understand the effects of coating chemistry on ability to self-heal, prevent protein adhesion, and load/release drugs along with the ability to control interactions with biological surroundings.

Current polymer coatings in clinical use are based on traditional commodity polymers, are often deposited on solid surfaces via solution casting using organic solvents, lack desired chemical functionalities, and reliable control over loading and release of bioactives. This proposal aims to (a) explore the fundamental properties of layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies based on novel polyphosphazene (PPz) polyelectrolytes with tailored bio-functionality, (b) probe structure-property relationships through a set of experiments addressing physico-chemical properties of the films, and relate them to protein adsorption and adhesion of smooth muscle and epithelial cells, and (c) explore the combination of self-healing and controlled drug release. This project will involve synthesizing novel PPz polyelectrolytes, which combine a unique mixture of properties (extreme chain flexibility, unprecedented structural diversity, multi-functionality, and controlled hydrolytic degradability). Electrostatic interactions will be used to form well defined polyelectrolyte multilayers, whose thickness and growth patterns will be characterized with ellipsometry. Inclusion of bioactive molecules will be studied through direct self-assembly of PPzs with small charged molecules, while amount loaded and released of small molecules will be studied using LC-MS. Moreover, the interaction of such coatings with human endothelial and smooth muscle cells, adsorption of proteins, (HSA, fibrinogen) and biocompatibility will be assessed. These findings will enable rational design of biocompatible coatings for self-healing and drug-loading for applications such as coronary stents, catheters, or artificial implants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long term, this research has implications on the development of implantable medical devices including artificial joints and valves. Critical for such applications is for the protein to be effectively integrated into the devices. To this end, there is interest in attaching peptides and proteins to non-biological surfaces and materials reliably. The interface between the biomolecules and surface has properties are related to, but quite distinct from, those of the biological components and of the original surface. The three-dimensional structure and resulting function of proteins linked to surfaces can be radically different than in solution.  Defining these differences is challenging. The research group of Dr. Lauren Webb at the University of Texas at Austin is addressing these challenges using a multidisciplinary research program focused on the investigation of biomolecules on rationally-designed and precisely-prepared surfaces. Dr. Webb fosters the participation of high school students in research in her own laboratories. Special emphasis is placed on increasing recruiting efforts in Texas high schools so that the diversity of students engaged in research reflects the diversity of the population of Texas. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the integration of biological molecules with non-biological materials is an area of current scientific interest, the understanding of the differences between the structures and properties of biomolecules attached to surfaces versus biomolecules in solution is relatively limited. Dr. Webb's research addresses the lack of fundamental understanding of what happens to biomolecules such as peptides and proteins in these alternative, substrate-bound environments. Dr. Webb's laboratory is using a unique chemical platform and an advanced set of analytical tools to address these fundamental questions from both an experimental and computational perspective. Gold surfaces are chemically functionalized with the electron-transfer protein azurin and studies of the protein's function are aimed at exploring conditions under which the gold remains stable. The research elucidates the mechanism of nucleation and formation of fibrils from surface-bound strand peptides. It also examines the influence of hydration of nominally dry surface-bound protein on the protein's structure and function. The experimental results are leveraged towards the development, testing, and validation of computational methods that may accurately predict the structure of proteins and peptides attached to artificial surfaces. Dr. Webb's long-term goal is to advance of the chemical understanding of peptides and protein behavior at surfaces so that the understanding reaches similar accuracy and predictability when compared to what is currently possible for solution-phase systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These beams are made of high energy light particles that enter the body and cause water and oxygen to react and split into many different reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS then go on to destroy the genetic material inside a cell, which ultimately leads to the cell?s death. In cancer treatment, radiotherapy is usually not completely effective on its own. Sometimes it misses cancerous cells. Sometimes there?s not enough oxygen for it to create the therapeutic ROS. In fact, it is almost impossible to tell if it is working until a follow up appointment. Because radiation is composed of such high energy particles, not very many molecules directly interact with it; however, it is known that radiation kills cells because genetic material is so susceptible to chemical reactions with these ROS. It makes sense then that a molecular probe made from genetic material should be able to respond to radiation damage. This proposal focuses on designing new artificial biomaterial-based sensors that ?look? almost exactly like the genetic material in your body except cells can?t read it like normal RNA or DNA and it won?t be degraded by enzymes in the body yet radiation affects it the exact same way. These new probes will be designed to target the mitochondria or the ?powerhouse of the cell? to identify how radiation causes damage to cells. Finally, this work proposes to make a new type of nanomaterial that can glow when it is hit by radiation. One day, this sort of material might be able to tell doctors in real time if radiotherapy is working.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages genetic material, causing cell death. The causes of ROS overproduction are various and range from mitochondrial dysfunction to radiation exposure. Hydroxy radicals?reactive ?OH?cannot be eliminated by enzymatic reactions and are uniquely powerful enough to induce single strand breaks in RNA and DNA. Understanding the chemistry of ?OH is essential to address fundamental challenges in a number of arenas at the cellular and tissue levels. Several ?OH sensitive fluorescent probes exist but they lack the sensitivity to detect the single digit ?M concentrations in cells and/or cannot distinguish between ?OH and other ROS. Thus, detecting or exploiting ?OH?one of the most pernicious ROS?is hamstrung by a lack of adequate tools. The objective in this proposal is to optimize new L-RNA oligomers as a biorthogonal tool that can undergo strand scission ?triggered? by ?OH. The research team will show these optimized L-RNA can be synthetically tailored to target cellular organelles to report on ?OH concentrations. Finally, L-RNA strand scission will be triggered as a nano-formulation in the presence of ROS to make a highly selective ?smart? material. The central hypothesis is that L-RNA will undergo single strand cleavage at physiologically relevant ?OH concentrations, is non-toxic, and will not be enzymatically destroyed in vitro or in vivo.  At the conclusion of this proof-of-concept study, the expected outcome will be the validation of L-RNA as a long-lived and targetable sensor in vitro. The groundwork laid here will be further enabling in the development of new ?biorthogonal? DNA and RNA architectures that can work in vivo and in vitro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These networks fulfill a multitude of essential functions, such as providing elasticity to our skin and preventing it from overstretching. Understanding how these macroscopic properties arise from the networks' individual components is thus crucial to our understanding of basic physiological processes, our ability to treat diseases, and the future design of novel materials that mimic biological tissue. Such an understanding remains elusive, however, due to a lack of experimental techniques that can resolve fibrous networks with single filament resolution, while also quantifying their contribution to the large-scale network. <br/>The proposed research aims to establish a microscopy technique that can resolve the contribution of each filament to the overall large-scale properties of the network. It will be applied to collagen networks with and without cells, and to tissue samples from bioprosthetic heart valves.<br/>The proposed research is expected to provide material researchers with a better understanding of micromechanical processes in fibrous biopolymer networks. This work could result in the development of novel materials for guiding cell growth, artificial skin and organs, and new methods for drug delivery that rely on the behavior of biological tissue under mechanical stress. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in an interdisciplinary environment on a unique state-of-the-art instrument, and female high-school students will participate in research as part of an outreach program.

Assumptions made in theories about the micromechanical behavior of this important class of materials will be tested. <br/>Because the method is diffraction limited, networks with mesh sizes larger than the dimensions of the focal spot will be chosen. Networks will be imaged and the stress distribution along filaments will be quantified and visualized. The fiber-precise resolution will be used to study the force generation of cells in collagen gels. Fibrous tissue samples of bioprosthetic heart valves will be tested for signs of degeneration. <br/>The more detailed understanding of the micromechanical behavior displayed by biopolymer networks opens a new opportunity to control cell growth and tissue formation by rationally designed biocompatible and biodegradable materials. <br/>The novel microscopy technique will enable the study of force generation of cells in fibrous networks with single filament resolution, as well as the observation of their force-mediated communication. New insight into mechanical signaling between cells in the extracellular matrix is expected, as well as into the degeneration of bioprosthetic heart valve tissue. <br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in an interdisciplinary environment on state-of-the-art instrumentation in a field that directly benefits national health and prosperity."

These materials are formed by vertically stacking atomic layers such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenide (e.g. molybdenum disulfide) layers. The forces between these layers are relatively weak.  However, they can dramatically change the properties of the system and induce phenomena that are absent in individual layers. By stacking or epitaxially growing different atomic layers on one another, one may design and fabricate artificial materials with unprecedented optical, electronic, and vibrational properties that cannot be achieved in natural crystals. Raman spectroscopy, which is a direct, noninvasive, and sensitive optical probe, is used to explore the interlayer coupling, the interface effect, and the interaction between vibrations and charge carriers in these heterostructures. This research provides crucial guidance in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices using stacked atomic layers. The research activities have a powerful impact on the undergraduate students at the University of Northern Iowa. The principal investigator integrates the research topics into two existing courses. Undergraduates at all levels, including freshman students, are encouraged to participate. The principal investigator also uses departmental contacts with area high schools and collaborates with Physics Education faculty colleagues and the director of the Classic Upward Bound program to involve teachers and students at regional high schools.

This study offers a simple method of characterizing Moire pattern features without using scanning tunneling microscopy; (ii) Explore the electronic, optical, and vibrational properties of complex multilayer van der Waals heterostructures and the indirect-direct gap transition in MoS2 bilayers intercalated with different middle layer materials. This research provides crucial guidance in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices using stacked van der Waals multilayers; (iii) Study van der Waals heterostructures that involve Dirac materials. In particular, the research team investigates the change in the electronic band structure of twisted bilayer graphene after it is placed or sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride. This study probes the change in the electronic and vibrational properties of graphene at the hetero-interface; (iv) Probe the interaction between carriers and interlayer phonons in twisted bilayer graphene devices with a dual-gate. This study explores the Coulomb interaction between two charged graphene layers and the interlayer potential formed upon gating.

Given the unique compositions targeted, the coatings are likely to be extraordinarily non-adhesive and therefore useful for coating not only electronic devices (e.g., ultrathin cell phones, laptops, and flat-screen televisions), but also artificial implants (e.g., heart stents) and nanoparticles for medical applications (e.g., cancer therapy).

Three systems of current technological interest are emphasized: (1) the design and synthesis of multidentate adsorbates for fabricating highly stable thin-film coatings with uniquely controlled surface composition of chemical entities that are either phase incompatible or structurally dissimilar, for the purpose of generating homogeneously mixed heterogeneous ""conflicted"" interfaces; (2) the use of specifically fluorinated adsorbate molecules to generate nanoscale films having well-defined composition and structure, with an ultimate goal of defining the critical elements (e.g., minimum degree of fluorination) needed to construct organic interfaces with controlled hydrophobicity, anti-adhesiveness, and lubricity; and (3) the generation and study of thin-film architectures, including surface-grafted oligomeric films, in which the terminal functional groups mimic the backbones of industrially relevant polymers, with the goal of evaluating the interfacial properties and reactivity of well-defined polymer surfaces.  Advantages offered by the targeted multidentate adsorbates include films with markedly greater stability than those derived from n-alkanethiols, leading in part to advances in nanoscale lubrication, corrosion resistance, nanoparticle stabilization, and anti-adhesive coatings.  Furthermore, due to the restricted surface mobility of the multidentate adsorbates, mixed monolayers of these adsorbates functionalized with disparate chemical tailgroups offer ""conflicted"" organic nanoscale coatings with tailored chemical heterogeneity and controlled nanoscale roughness."

Nature will design a leaf to catch the sun and transport nutrients, subject to the constraining influence of the location of the plant; a soap film will use the least amount of material to span a boundary; humans will design a road system to most efficiently move people and goods from place to place.  The study of what the optimal shapes are for natural and artificial design problems has been a focus of increasingly sophisticated study by mathematicians for centuries, involving techniques from the foundations of calculus, geometry and partial differential equations.  In the past few years, there have been breakthroughs in a number of disparate areas of this subject, but few conferences in the United States that bring together experts from across the range of the subject to meet and exchange perspectives in a single meeting.  This conference aims for such a mixture of ideas.<br/><br/>We list a number of areas where there has been deep recent progress. First, there have been important developments in the basics of geometric measure theory in general metric spaces, both finite and infinite dimensional. There has also been enormous progress in geometrical variational problems, both in a number of areas of regularity theory and in minimax theory for minimal hypersurfaces.

Occasionally, the decision maker can even face an opposing player, informed or not, leading to a so-called zero-sum game. Modeling and analysis of games is very difficult, in large part because of the potential strategic behavior of the two players. This project studies the theory behind a collection of topics in  stochastic control (one decision maker) or games (two opposing players). Some of the models are directly motivated by finance, but the general theory could be applied to  other situations. The first topic aims to  provide a better explanation of how an investor should adjust their investing strategies (proportion in each asset) in the presence of small transaction costs, compared  to not facing such costs. The second topic is a general treatment of stochastic games, with the aim to explain the difference between having an intelligent opponent (another person, acting strategically) and an uninformed one, like nature choosing a worst-case scenario for the decision maker. The third topic is of more technical nature, advancing the mathematical theory behind a peculiar kind of fees that investor can face, namely performance fees.<br/><br/>The present project aims to study three topics in stochastic control and games. The first is a study of multi-dimensional singular control problems, with the main application to approximation of optimal investment strategies with small proportional transaction costs. The goal is to deeper understand the structure of feedback optimal strategies as solutions to reflected stochastic differential equations. The second topic will  study the difference in both modeling and analysis between genuine  zero-sum games and stochastic control under  model uncertainty. While, analytically, these two situations appear to be described by the same Isaacs equation, if the Isaacs condition does not hold, allowing the player to use randomized strategies may lead to different models (and values). Finally, the PI will study the duality theory for investing with performance fees. Preliminary investigation shows that the dual problem is a reflected two-dimensional diffusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the 1930s, scientists have built ever bigger and more expensive machines, called accelerators, to accelerate electrons to more than 99% of the speed of light, which Einstein discovered to be the speed limit of the universe.  At such enormous speeds, electrons can probe into nature's deepest subatomic secrets, irradiate cancerous tumors, and generate powerful x-rays that measure the structure of molecules essential to life.  One of America's biggest electron accelerators, a 2-mile-long machine called ""SLAC"" (which originally stood for ""Stanford Linear Accelerator Center"") accelerates electrons to 99.99999999% of the speed of light.  The energy carried by such an electron, at 30 giga-electronvolts (GeV), is less than a mosquito uses to flap its wings once, but it's a lot of energy for one electron.   The goal of this research project is to enable tabletop electron accelerators that are thousands of times smaller and less expensive than SLAC, but which can nevertheless accelerate electrons to the same energy as SLAC does.  The new technology is a long, narrow pipe made of plasma, or ionized gas (the same state of matter one finds inside fluorescent light bulbs and stars).  This pipe is a ""racetrack"" that is intended ultimately to confine and guide electrons, and a powerful laser pulse that fuels their acceleration, until they reach 30 GeV. A separate powerful laser will be used to shape the fluid-like plasma into a pipe.  Computer calculations will be used to understand how the plasma pipe forms, and a model version of the pipe will be demonstrated in the laboratory.   <br/><br/>This two-year project will elucidate the science underlying the formation of cylindrical plasma waveguides with axial electron density in the range between 1 and 3 times 10^17 particles per cm^3 and radius of ~50 m.  Such waveguides can ultimately guide 100 J, 150 fs drive pulses from the Texas Petawatt (PW) Laser in a low-order mode at relativistic intensity up to the pump depletion limit, in order to extend the performance of a single-stage 2 GeV laser-plasma electron accelerator to the tens-of-GeV level.  The channel formation method is based upon physical principles developed during the 1990s, but is being extended to ~20x lower plasma density.  Formation of short (~1 cm) channels in tenuous He plasma will be demonstrated, using 2J, 80-300 ps drive pulses available in the laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.  This prototype setup will enable the duration, energy and focus of channel-forming pulse, and the pre-ionization and doping conditions that optimize plasma heating and channel formation at low plasma density to be discovered.  Simulations of channel formation in tenuous helium, and channeled propagation of relativistic laser pulses, by the research group at the University of Colorado Boulder will guide experiments.  The intellectual merit lies in discovering laser-plasma conditions that optimize formation of high quality, single-mode plasma channels of lower density than ever previously demonstrated.  The broader impacts include developing plasma waveguide technology that may ultimately extend single-stage energy gain of future laser-plasma accelerators to levels typical of SLAC; advancing the careers of three doctoral students from historically under-represented groups; and introducing an undergraduate student to professional research."

Useful applications range from aircraft to automobiles to bridges.  These structural materials are composed of microscopic crystals called grains.  The sizes, shapes, and orientations of grains control a material's mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility.  These microscopic features, part of the material microstructure, are determined by the manufacturing processes that produce and shape materials into useful machine components.  Manufacturing frequently requires deformation at elevated temperatures, the modern equivalent of hot forging by the ancient blacksmith, to control the material microstructure and final component shape.  During hot deformation, grains change size and shape in ways that we cannot yet predict or fully explain.  This project addresses the fundamental science behind the changes in grain shape, size, and orientation during hot deformation.  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms responsible for these changes.  Through this scientific understanding, opportunities are sought to: 1. improve material performance and 2. identify manufacturing methods that create improved material microstructures.  Both graduate and undergraduate students are educated and trained through experimental research.  Primary-school teachers are provided summer research experience, training, and resources to bring to their classrooms.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Dynamic grain growth involves changes in grain shape, size, and orientation during deformation at elevated temperatures.  It is critically important to the processing of many technologically useful metals and alloys.  However, the mechanisms that cause it are not yet understood.  This experimental study assesses the leading hypothesis among several proposed for mechanisms that control dynamic grain growth.  The hypothesized mechanism of subgrains driving high-angle grain boundary migration is investigated for (mechanically) steady-state plastic deformation of body-centered-cubic metals at elevated temperatures.  The goal of this study is to characterize and quantitatively measure the effects of subgrain interactions with high-angle boundaries during both dynamic normal grain growth and dynamic abnormal grain growth.  Recent advances in high-resolution analysis of electron back-scattered diffraction data are leveraged to provide quantitative characterization of subgrain interactions with grain boundaries.  An improved understanding of dynamic grain growth will provide capabilities for predicting and controlling material microstructures during hot deformation processing.  This will benefit manufacturing and domestic competitiveness.  Integrated with the proposed research are training and educational activities for both graduate and undergraduate students. Outreach involves primary-school teachers participating in a summer program of research experience and curriculum development to positively impact their own students.  This outreach focuses on imparting an accessible understanding of materials through hands-on projects and examples that utilize the aesthetic beauty of microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will make these measurements using an experiment that they have built for the Z-machine at Sandia National Laboratories.  The experiment is capable of producing hydrogen, helium, and carbon plasmas that are similar to those in white dwarf  photospheres.  Accurate atomic spectral line parameters measured in these laboratory plasmas would allow astronomers to accurately diagnose plasma conditions at the surfaces of white dwarf stars and test theories of line broadening there.

How humans learn is a topic of intense study in many diverse fields including psychology, linguistics, and the neurosciences. Learning to categorize is particularly crucial for humans and other animals in our interactions with our environments - whether it is a friend or a foe, edible or non-edible, the word /bat/ or /hat/ etc. As we learn to categorize information, our brain and behavior fundamentally change. These longitudinal trajectories evolve differently in different individuals and across brain systems. While recording and analyzing human behavior and neural function have become sophisticated, statistical methods for characterizing local similarities and differences in the underlying neural and behavioral process dynamics across individuals and groups are still emerging. This project aims to address this critical gap through the development of novel statistical frameworks for complex behavioral data on learning in adults. This collaborative project will provide trainees with experiences in a broad range of interdisciplinary topics.<br/><br/>A common theme underlying the statistical research undertaken in this project is the assessment of the local dynamic behavior of the learning processes - how similar or different these processes are, including especially how similarly or differently they might be influenced by the associated predictors, across learning stages and brain networks. Through innovative adaptation and amalgamation of classical ideas and recent advances in diverse areas in statistics, including sparsity inducing priors, tensor factorization techniques, functional data analysis methods, locally informative sampling strategies, etc., novel generic statistical frameworks and associated computational machinery for local inference in longitudinal settings will first be developed. This frameworks will then be adapted to specific models for neural learning processes. The principal investigators will use carefully designed learning experiments in one domain of research - how adults learn novel speech categories and theories to validate the results obtained by the new statistical models. While human speech learning is an interesting and well-studied problem on its own, insights gained from this application are generalizable to other domains of studies that involve human learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neal Waxham at University of Texas (UT) Health-Houston to investigate the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. The initiation of learning begins with changes at neuronal synapses that can strengthen (or weaken) the response of the synapse. This process is termed synaptic plasticity. Stimuli that produce learning lead to structural changes of the post-synaptic dendritic spine. The initial events of memory and learning include a temporary rise in calcium concentrations and activation of a protein called calmodulin. The next step is activation of calmodulin-dependent enzyme, kinase II (CaMKII).  At the same time, structural rearrangements occur in the actin cytoskeleton leading to an enlargement of the spine compartment. How these initial events lead to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is largely unknown. This project focuses on the events that lead to the changes in actin cytoskeleton. The research also addresses the question of how these structural changes in the actin cytoskeleton are used to maintain memory. State-of-the-art computational modeling is used to answer these questions. Modeling is applied at molecular and supra-molecular scales. The models examine molecular changes that bridge the time scales between the initial steps and start of synaptic plasticity. The computational modeling goes hand in hand with state-of-the-art structural and functional imaging and biochemical pathway analyses. The research allows graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in computer simulations and mathematical modeling of a subcellular system. The students and fellows acquire an understanding of the brain starting from a molecular level.  The team of theoreticians and experimentalists working cooperatively on this problem strengthens the training process. This project is integrated into an outreach program to introduce undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to science by participating in the research.<br/><br/>This research project quantitatively characterizes the relevant molecular processes involved in the dynamical ""tectonic"" reorganization inside a dendritic spine involved in forming memories.  It focuses on the actin cytoskeleton using computer simulations and experimental analyses at both molecular and supra-molecular scales. This study therefore contributes directly to understanding the role of mechanics and structure in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Explicitly, the hypothesis is that the transient effects from calcium influx create, in a CaMKII-dependent manner, changes in the spatial patterning of the actin structure. Such changes may be be stabilized by feedback loops with prion-like proteins. These stabilized structures may be a type of ""structural engram"" which then serves as long-term reservoir for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength in the postsynaptic neuron. Testing, modifying, and verifying this hypothesis may help point the way towards a more quantitatively-sophisticated approach to the first stages of learning and memory in the brain."

Analyzing this big biomedical data is critical to discovering disease biomarkers, making advances in personalized medicine, and understanding the basic workings of complex biological systems.

In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS,  COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training.  Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression. Deep learning predictive models can then be used for making predictions about the future COVID-19 dynamics, which can be compared to the predictions made by the original SEIR model. Depending on which mathematical model makes better predictions, another model can be updated with the better prediction as inputs, thereby representing reinforcement learning from both data and the best mathematical model. As a result, the new predictive framework will allow one to assess impacts of the immediate responses such as declaration of a national emergency, a school closing, or a quarantine, and can be considered as a step toward interpretable AI for COVID-19 biosurveillance.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether it is the spectacular, delicate dance of the unblemished, white swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, or the early attempts of a toddler to use his or her hands, the neurology of movement is uniquely common for all animals and humans: learning a motor skill, and the necessary muscle coordination. With practice the skill is perfected. Finally, the retainment of this experience-based learning process is the conclusion of this learning process. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide new tools to neuroscientists who study the biological basis of learning at the cell level using live animals. This function is facilitated by a number of anatomical changes in the structure of the cytoplasm of neural cells, such as the formation of lengthy branches known as axons and dendrites, and at a fine scale of dendritic spines and axonal buttons. The latter are less anatomically permanent structures arising on the surface of these cytoplasmic extensions. Dendritic spines and axonal buttons form synapses, which are the communication gateways between neurons. The research team will develop mathematical and computational tools for automatizing the study of spine populations in live neurons, and of their time-evolution during learning. The anticipated outcomes will provide neuroscientists with a number of software tools which will automatize the analysis of synaptic strength and its evolution with learning. These findings will contributed to the better understanding the biological mechanisms of autism and drug addictions.<br/><br/>The investigators on this project will develop algorithms for the 3D digital segmentations of dendritic surfaces including spines from 3D images acquired with a certain type of microscope, which uses laser light and works as a scanner by exploiting the natural ability of neurons to fluoresce. They aim to generate accurate binary reconstructions of a dendritic arbor including its spines. The primary challenge in this project is that image acquisition of live neurons has a resolution which provides limited detail of the spines. Often, images contain noise which further complicates the extraction of accurate, binary 3D reconstructions of dendritic surfaces showing spine details. Overcoming this problem is a core goal of the project because spine volume estimation quantifies synaptic strength. These unique challenges lead the investigators to the development of novel mathematical tools for fine scale analysis. They will build ensembles of short in size 3D imaging, 3D-orientation selective, frame-based filters, suitable for sensing curves and surfaces in noisy images. These filters will be designed to respond to local changes of image smoothness. Information obtained from these filters at various scales, will be utilized as input for multilayer, deep-learning inspired neural networks which will determine in an image which voxels belong to spine surfaces. Further algorithmic tools will be developed to track every spine of a dendrite individually over time. The same filtering tools will be used in a different application domain, the generation of illumination neutral images, in real-time. This will help the fast, high throughput removal of the effects of uneven illumination in images inhibiting the detection, by software or the naked eye of contours associated with shapes or textures in a scene. The investigators will develop the mathematical theory of illumination neutralization using concepts from fractal and microlocal analysis. The illumination neutralization algorithm is envisioned to work for real-time video analysis and in conjunction with face verification algorithms with the potential to be used in face recognition, laser microscopy and remote sensing applications."

This research aims to develop novel statistical methods and computational algorithms for such problems drawing motivation from a number of real applications. Working within a nonparametric Bayes framework, the first part of the research project lays emphasis on the importance of calibrating prior distributions in these constrained problems and theoretically quantifying the impact of the constraints on parameter learning. The second part aims to develop efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational algorithms and analyze their convergence behaviors for the said problems. The PIs will also propose undergraduate courses that will focus on the modeling and applied components of Bayesian methods. When teaching the courses, the PIs will use daily life as well as scientific examples across different disciplines to inspire students' learning.

Operating in a Bayesian paradigm which enables incorporation of various constraints in a principled framework and provides readily available uncertainty estimates often sought after in scientific applications, a major emphasis will be laid on calibration of prior distributions under these constrained spaces. Examples will be provided where seemingly innocuous prior choices routinely used in practice can lead to biased inferences in certain specific situations. A rigorous theoretical understanding of such phenomenon will be provided along with development of alternative default priors on these constrained spaces. The methodological and theoretical developments will be accompanied by efficient computational algorithms using novel approximation techniques in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational algorithms that meet the scalability demanded by the specific applications and beyond.

An understanding of the microscopic chemical basis of these functions will enable the design of bioinspired materials and nanomachines.  Such understanding provides important insights into the molecular origins of diseases. A key challenge to achieving this goal is that many molecular motions, e.g. the ?power stroke? of a molecular motor, are both too fast to observe via direct experiments and too slow to model on a computer.  The Makarov research group uses theory to bridge the gap between experimental observations in single molecule studies and computer simulations of biomolecules in action. Through synergy between experiments, theory, and molecular simulations, they are developing accurate models and theories to describe the motion of biomolecules as inferred directly from experimental observations.

In both nature, and in industry, iron nitrides play a fleeting but critical role in capturing nitrogen from the air that we breathe and transferring it to important species (such as fertilizers for crop growth) ? a process known as nitrogen fixation. Despite the importance of iron nitrides in the global nitrogen fixation cycle (and in the marketplace), the study of molecules possessing individual iron nitride units has been hampered by the lack of model complexes.  This project is developing new molecular architectures to access, trap, and study reactive iron nitride compounds.  The goals are to shed light on the steps of the nitrogen fixation cycle and to use lessons learned to develop important, new nitrogen complexes using earth-abundant iron. Importantly, this chemistry utilizes iron which is a sustainable, non-toxic metal ? avoiding the need for costly and toxic precious metals.  This project provides research opportunities for early-career scientists, including students from historically underrepresented groups. UTEP is a minority serving institution with an 80% Hispanic student population. The training and development the students receive is critically important for preparing the next generation of domestic science and technology personnel capable of competing in the global marketplace. On top of this, in an effort to encourage an active role in their learning, a student-directed seminar involves students in the hosting and organization of departmental seminars twice per semester.

Optimal control problems are a systematic tool to infer knowledge from data, enabling scientific discovery and decision making. They are typically formulated as data-fitting problems with dynamical systems (the simulation problem) as constraints. This simulation problem describes the possible behavior of a natural or engineered system under investigation for given values of input variables (for example, brain tumor and tumor growth rates). In practice, the values are typically not known and cannot be measured directly. One needs to infer them from observational data (for example, a series of patient images) by optimizing a performance goal. This process constitutes the control problem; the unknown variables are the controls of the simulation problem. Solving optimal control problems poses significant mathematical challenges. The project will consider control problems that can have up to billions of unknowns. For decision making, one needs to equip the solutions of the control problem with confidence intervals. This is achieved using a statistical framework, which adds massive computational costs. Moreover, distinct control variable realizations can yield simulation outputs that match the observational data equally well, leading to what is known as ill-posed problems. To alleviate this ambiguity, prior knowledge about plausible solutions can be introduced based on regularization models. However, choosing adequate regularization models remains a significant challenge. This project aims to provide fast, scalable, and robust software tailored to modern computing architectures to address the massive computational costs. The project will focus on learning appropriate regularization models from data. The area of application is statistical shape analysis for classifying objects, and, in particular, the classification of patients (diseased versus healthy) based on the anatomical shape variability of organs. Upon completion, the research will produce a generic mathematical and algorithmic framework for transport-related optimal control problems and more generally inverse problems, along with software infrastructure that applies to a range of problems in (biomedical) imaging sciences, atmospheric sciences, computer vision, remote sensing, data science, and deep learning. The project will provide training for two graduate students and summer research projects for undergraduates.<br/><br/>The research will develop effective, scalable computational methods for nonlinear optimal control of geodesic flows of diffeomorphisms. The novelty is the design of hardware-accelerated computational kernels and efficient numerical schemes that exploit problem structure and rigorously follow mathematical principles for studying shape variability. This is achieved through the design of a Bayesian framework for statistical shape analysis. The quantification of shape variability of distinct realizations of an object under investigation is done through the lens of geodesic flows of diffeomorphisms that map one object to another. In particular, one quantifies the proximity between two shapes by the length of the geodesic path that connects them. From a statistical point of view, one can study shape variability in a database by identifying an average geometry (the ""statistical template"") of a particular object under investigation, and then studies how individual datasets deviate from this average. The project will focus on adaptive, hierarchical numerical schemes, enabling high-accuracy computations if desired, and low-accuracy approximations when possible. The solvers will feature fast computational kernels, maximizing single-node, and single-GPU throughput while maintaining scalability on (heterogeneous) high-performance computing platforms. Work packages include preconditioning, fast hierarchical computational kernels for evaluating forward and adjoint operators, mixed-precision implementations on heterogeneous architectures, and computational methods that exploit problem structure to speed up the solution and allow for high acceptance rates when sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions. In particular, the project will provide methodology for (i) the solution of nonlinear initial value control problems, (ii) uncertainty quantification, (iii) statistical template estimation from large imaging databases, and (iv) learning regularization operators from data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are compounds in which quantum physics plays an essential role in enabling exceptional electronic or magnetic properties.  Quantum materials may enable new electronic devices, perhaps based on high temperature superconductivity or topologically robust quantum circuits. Superconductors can carry electric current without dissipation while topological states are new states of electronic matter that may enable quantum computation. An obstacle to realizing this potential has been the complexity often exhibited by these systems. This CAREER award supports the investigation of a new theoretical paradigm to tackle this issue, inspired by so-called many-body localization. In quantum physics, particles can behave like waves. Many-body localization is the idea that the interference between quantum waves can ""freeze"" the dynamics of interacting electrons, producing different classes of quantum states with different properties. In this project, ideas from the theory of localization will be applied to systems of many interacting electrons, with the view that the statistical classification of different types of excited many-body states may prove essential for determining properties in complex materials. This is very different from the usual approaches that stress the properties of the ground state at the absolute zero of temperature. In particular, if successful, the statistical approach developed here will provide new theoretical tools to characterize the complex behavior that arises from the melting of competing electronic phases. Understanding the latter may be a key to unlocking the potential of quantum materials for technological applications.  The PI will also investigate the role of strong electron-electron interactions on the transport of electric charge and heat in quantum materials.<br/> <br/>An educational component of the project aims to make modern mathematical tools more accessible to undergraduate physics majors by emphasizing algorithms and visualization. In the U.S., physics majors are currently taught mathematics developed prior to the 20th century, yet research now employs many more modern mathematical tools. These can be presented to undergraduates using an algorithmic, problem-solving, approach. The PI will create learning modules that will be tested in the classroom and openly disseminated via a permanent Rice-hosted web repository. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education to advance understanding Quantum materials. The rich variety of collective phenomena exhibited by quantum materials holds great promise for technology. An obstacle to realizing this potential has been the complexity often exhibited by these systems. Due to the interplay of interactions, frustration, and material disorder, many compounds exhibit competing low temperature phases. These are often found in proximity to quantum critical regimes that may arise from fluctuations of the many different ordered states. It is now believed that quantum wave interference can induce the Anderson localization of a many-particle interacting system, in the presence of disorder or frustration. This many-body localization suggests a paradigm shift to the statistical classification of many-particle states, instead of a singular focus on the ground state. Transport measurements are the primary probe of quantum interference, but understanding transport in correlated materials remains a challenge. <br/>Project goals include: bringing statistical methods developed in one-body Anderson localization physics to bear on quantum many particle systems, and revealing correlation-dominated transport effects in non-Fermi liquids. The focus is on low-dimensional quantum critical regimes and driven topological systems. The goal of the educational component is to make available more modern mathematical tools to physics and STEM students and workers.<br/><br/>Specific research and education objectives are to:<br/>1) Test the hypothesis that the many-body localization transition can be continuous, and investigate the physics of the ""bad metal"" phase predicted to occur above it.<br/>2) Test the hypothesis that ""clustering"" between the probability peaks of different many-body states determines the relaxation dynamics in the bad metal phase, and investigate competing orders in the presence of inhomogeneity and one-body state Chalker scaling.<br/>3) Investigate new transport effects that directly reveal the influence of correlations, by exploiting novel geometries for edge loop drag and quantum quench dynamics in 2D topological insulators, and by sharpening the roles of virtual and real collisions in the thermoelectric transport of correlated electron fluids.<br/>4) Develop and disseminate virtual learning modules for topics in modern mathematics accessible to undergraduate physics majors, emphasizing algorithms and visualization. The PI will create learning modules starting with Lie algebra representation theory, and these will be tested in the classroom and openly disseminated via a permanent Rice-hosted web repository.<br/><br/>Ideas germinated from many-body localization may lead to insight into the interplay of competing orders, disorder, and frustration in correlated electron systems; however, many fundamental questions regarding the nature or even the existence of the many-body localization transition currently are unanswered, particularly in dimensions higher than one. The approaches will (a) introduce improved models amenable to exact numerical or analytical solutions, and (b) exploit the proximity of a 2D many-body localization transition to a special zero temperature Anderson-Mott transition. Competing orders and critical delocalization will be studied in an interacting version of an integrable quasicrystal model. The PI's investigation of thermoelectric transport will be in collaboration with experimentalists who are experts on graphene, and will help disentangle the roles of hydrodynamics, quasiparticle and transport lifetimes in marginal Fermi liquids."

Most polymeric molecules possess structural flexibility at the nanometer and subnanometer scales, which leads to various 3D shapes that they can adopt. Such geometric variability impacts a wide range of polymer properties that are important for their applications, especially those related to electronic and optical properties. Precision control of the molecular shapes of semiconducting polymers, however, has been a long-standing scientific challenge. This CAREER project tackles this problem by synthesizing molecules with reversible and controllable interactions between different segments along the polymer chain. Through this approach, planarized geometries of these polymer molecules can be enforced and disrupted on demand, leading to tailored properties as a result of the switchable molecular shapes. Establishment of this structural control may not only enable the access of improved functional performance, but also allow for feasible processing of polymer materials into application-relevant forms. In addition, the knowledge gained in this project will advance fundamental understanding in materials-related sciences and benefit multiple research disciplines and STEM education. The educational component of this program focuses on connecting scientific concepts and real-world personal knowledge for the students through relevant experiments in the lab and immersive learning experiences.

Through a synergistic approach combining chemical synthesis, process engineering, and materials characterization, the research project seeks to establish clear fundamental correlations between controlled torsional conformation and materials properties of pi-conjugated systems. This plan is driven by the underlining hypothesis that active control over torsional conformation can significantly impact polymer properties and processability.  The key strategy to achieve this objective is the incorporation of controllable intramolecular dynamic bonds into polymer backbones. A systematic design principle to the synthesis and process engineering of such polymers will be developed on the basis of theoretical simulations and experimental feedback. Structure-property relationships of these materials will be investigated through iterative design-test-feedback-optimization cycles. The ultimate goal is to draw a clear structure-property correlation and to establish design principles for tailoring the integrated properties of conjugated polymeric materials. In parallel, educational and outreach activities are planned to enhance chemistry and broad STEM learning outcome synergistically with the research program. The pedagogical focus is to make the essential connections between scientific knowledge and real-life experiences for the next generation of STEM students through an integrated plan combining course development, undergraduate research programs and outreach activities."

Hung-Jen Wu and Joseph Kwon from Texas A&M University to develop a next-generation glycoarray tool that can be used in the study of the complex interactions between glycans and lectins, both of which are biomolecules found in living systems. More specifically, lectins are proteins that recognize and bind glycans, which are carbohydrate molecules; the binding between lectins and glycans plays an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Lectin-glycan binding has several important features.  Firstly, it is not highly specific; a lectin often binds to different glycan structures with different affinities. Most lectins bind to glycans via multivalent interactions, i.e. multiple binding domains of a single lectin simultaneously interact with multiple glycan molecules. Moreover, glycans attached to lipids or membrane proteins can diffuse on two-dimensional cell membranes. These features distinguish the lectin-glycan interactions from classic bimolecular interactions such as those between antibodies and antigens. Existing methods for lectin analysis miss these essential characteristics, and thus often fail to describe some unexpected phenomena in glycobiology. The goal of this research project is to establish a next-generation glycoarray tool that fills this critical need and makes possible the discovery of the lectin-glycan recognition principles. The project also involves the development of a project-based learning program that focuses on supporting the learning by high school students of chemistry and nanoscience topics. The students participants are engaged in hands-on experiments and interactive activities. Drs. Wu and Kwon's team is converting the educational program to an open-access web-based course for teachers with the goal of increasing the impact of their STEM outreach efforts.<br/><br/>Drs. Wu and Kwon are developing a high-throughput nanocube sensor array to quantitatively measure lectin-glycan interactions in an environment that mimics the cell membrane. In addition, a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation is being developed for modeling complex lectin-glycan interactions. This novel glycoarray tool that integrates analytical assay and computational modeling allows one to measure fundamental microscopic binding parameters, which in turn can be used in the prediction of lectin functions on complex cellular surfaces. The tool makes possible the simultaneous examination of the influence of semi-specificity, multivalency, and ligand diffusion on lectin-glycan recognition. The analysis of the lectin-glycan recognition pattern becomes highly accessible, flexible, and inexpensive. End users can conduct measurements in their own laboratories without specialized equipment by following a step-by-step guide included in the sophisticated modeling software. The detection tool is compatible with a variety of glycan-binding species, including toxins, bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells; consequently, it can benefit a wide range of scientific communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first one is the optimal denoising  and decomposition of signals and images.  Analysis of functional magnet resonance images (fMRI) in the human brain is a particular example of application. Loosely speaking, fMRI is a noisy time series of images which reflects the level of oxygen in blood during measurements.  Because this is about dealing with oxygen in blood,  the time series contains respiratory, cardiac and neural response to functional stimuli. The proposed statistical procedure will allow doctors and bioengineers to separate and denoise these components, with potential applications in developing new methods for diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases. The second topic is  the estimation of large cross-covariance/correlation  matrices for noisy signals, with the number of elements in millions and  sample sizes  of just several hundreds. This is a familiar problem  in statistical analysis of Chip-on-chip microarrays used to study bacteria. Another application is the study of neural plasticity, which is the ability of the brain to recognize neural pathways based on new experience and change in learning. This will allow physicians to create new methods for early diagnosis and treatment of stroke which is  the  4th leading cause of death in the US. The third topic is adaptive and  efficient estimation of hazard rate and survival function from indirect observations, including new methodology of sequentially controlled experiments and protocols. This research is motivated by new methods of radiation and drug therapy for lung and breast cancers as well as by innovative technologies of  waste-water treatment and the actuarial problem of developing adaptive life tables.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three objectives. (1) Advance knowledge and understanding of nonparametric curve estimation to develop a general theory of shrinking local minimax estimation that allows statisticians to get  a new benchmark for the quality of estimation and generate a family of more accurate estimators. Preliminary results indicate that new efficient estimators can be proposed either via mimicking oracles or via aggregation of different estimators in frequency domain. Most challenging and rewarding results are expected for multivariate curves where new rates can remedy the familiar curse of multidimensionality. Applications in statistical analysis of microarrays, fMRI, radiation and drug therapy of cancer cells, and  innovative technologies of  waste-water treatment are expected.(2) Develop new methods of inference for large cross-covariance/correlation matrices for noisy signals, based on wavelet methods and exponential inequalities that can be applied to dependent and non-Gaussian observations. The main application is the study of neural plasticity of the human brain. This allows doctors and bioengineers to  observe changes in neural pathways based on new experience and change in learning with applications to treatment of stroke and other brain diseases.(3) Improve nonparametric theory and create efficient methods of hazard rate and survival function estimation for indirect observations, including a new methodology of sequentially controlled experiments and protocols."

As such, they are useful forensic probes for studying the end stages of the stellar life cycle. A white dwarf is a compact star that contains the mass of the Sun within a volume comparable to that of the Earth (about a million times smaller).  White dwarfs no longer undergo nuclear fusion like the Sun, but continue to glow from residual heat for billions of years.  A research group at Texas A&M University-Commerce will carry out a program to use data from the Gaia space mission combined with observations from ground-based telescopes to double the sample of known WDs in young open clusters, or groupings of a few thousand stars of about the same age.  These scientists will use this large sample of WDs to address several open questions in a range of astrophysical areas including: variability in total mass lost by stars during late stages of stellar evolution, the lower mass of the progenitors of supernovae, or stellar explosions, the evolution of close multiple star systems, and the fate of planetary systems.  This project will expand an existing successful effort to improve undergraduate student learning and retention in introductory STEM classes by providing funding to train and mentor undergraduate learning assistants for revised, learner-centered introductory astronomy courses.  The project will also offer first-generation college students and underrepresented students from depressed rural areas opportunities to participate in astronomy research.<br/><br/>White dwarf stars in open star clusters are versatile and powerful forensic probes for studying the end stages of the stellar life cycle.  In particular, white dwarf studies allow us to constrain the total mass lost by stars during their post-main sequence evolution, the lower mass limit for core-collapse supernova progenitors, the formation rate of double degenerate systems, rotation rates of red giant cores and their coupling to the star's envelope, and white dwarf atmospheric and structural evolution.  White dwarfs in open star clusters are especially useful tools in large part because the many crucial stellar parameters are known, including total age (white dwarf cooling time plus progenitor lifetime) and metallicity.  The project builds on earlier studies of white dwarf stars in open clusters made by the investigators; parallax and proper motion data from the Gaia mission and multi-epoch deep imaging of open clusters virtually eliminates uncertainties in cluster membership, vastly reducing the number of inferences currently made in the published literature.  Through the use of national, state and local university facilities, the researchers expect to nearly double the number known open cluster white dwarfs and to be able to implement ensemble studies of white dwarf formation and evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, due to the unique kinetics of this self-assembly, the project will utilize a focused ultrasound transducer to produce patterned, cell-laden and tissue engineered constructs. This work will develop a unique platform to explore the rational design of materials for applications in tissue engineering, where a microstructured and degradable material is needed with biologic specificity. The proposed studies are unique in that they offer a tailorable platform for the precise definition of cell and tissue responses, and the design strategy could be broadly applied for the development of other biomaterials.

Nontechnical Abstract<br/>Metals and their alloys are critically important to the production of structural components required in the complex machines supporting modern society.  Examples of metallic structural components are readily evident in automobiles, aircraft, bridges and buildings.  Less obvious are the microscopic features inside these materials that control their properties and enable them to effectively serve in the most demanding tasks, features that are collectively called the microstructure.  The microstructure includes grains, small individual crystals of the metal, that determine strength, ductility and other material properties.  The grain structure must be controlled during manufacturing of each component if it is to achieve the properties required for its technological application.  This project seeks to build the science of how grains develop and grow while metals are deformed at elevated temperatures, an important processing step in a wide variety of metals manufacturing operations.  The growth of grains under these conditions is called dynamic grain growth.  The new understanding produced under this project is expected to positively impact future manufacturing practices for the forming of metals.  Through participation in this scientific investigation, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels are trained.  An integral aspect of this project is a partnership with ASM International on enhancing the open dissemination of research results so that valuable data can most positively impact the scientific and engineering communities, as well as broader society.<br/><br/>2. Technical Abstract<br/>Dynamic grain growth is a topic of great technological importance to the manufacture of wrought metal and alloy products.  Yet, it is also a topic within metals science for which we have only a very limited understanding.  This experimental research project seeks to produce new understanding for the mechanisms that cause dynamic grain growth, better establish why grain boundary migration behaviors are different between the dynamic and static cases, and organize these new understandings to positively impact manufacturing technologies.  The mechanisms responsible for dynamic grain growth in body-centered-cubic metals are a primary focus.  Both dynamic abnormal grain growth and dynamic normal grain growth are addressed.  The materials studied include the refractory metals, molybdenum and tantalum, and iron-based alloys.  The iron-based alloys include commercially important interstitial-free steels, which provide both a nearly ideal model material for scientific investigation and a material of technological relevance.  Experiments are designed to test new hypotheses for the relationship between dynamic normal and dynamic abnormal grain growth; probe existing hypothesis for the mobility of grain boundaries under dynamic conditions; and explore questions for which no hypotheses currently exist.  Experimental methods include unique mechanical testing, modern characterization techniques, advanced computerized data analysis techniques and interpretation through numerical models."

Amines are organic compounds derived from ammonia by replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms by organic groups.  Amines are very common in biology such as in amino acids and neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine.   The goal of this research is to convert simple amines into other, more valuable or useful amines. To solve this challenge, Professor Ge and his students are using ""directing groups"" that attach reversibly to the amine group and force the reaction to occur on a specific (desired) site. The summer undergraduate research program attracts college students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, to the STEM areas, training potential future leaders in scientific research.  The engagement of high school teachers provides an active learning environment and enables them to deliver in-depth knowledge of key scientific ideas and practices to their classes. This educational effort, in turn, triggers high school students' curiosity, inspires their interest in chemistry, and attracts more high school students into the STEM areas.<br/><br/>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the project by Professor Haibo Ge of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Professor Ge is developing new methods to construct carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. This reaction chemistry allows for various common organic compounds to be readily accessed in an efficient manner via a C-H bond functionalization process.  It also enables rapid late-stage functionalization (LSF) of complex organic molecules. When compared to conventional cross-coupling reactions, the C-H functionalization process does not require pre-functionalized starting materials and can avoid the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents, making it more environmentally and economically beneficial. The new type of C-H functionalization reactions allows for the use of readily-available organic molecules as starting materials, and thus improves the potential applications of the process. The principal goal of the project is to develop novel transition metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions in order to provide powerful, valuable, and straightforward synthetic approaches to access common organic frameworks. A variety of medically important (hetero)cyclic skeletons are expected to be efficiently accessed from readily-available aliphatic amines and aldehydes via this strategy. The asymmetric functionalization of these strong sp3 C-H bonds is also designed with the use of chiral catalysts. The project focuses primarily on synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry with potential integration of computational and medicinal chemistry. Thus, the project is well-positioned for the education and training of all levels of scientists. Additionally, an outreach program with high school teachers is designed to enable them to deliver in-depth knowledge of key scientific ideas and practices to their classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He and his research group are developing methods to scale exact quantum dynamical molecular simulations across the next generation of massively parallel supercomputers. Molecular simulations promise to enable computers to replace expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments.  Thus, these simulations used routinely in many areas (energy, drug design, nanomaterials, etc). However, most simulations treat the atomic nuclei that make up the molecules as classical particles and ignore quantum dynamical effects of nuclear motion. Quantum effects can be important, and excluding them may lead to unreliable results. Including them, on the other hand, presents daunting numerical hurdles and difficult mathematics. To meet this challenge, Poirier and coworkers are developing the world's first massively parallel exact quantum dynamics code, SwitchIT, which is also designed to be easy to use (even for ""non-experts"") and easy to access (anyone may download the package for free). SwitchIT may thus dramatically improve the accuracy, reliability and true predictive power of molecular simulations, in the many areas where these are employed.  Poirier and coworkers plan to release the SwitchIT as open source and build a user community around the language by ensuring that interested researchers can contribute to the SwitchIT codebase. This permits a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award.<br/><br/><br/>Recent developments in supercomputing technology promise great leaps forward in scientific computation, with the potential to significantly advance a broad range of scientific fields. Increasingly, cutting edge science has come to rely on large-scale interdisciplinary collaboration, shared infrastructure, and massively parallel high performance computers (HPC). At the same time, within the chemical dynamics field, there has been a shift towards larger and more diverse systems, including nanomaterials and biological molecules. Finally, the need to incorporate quantum dynamical (QD) effects in numerical simulations in order to obtain accurate results is becoming increasingly recognized, even for large systems (e.g., electron transport in photosynthesis). The convergence of these trends is inevitable. Yet, due to steep learning curves and/or lack of access, relatively few chemists currently benefit from either HPC or exact QD. Poirier's research seeks to leverage the power of HPC, to enable exact QD calculations for larger and more challenging molecular applications than heretofore realized. Such calculations constitute a pioneering advance over previous exact QD efforts, with massive parallelization a vital CDS&E feature of the approach taken. The implementation also fuses together two linear algebra innovations that: (1) enable efficient parallelization of sparse iterative linear solvers and eigensolvers across 1000 - 10000 cores; (2) use wavelets to reduce the basis size to a manageable level, even for exact QD systems with as many as 12 atoms. ""Expert"" QD practitioners can tap into SwitchIT at a low level to introduce HPC capability into their own QD codes, whereas SwitchIT provides non-experts with an easy-to-use front end and extensive documentation.  In addition, Poirier and group members regularly provide guidance and training, as well as access to the Texas Tech Chemistry Computation Cluster. Poirier's group members themselves receive intensive interdisciplinary training in computational science and next-generation HPC highly relevant skills, e.g., for American competitiveness.  In short, this NSF award extends the complexity of systems that can be studied with exact QD, while simultaneously cyber-enabling a much broader cross section of the community to perform such calculations."

Liquid argon is an excellent medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile ('pulse shape') depends on the nature of the ionizing particle, providing powerful particle discrimination to suppress background from natural radioactivity.

Current methods for measuring the presence of harmful metals in materials in the atmosphere require time-consuming processes to concentrate metal targets, as well as complicated sample preparation methods for the intricate analyses. A major limitation of these existing methods is that atmospheric materials have to be placed in water or other solvents to be analyzed. Significant advances in rapid, heavy metal detection could occur by direct light-based measurement of metals present in gases at the point of their generation (prior to entering the atmosphere). However, our understanding of how to detect heavy metals in gases using fluorescent light-based sensors is hindered by the inability to study molecular-level interactions between a metal of interest and fluorescent receptors that report metal presence. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging technologies may enhance the design of gas-phase sensors for heavy metal ions. These enabling technologies have the potential to offer early-stage detection of metal contamination to help prevent significant harm to human health and the environment. Recent advances in the single-entity fluorescence imaging of ions from gases have been made at the University of Texas at Arlington. This project brings together a unique combination of techniques to create sensitive gas-phase sensors that measure toxic heavy metals, with a focus on lead, mercury, and cadmium as some of the most harmful heavy metals. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers in Dr. Frank Foss Jr.?s laboratory design and make sophisticated fluorescence imaging materials that are placed on optical surfaces.  These materials can then be used to assess presence of metals in the atmosphere. The research and training environment allows for learning about fundamentals of molecule-metal chemistry, photophysics, and cutting-edge approaches to making molecules, as well as scientific literacy and teamwork skills that propel the careers of the scientists in training.<br/><br/>With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program is funding Dr. Frank Foss Jr. at the University of Texas at Arlington to synthesize and study hybrid materials that directly investigate the fundamentals of heavy metal ion capture, surface dynamics, and fluorescence at gas-solid interfaces. Fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic properties are complicated by the seemingly irreversible nature of analyte binding in solvent-less environments and limited by methods that investigate bulk properties of ions on surfaces, rather than molecular properties. Turn-on, single-molecule fluorescence imaging (SMFI) methods have revolutionized our understanding of biomolecular and catalytic events at the molecular level in solution. Preparation of new turn-on fluorescence sensors containing rigid ion-selective receptors with solid-state functioning fluorophores provide SMFI materials that can be incorporated into self-assembled monolayers at gas-solid interfaces. To enhance ion binding selectivity, SMFI-SAMs are modified with solid electrolyte-inspired ion transport materials. Ion sensing and mobility measurements in SMFI-SE-SAMs are studied by microscopy and supported by computational experiments to enhance gas-phase sensing technologies and provide new tools for investigating surface design and function. These studies provide the molecular scale insight necessary for attaining ultra-low levels of detection by rapid gas sensitive fluorescent measurements. This interdisciplinary collaborative project brings together new materials with recently developed microscopy techniques to evaluate the measurement and selectivity of these devices to detect toxic heavy metal ions directly from the gas phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This behavior can be used to develop compact and efficient actuators, sensors, and a variety of microelectronic devices.  Structural transformations start near a defect or imperfection in a material, which facilitates the rearrangement of atoms.  However, when considering transformations in small volumes of material, the probability of encountering such a rare defect is low, resulting in unpredictable and inefficient operation.  In extreme cases, this can stop the transformation from occurring entirely.  This project's aims are to understand the role that defects play in initiating structural transformations, and to find an approach to introduce such defects into a material.  This would allow the operation of devices at micrometer and nanometer length-scales.  The broader objectives of this proposal include developing distributable interactive materials science experiments ('lab in a box') that can be performed remotely to engage distance students.  Additionally, this proposal will engage undergraduate (UG) students, and in particular transfer students from community colleges, through targeted UG research opportunities and through societally impactful engineering design challenges related to the proposed research.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Diffusionless solid-state phase transformations generally nucleate from sparse, high energy atomic-scale defects in the crystal lattice.  One of the grand challenges in materials science is understanding how material heterogeneity and disorder can be harnessed to influence the properties of materials.  In particular, while dislocation defect models of heterogeneous nucleation in martensitic transformations (MTs) are fairly well-developed, the role of clusters of point defects is very poorly understood, despite initial observations that irradiation induced defect clusters can serve as potent nucleation sites. The outcomes of this study will advance the science of nucleation of MTs 1) by measuring the number density of native nucleation sites as a function of thermodynamic driving force, and determining the role of lattice compatibility in governing size-dependent nucleation behavior, and 2) by experimentally quantifying the potency of irradiation-induced defect clusters and He nanobubbles. These observations will be used to develop and test a defect-cluster based MT nucleation model.  The educational outcomes of this proposal will impact two paradigm shifts currently underway in UG engineering education: 1) broader adoption of active learning methods, and 2) effective and scalable approaches to distance education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This new approach to building chemical imaging systems significantly simplifies microscope operation and yields a method for visualizing tiny amounts of sample.  The Baylor team readily investigates chemical reactions on catalyst surfaces in gas and liquid environments. Due to the practical and accessible nature of the new nanoscale chemical imaging tool, the research may impact research in materials, biomedical, and optoelectronic sciences. Professors Zhang and Lee are providing undergraduate and technical college students new learning and research opportunities in optics and scanning probe microscopy.  Such student skill sets are valuable for the students' future careers. The Baylor team is also providing broad, public education and outreach to the Waco community through frequent hands-on optics and spectroscopy events at the Mayborn Museum. <br/><br/>This project develops a user-friendly, tip-enhanced, Raman spectroscopy nanoscale chemical imaging system that is based on an optical alignment-free design, namely, an integrated plasmonic fiber-tip assembly. The fiber-tip assembly can be easily integrated into existing scanning probe microscope designs. This unique approach provides a simple path for independent delivery of excitation light to and collection of light from a sample, which offers high light coupling efficiency and virtually nonexistent far-field background interference. As a result, sample signals are highly sensitive and provide detection limits approaching that of single molecules. The plasmonic nanostructured optical fibers merge the fields of plasmonics and fiber optics, thereby enabling tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy imaging applications in numerous gaseous and liquid environments. The specific objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate nanoscale mapping using fiber-tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy imaging and study the photochemistry of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) at the nanometer scale in a controlled ambient pressure environment.

The activity of these two enzymes is essential to manage metabolic cysteine and taurine concentrations and it is associated with autoimmune and neurological conditions, cellular signaling, energy balance, and fat metabolism. Integrated training is incorporated in the research project, which provides to students comprehensive and hands-on learning opportunities in biochemical and structural biology techniques. A multimedia presentation on electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy will be created and used to provide to students a tangible demonstration of how this advanced spectroscopy can clarify chemical properties of critical biomolecular systems.  <br/> <br/>This research project seeks to reveal the mechanistic implications of adding oxygen atoms to electron-rich sulfur as well as the nature of the catalytic contribution of a protein-derived cofactor.  The thiol dioxygenases utilize a mononuclear ferrous center to facilitate the incorporation of molecular oxygen into the thiol moiety of their respective substrates. These enzymes stand out as unique among dioxygenases because they add two of the oxygen atoms of molecular oxygen to a single substrate atom. Though other dioxygenases have been well studied, thiol dioxygenation is expected to proceed via a distinct mechanism that has not been well established yet. Dr. Liu is investigating the formation of the catalytic ensemble of these enzymes, namely an iron- and oxygen-dependent process for generating a catalytic amplifier known as the protein-derived cofactor. A wide array of techniques, including protein engineering, EPR spectroscopy, stopped-flow rapid kinetics, and protein X-ray crystallography, are employed in the determination of the chemical steps of cofactor biogenesis and sulfur oxygenation. The completion of this project is expected to reveal new mechanistic implications of adding two oxygen atoms to one electron-rich sulfur as well as the nature of the catalytic contribution of the protein-derived cofactor to sulfur metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will provide funding for the research program at SMU that is dedicated to advancing the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment towards its goal of exploring the low mass (< 10 GeV/c^2) dark matter region, and ultimately to having sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections where solar neutrino-nucleus scattering becomes significant (the so-called ?neutrino floor?).

Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have traditionally focused on using nanoparticles derived from metals, silica, polymers, etc. However, some of these materials have encountered roadblocks in their applications. For instance, nanoparticles based on inorganic and polymeric materials typically take a long time in clearing by the body, and possible accumulation in different organs. One possible solution is to make nanoparticles from proteins using non-infectious and non-toxic virus particles as a scaffolding. Conceptually, viruses are ideal for drug delivery system as they have been evolutionarily endowed with all the resources and properties needed to deliver a cargo to specific cells. However, one of the issues holding back in the use of protein-based nanoparticles for drug delivery is the lack of synthetic chemistries under conditions that don't cause unfolding or a denaturation of the proteins of the virus particles during their preparation. One of the thrusts of this proposal is in developing several new reaction methods and building a tool kit for future applications. These new reactions would enable to look at new approaches for drug release from protein-based nanoparticles, including the use of external trigger sources like pulsed laser light. To accomplish this, this project will functionalize the protein nanoparticles with 'photo-thermal antennae' that when struck by the appropriate wavelength of light, will result in the rupture of the capsids and release of their contents (cargo, drugs, etc.) into the cell. An important benefit of this research is that this study is multidisciplinary in nature, and readily lends itself to creating a collaborative environment for student teaching and training. These efforts will be harnessed by giving these students opportunities in creating a web-based comics program, which are expected not only to educate, but also entertain school-aged K-12 children and their parents by telling stories on how nanomaterials interact with the body, and how they could help bring about future drug delivery systems for many biomedical applications. <br/><br/>Technical: <br/>The main objective of this CAREER award is to synthesize thermally responsive protein-based nanoscopic molecular drug delivery system prepared from virus derived nanoparticles that are non-infectious and non-toxic. Many of the current approaches for releasing contents of nanoparticles - either macromolecular or small molecule - depend on exploiting the cellular environment. The significant part of this award is to expand the variety and scope of reactions available for the functionalization of protein-based nanoparticles from virus-like particles QB (VLPs QB). Additionally, this award will study novel approaches in seeking the development of a method to permit cargo release using external sources of radiation - in particular optical radiation. To these ends, this project will focus on two objectives: 1) using a virus-like particles derived from QB as a model, this award will develop bioconjugation chemistries focusing on the disulfide groups found in viral capsid surfaces without significantly undermining the thermal stability of viral particle; and 2) introducing photothermally active receptors (antennae) on the surface of the proteinaceous surface of QB virus particles, and these modified viral particles when exposed to pulsed laser irradiation will cause rapid heating and cooling of the nano carriers resulting in the ruptue of the particles, and this in turn will result in the release of cargo/drug stored inside the VLP. This project, in addition, will demonstrate concurrent bilayer membrane disruption with cargo release as an alternate approach to escape from endosome capture, which in general would result in the degradation of the cargo. The students working in this project, which combines biochemical, physical, and synthetic chemistry, will gain experience and interdisciplinary learning, and these students will be engaging in creating high quality on-line and freely available science oriented and web-based comic strips aimed at K-12 students. These comic strips will be used to promote scientific literacy, and to encourage students and their parents to engage and discuss the ideas and concepts emerging from contemporary research. To that end, the project will take advantage of the unique diversity available at the campus to create multi-lingual comics to engage people from all over the world in the research that is being funded through this award."

Liquid crystal elastomers are rubbery materials that can reversibly change from one shape to another in response to changes in their environment. This shape change occurs without requiring external power and control equipment, which is particularly useful in implantable medical devices where water can disrupt circuitry, batteries are difficult to charge, and space is limited. This research effort will enable the synthesis and fabrication of liquid crystal elastomers, with dimensions smaller than a human hair, which bend, stretch, or twist near body temperature. These small structures will be able to penetrate tissue and the subsequent shape change will enable strong adhesion of synthetic materials to soft, wet, and moving tissues of the human body. This new strategy will address a critical national need for improved tissue adhesives. For example, many common treatments, such as hernia repair, require synthetic materials to adhere to the soft tissue, and adhesion failure leads to increased healthcare-related costs and pain. These smart materials will also serve as powerful tools to demonstrate basic scientific concepts to the next generation of scientists and engineers. <br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/><br/>The proposed work will enable the design of biodegradable physical adhesives using the programmed shape change of microscale liquid crystal elastomers. Microneedle arrays that penetrate soft tissue and then undergo controlled shape change to enhance tissue adhesion are envisioned. The large, programmable, and reversible shape change of liquid crystal elastomers make these materials ideal candidates for the design of active microstructures. This work will overcome three critical limitations currently preventing the use of liquid crystal elastomers in biomedical applications: 1) the temperatures that induce shape change of these materials are too high for use in biomedical applications, 2) the biodegradability of these materials is uncontrolled, and 3) the shape change is difficult to program in 3D microscale structures. This award supports development of liquid crystal elastomer chemistries and post-processing strategies to tune transition temperatures and biodegradability. Furthermore, this award enables micromolding techniques to process these materials in 3D microstructures that undergo complex shape change. These active microstructures will be characterized for the ability to create mechanical adhesion to soft tissue that resists both tensile and shear loading.  Research activities will be coupled to primary, secondary, and post-secondary student interactions, to help train the next generation of STEM graduates. Design-based learning modules will be created and assessed that teach fundamental concepts in chemistry and physics through the constructs of smart materials and medical devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is an outstanding opportunity to reduce this cost by replacing current incandescent and fluorescent lighting with white light emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the color quality and efficiency must be improved further. These LED-based light bulbs produce white light by using a luminescent powder called a phosphor, coating on top of a near-ultraviolet (UV) or blue-emitting LED chip. The phosphor is a key component in these devices because it is critical for the overall efficiency and color of these bulbs; unfortunately, there are only a few viable phosphors available for this application today. Therefore, it is prudent to discover new phosphor systems to fully realize the conversion to new efficient lighting. The researchers are addressing this challenge by developing computational and data-driven methods to predict the properties of phosphors. This approach allows the directed discovery of new phosphors with enhanced optical response. This grant also supports extensive scientific education including sponsoring numerous research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. These students, mostly from underrepresented groups, are learning how to synthesize and characterize phosphors as well as the importance of this energy-efficient technology. The graduate students supported by this work are trained to pursue opportunities in the optoelectronics industry and also across the technology sector where materials science play a crucial role. Finally, the computational products of this research are disseminated through open-source platforms, so all researchers benefit from the scientific developments.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Replacing a traditional light bulb with an energy-efficient, phosphor converted-light emitting diode is one of the easiest ways to decrease electricity consumption. This goal requires the discovery of new phosphor systems, which convert the nearly monochromatic LED light into a broad spectrum white light, to fully make use of this technology. The phosphors investigated in this project are based on wide band gap materials (hosts) that contain a small amount of activator (rare-earth element). Depending on the host:activator combination, colors across the visible spectrum are obtained. The central hypothesis driving this research is that the quantum efficiency and thermal quenching resistance of a phosphor are related to the local coordination environment of the activator ion. This research employs advanced first-principles calculations, local structure analysis using X-ray and neutron scattering, and data science to establish a quantitative understanding of this relationship. Modeling these properties using computational tools and confirming the predictions through materials synthesis and characterization produces a feedback loop where our research results are improved with each discovery. The outcome is a series of design rules that will lead to the discovery of new phosphors with superior optical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, next-generation modeling and analysis is computationally challenging using existing tools.  Tailored numerical methods have the potential to address such limitations.  For example, projection-based reduced order models decrease computational costs associated with many-query scenarios (such as engineering design or uncertainty quantification) by replacing a high fidelity model with a less expensive low-dimensional surrogate.  Similarly, high order accurate schemes are particularly effective at resolving fine-scale features in transient vorticular flows.  Unfortunately, when applied to the equations of fluid dynamics, these numerical methods experience non-physical instabilities which can cause simulations to fail unexpectedly.  The goal of this project is to enable robust and efficient simulations using discretely ""entropy stable"" schemes.  By building fundamental energetic principles directly into a discretization, entropy stable methods retain accuracy while inheriting verifiable properties which improve ""out-of-the-box"" robustness. <br/><br/>Discretely entropy stable high order discretizations for nonlinear conservation laws have seen rapid development over the last 7 years.  This project will extend this methodology to three areas where existing approaches are suboptimal or unavailable: (1) high order methods on non-conforming meshes, (2) high order physical-frame discretizations for domain boundaries with fine-scale features, and (3) reduced order modeling.  Additionally, the PI will integrate aspects of the proposed research with an educational program aimed at promoting computational science and improving retention among college students and K-12 teachers.  Specifically, the PI will (1) design and supervise senior capstone research projects for engineering undergraduates, and (2) organize a summer research program for K-12 teachers centered around numerical modeling and discovery-based learning.

The second aim develops compounds that emit in the near infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum.  Such compounds may be useful for biological sensing and imaging. The third aim targets compounds for photocatalysts in organic synthesis, which is important for the development of new pharmaceuticals. These research directions are complemented by an education and outreach component that aims to improve general chemistry instruction, introduce K-12 students to concepts of photochemistry, and to engage the general public in scientific learning. Professor Teets is creating an online, freely available multimedia general chemistry textbook to benefit low-income students.  He also develops a K-12 lab module titled ""Lighting Up Molecules"" that introduces young students to the interactions of light with chemical compounds. Finally, he produces a public lecture series called ""The Chemistry of Color"" to introduce art enthusiasts to the chemical principles behind the creation of colors in visual art.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Teets studies a new class of blue phosphorescent cyclometalated iridium complexes supported by acyclic diaminocarbene and other unconventional carbene ligands. These carbene moieties destabilize interfering ligand-field states and thereby improve the quantum yield and stability of these blue-emitting compounds. In the opposite extreme of the spectrum, NIR-emitting bis-cyclometalated iridium complexes supported by electron-rich, pi-donating ancillary ligands are prepared. The electron-rich ancillary ligand destabilizes the iridium-centered Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which increases the excited-state metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) character, augments radiative rates, and improves photoluminescence quantum yield. Using similar design elements, potent visible-light photoreductants are developed. These cyclometalated iridium compounds have very reducing excited states and function as photocatalysts for organic transformations that involve photoactivation of strong substrate bonds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participants work in teams of four under the supervision of the PIs. An experienced research mentor and a junior faculty member lead each team. The REU site at LU aims to increase research opportunities for students at institutions where undergraduate research opportunities are limited or nonexistent. By recruiting underrepresented minorities, veterans and community college students, students are empowered to pursue degrees in STEM and to transition to advanced study or careers in STEM. The benefits of participating in a structured research program extend beyond the technical knowledge that students gain. Students increase writing and oral communication skills and are exposed to professional development opportunities in attending conferences to present their work. Furthermore, the faculty advisors continue to serve as mentors for the students beyond the ten weeks of the program. Each year, many students transfer to LU after having completed two-year degrees at local community colleges. The REU site at LU creates an opportunity for participants from local community colleges to meet other STEM students who successfully made the transition to a four-year university. Finally, pairing experienced research mentors with less experienced co-mentors on each research project gives the co-mentors the tools necessary to establish or expand undergraduate research programs.<br/> <br/>The intellectual focus of this program is on interdisciplinary research at the crossroads of mathematics, statistics and computer science. In many applications, dimension reduction is imperative for efficient manipulation of massive quantities of high-dimensional data. Dimension reduction using matrix factorizations and graph theory can be used to ascertain the underlying structure of the data and to find correlations among the data attributes. Interest is increasing in the study of graph theory, singular value decomposition (SVD) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) due to applications in various research areas of mathematics and computer science. SVD and NMF are both unsupervised learning tools currently used in big data analytics.  REU participants will gain exposure to the challenges and opportunities associated with big data. Students are introduced to the three Vs of big data: Volume, Variety, Velocity. Volume refers to the sheer quantity of the data, Variety refers to the different types of data, and Velocity refers to the speed of processing the data.  Students are allotted the opportunity to participate in (1) theoretical research, with students investigating properties of graph theory, SVD and NMF to generate conjectures, prove theorems, and investigate existing algorithms; and (2) programming related research, with students performing experiments on matrix factorizations and graph theory and writing algorithms to process large data sets."

The goal is to explore the fundamental bonding properties of uranium within the fullerene cage with other atoms such as carbon, sulfur, and oxygen.  Fullerenes are chemical compounds composed exclusively of many carbon atoms that are bonded together to form spherical or pseudo-spherical closed structures, that in some cases resemble nano-sized soccer balls.  Fullerenes are essential components in materials applications such as in solar cells and photovoltaics.  The hollow cavities inside these fullerenes offer a unique environment to study isolated chemical systems with unusual structures and bonding motifs as well as interesting electronic properties. The entrapment of metals or metal clusters inside these endohedral fullerenes provides a stable nanocontainer environment.  This enables the study of unique and unusual uranium clusters that will allow for a better fundamental and practical understanding of uranium electronic properties in particular and the actinide series of elements in general.  The project provides an entryway into an essentially new branch of fullerene and actinide science.  A group of students from the University of Texas at El Paso, which is a minority serving institution, are involved in the project.  Given the collaborative nature of the project, they are also exposed to an international research experience.  In addition, several learning modules, targeting middle school, mainly Hispanic science students, are developed.  This new, one month, 20-25 student community outreach program is intended to stimulate their interest in science while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. <br/><br/>In this project, a new series of uranium containing endohedral fullerenes is synthesized, purified and isolated.  It is expected that these carbon caged nanocontainers will allow access to unusual uranium clusters and provide a better fundamental understanding of actinide bonding and chemistry.  Initial results on the isolation and structural characterization of a non-IPR (Isolated Pentagon Rule) uranium endohedral, U@C80, provide incontrovertible support for the uniqueness of these molecules and the feasibility of the approach.  The synthetic methodology is being optimized using different reactor gases, while soot extraction conditions are being tested to maximize the yield. The isolated compounds are being studied through a full battery of techniques that includes X-ray crystallographic analysis, cyclic voltammetry, electronic and vibrational spectroscopy, SQUID magnetic analysis, and theoretical modeling to fully elucidate their structures and properties. Both national and international collaborations are being leveraged to accomplish these critical tasks.

This work seeks to connect ideas in combinatorial optimization and statistical estimation to develop computationally tractable methods for performing structured statistical estimation.<br/><br/>This project provides an integrated program to explore and connect combinatorial optimization and statistical estimation. Modern statistical challenges have become increasingly dependent on understanding both the computational and statistical issues. Many modern statistical estimation problems rely on imposing additional structure in order to reduce the statistical complexity and provide interpretability. Unfortunately, these structures often are combinatorial in nature and result in computationally challenging problems. In parallel, the combinatorial optimization community has placed significant effort in developing algorithms that can approximately solve such optimization problems in a computationally efficient manner. The focus of this project is to expand upon ideas that arise in combinatorial optimization and connect those algorithms and ideas to statistical questions. The research directions of this project are split into three main thrusts unified by the concept of weak submodularity: (a) cardinality constrained optimization and its applications to general statistical optimization problems; (b) matrix estimation problems including low-rank matrix estimation and semi-definite programming problems as well as problems in sparse dictionary learning; and (c) a general theoretical understanding of weak submodularity and specifically analyzing how to develop algorithms in this regime that work well for large-scale datasets."

Laser pulses exceeding tens of gigawatts power can be used in many applications including remote sensing through Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), lightning and weather control and free-space optics communication. Current research on free space optical communications (FSO), both classical and quantum, is intended to facilitate exchange of information within a network of satellites, between the Earth and satellites and between the Earth and drones. This and other aspects to be studied, such as diffraction control, are in line with topics within Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas. In searching for optimal performance, it is critical to seek better understanding of a range of spatial and temporal effects that take place while light interacts with molecules in the atmosphere. For this, proper mathematical and numerical modeling assist experimentalists to for example consider novel modes of propagation (optical filaments versus vortex filaments) and the possible coexistence of multi- color (multi-frequency) filaments. Research performed under this award will have a strong synergy with experimental groups, enriching the interdisciplinary nature of the project and enhancing the learning experience of applied mathematics graduate students to be trained in a multifaceted approach.<br/><br/>Under the general theme of light matter interactions, the PI and students will investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of light propagation in nonlinear media. The research addresses well defined questions related to the characterization of highly nonlinear optical modes of different types  (filament modes, vortex modes and combinations) in three different media: air (Kerr media), carrying two frequencies (typically ultraviolet and infrared), nonlinear crystals (quadratic media) where little is known on the theory of filament formation at phase mismatch  and on the formation of filaments in discrete/continuum nonlinear media with fractional diffraction and quadratic dispersion. The first two topics represent significant extensions of ongoing research in filament science, based either on recent experimental observations or potential new experiments on which the PI has been and will be directly involved.

The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and materials chemistry, and is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Undergraduates and graduate students in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will have opportunities to collaborate with experts from chemistry, engineering, and physics. Professor Todd Hudnall is also well poised to increase the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as Texas State University is one of the largest Hispanic Serving Institutes in Texas.  Professor Hudnall works with members of local high schools and children's museums to design science curricula dedicated to providing problem-based learning experiences through hands-on experimentation in the chemical and physical sciences. Members of Professor Todd Hudnall's research team and local high school students design and implement experiments that mimic the experiences of collegiate level researchers in order to encourage the high school students to pursue science degrees in college.  <br/><br/>The unique electronic configuration of stable organic radicals circumvents classical quantum mechanical limitations such as the Pauli Exclusion Principle, making these molecules good candidates for next generation energy/memory storage and organic light-emitting diode materials. The radical motifs are derived from singlet carbenes or carbene-inspired moieties that enables the rapid tailoring of the electrochemical and/or photophysical properties of the resultant organic radicals.  This strategy allows the synthesis of novel organic radical architectures to develop a dynamic structure-property correlation. These studies answer the following questions: 1) How do the electronic properties of the carbene influence the electrochemical and/or photophysical properties of the radical? 2) To what extent can the electrochemical window be expanded for these systems? 3) Will neutral radicals obtained by reduction of emissive cations likewise be emissive?

Indeed, lithium-based batteries have become the power source of choice in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Still, commercial batteries utilize materials with relatively low energy densities; they add substantial weight to vehicles and occupy huge volumes in portable electronics but must be re-charged every few hours. Owing to their enormous energy densities, batteries 'beyond lithium-ion' based on metallic lithium and sodium have emerged, primed to meet growing demands. However, these systems suffer from severe issues of degradation and safety that have precluded their practical use. Materials and mechanics-based studies are thus necessary to enable safe and durable operation. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to provide understanding of the interplay between functional and structural behavior of lithium and sodium metal anodes, combined with materials discovery of alloys. These studies will guide appropriate charging conditions, applied pressures, and material properties that prevent damage. Overall, advances in batteries will benefit the USA by reducing harmful emissions, improving safety, enhancing infrastructure, and securing energy independence. Commercializing lithium anodes would dramatically increase energy densities (up to ~4x) of portable electronics and electric vehicles, while commercializing sodium anodes may enable grid-scale storage of renewable energy. The broader objectives of this proposal include leveraging established programs to provide research experiences for military veterans and underrepresented minorities. The project will also develop immersive augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) learning modules to enhance students? understanding of the interplay among mechanics, microstructure, chemistry, and electric fields in materials for energy storage and conversion. Outreach activities will involve K-12 students and teachers to increase awareness of clean energy technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>While the electrochemistry of lithium and sodium has received extensive study, at the heart of the issues outlined above lies a mechanics of materials problem: unstable deformation occurs during operation, producing dendrites and damage. Complicating this matter is that due to their extreme chemical reactivity in air, relatively little is known regarding even the basic mechanical properties of lithium and sodium, e.g., sodium?s room temperature plastic properties and deformation mechanisms remain largely unknown. Even less is known regarding stresses developed during electrodeposition, time/temperature-dependent behavior, fracture and fatigue behavior, how alloys modify properties, and their corresponding influence on microstructural stability. This project will fill in these gaps in fundamental knowledge through testing the following hypotheses: (1) time-dependent plastic deformation dominates the mechanical behavior of lithium and sodium metal; (2) specific alloys enhance creep resistance, promoting structural stability; (3) stresses develop during electrodeposition that can damage surrounding layers and the metals themselves; and (4) pre-loads applied to electrode stacks promote microstructurally stable deposition. To test these hypotheses, this project will utilize unique experimental facilities and develop theoretical models to connect the evolution of mechanical properties, stress, and deformation to chemical and microstructural changes during electrochemical cycling. From the educational perspective of this proposal, textbooks seldom cover coupled phenomena in electro-chemo-mechanics. This project will develop AR/VR modules to fill these voids, which will be integrated into undergraduate/graduate curricula, shown at K-12 outreach activities, shared with K-12 teachers, and made available online. This project will also enable students in materials and mechanics to work in areas not conventionally open to the discipline (electrochemistry) to encourage interdisciplinary research careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's outcomes will help to mitigate a major crisis that is imminent if lithium ion batteries (LIBs) displace the fossil fuels in automotive and stationary energy storage applications. Mined supplies of the lithium carbonate precursor are limited in availability, so large-scale deployment of LIBs in electric vehicles and electric grids may lead to major lithium shortages. Akin to the well-known ""Oil Shocks"" of the past, a precursor shortage could lead to a series of lithium price shocks, threatening to derail the entire electric vehicle movement. Unlike lithium, sodium is both easy to find and is inexpensive, with wide supplies of precursors available on land and from salt water through desalination. Importantly, this GOALI research project will result in new engineering and scientific knowledge essential to Graphenix Development Inc.'s efforts to pursue their ""next-generation"" battery development strategy. Such effort will help U.S.-based company (headquarters in Buffalo NY, manufacturing in Rochester NY) towards becoming a global green energy storage leader. The graduate students supported through this project should find post-graduate work in a number of emerging U.S. renewable energy industries, such as in electric vehicles. This research is providing opportunities for U.S. Military Veterans and local high-school students to engage in both academic and industrial learning activities. Also, this project involves direct interactions with staff at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and at Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This combined experimental-modeling effort addresses the core of the structure-properties relationships in energy storing materials. The project will elucidate the fundamental questions regarding how sodium is stored and transported at various states of charge in ""beyond lithium"" systems, such as in selenium - carbon nanocomposite battery cathodes. Many of the existing ""lithium-inherited"" paradigms will be done away with, leading to the transformative, new understanding of sodiation electrochemical reactions. This study provides an opportunity to broaden understanding of the rich array of possible complex solid-state phenomena in energy storage materials. The effort combines electroanalytical and structural characterization methods with atomic level simulation. Advanced techniques are being employed, including site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface spectroscopy of the electrodes at various voltages, cycle numbers, and states of degradation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Depression is the leading mental health comorbidity of HIV infection and may trigger negative consequences such as poor adherence to ART, more rapid HIV disease progression, and engagement in risky behaviors.  Since ART is recommended for all HIV patients and must be continued indefinitely, minimizing the adverse effects of ART has garnered increasing attention.  Due to the rapid generation of drug-resistant mutations, modern ART typically combines three or four ART drugs of different mechanisms or against different targets.  Understanding the effects of a single ART drug or combinations of ART drugs can help physicians better manage patients' depression, guide treatment changes if needed, and facilitate individualized treatment.  This project aims to fill a critical gap in the availability of appropriate statistical models to systematically investigate the effects of ART on depression.  Recent technological advances in the biomedical field have led to rapid accumulation of health- and disease-related data,  which provide researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to make reliable and efficient inference from these complex and heterogeneous datasets using novel statistical models.  This project will use data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a prospective, observational, multi-center study which includes more than 4,000 women living with HIV or at risk for HIV infection in the United States.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop novel Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models to estimate the effects of ART based on patients'  longitudinal medication data and depression outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors.  Specifically, a new Bayesian longitudinal graphical model will be developed with nodes representing drugs and depression items, and weighted edges representing the strength of the drug-depression relationships, which may vary across different clinical visits and different patients.  In addition, a novel Bayesian framework that incorporates the similarity between different drug combinations as well as accounts for patients' treatment histories will be developed to learn arbitrary drug combination effects.  The proposed work will bridge the gap between the experience/knowledge acquired during basic research and day-to-day practice by facilitating the understanding of the adverse effects of individual drugs, guiding more informed and effective treatment regimen selection, and eventually helping to reduce the healthcare resource burden. The proposed models can be easily generalized to learn other ART-related complications such as cognitive impairment, and may also be used in a wide range of applications across multiple biomedical fields and beyond, such as electronic health record data analysis for chronic conditions, study of combination therapy for cancer treatment, and injury prevention in sports medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The peculiar properties of quantum mechanics enable fundamentally new computing, cryptographic, and communication methods that far outpace their classical counterparts. Harnessing these properties for technology requires the ability to control and manipulate complex physical systems while preserving their delicate quantum structure. To date, quantum technologies have only been successfully implemented in very small systems for which every detail can be completely characterized and controlled, presenting a barrier to large scale implementation. In contrast, macroscopic quantum materials exhibit remarkable universal phenomena, e.g. superconductivity and magnetism, that are insensitive to the underlying minutiae. However, these complex quantum systems often have too many moving parts to precisely control, typically leading to rapid scrambling of encoded information before it can be utilized.<br/><br/>This project aims to bridge the gap between these two regimes by identifying robust, error-resistant ways to control quantum motion in macroscopic systems, without separately controlling each individual piece. This will be done by exploring new realms of matter in isolated quantum systems that are cut off from the outside world, but are driven far from conventional equilibrium settings using, for example, irradiation by modulated light. The research will build new theoretical and computational tools for simulating the dynamics of complex quantum systems, and develop universal organizing principles to understand their properties. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will play an integral role in the research efforts, while building towards their degrees.

Universality is typically elusive in complicated many-body systems, as their chaotic internal dynamics rapidly lead towards thermal equilibrium producing incoherent classical dynamics. This project seeks to find intrinsically quantum coherent dynamical steady states that defy the ""laws"" of thermal equilibrium, and consists of three thrusts:<br/><br/>1) Isolating a system from its environment, and adding strong disorder can indefinitely prevent thermalization and lead to the phenomena of many-body localization. The PI will investigate how equilibrium thermodynamics breaks down sharply at the onset of localization by developing new numerical renormalization group techniques and analytic methods based on tensor-network methods to describe this new class of critical phenomena.<br/><br/>2) Driving a quantum system in a time-dependent fashion can achieve nonequilibrium steady states. The PI will explore how new dynamical topological phases with no equilibrium analog can be engineered by driving.<br/><br/>3) The PI will investigate how non-thermal states and quantum dynamics can be used to build entangled light sources, to access new nonequilibrium phases in dissipative systems, and to devise new ways to dynamically probe the properties of equilibrium quantum materials.<br/><br/>These directions are inspired by rapid experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical systems that can be well isolated from their environment and can be dynamically manipulated with great precision and flexibility. The proposed research can enable novel dynamical macroscopic quantum phenomena in these systems without the need for stringent cooling, offering strong advantages for their experimental exploration. Applications of these ideas to solid-state systems and new computational methods will also be developed.<br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will play an integral role in the research efforts, while building towards their degrees.

Although the black hole's gravitational influence is limited to a very small region at the center of the galaxy, surprisingly the black hole mass has been found to strongly correlate with the properties of the larger host galaxy. This suggests that black holes are essential components of galaxies, with the growth of one somehow affecting the growth of the other. Our understanding of the underlying physics, however, is limited by the current sample of galaxies. In particular, black hole mass determinations have been made in galaxies that are not representative of the global population. Our program seeks to address this troublesome bias by measuring black hole masses in 31 local galaxies using state-of-the-art observational and dynamical modeling methods. The proposed research will yield the largest uniform black hole survey carried out to date. By specifically targeting galaxies with sizes and luminosities that are not well represented in the existing sample, the PI will obtain a more complete census of local black holes in a wider range of galaxies. Forgoing the approach that has been used for years of measuring a few black holes at a time, and instead examining large, homogenous datasets of carefully selected samples is the ideal way to achieve a breakthrough in our understanding of how black holes and galaxies grow and evolve together.<br/><br/>The project also incorporates an educational component, reaching a potentially large number of people who may never opt to attend a science event on their own.

About 100 black hole mass measurements in nearby galaxies have been made to date, leading to the establishment of tight correlations between the mass of a central black hole and its host galaxy's large-scale properties. Our understanding of the underlying physics driving the empirical relations, however, is limited by the current sample of galaxies. In particular, black hole mass determinations have been made in galaxies that are not representative of the global population. Instead, galaxies with small sizes at a given luminosity have been preferentially targeted, as they are generally the easiest to observe and model. The project seeks to address this troublesome bias by weighing black holes in 31 local galaxies using adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini North telescope, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, wide-field integral field spectroscopy from McDonald Observatory, and state-of-the-art dynamical models. The proposed research will yield the largest uniform black hole survey carried out to date, and will significantly enhance the diversity of black hole hosts by targeting galaxies with sizes and luminosities that are not well represented in the existing sample. This benchmark study will produce a more complete census of black holes in a wide range of galaxies that have experienced diverse evolutionary pasts, and will provide a deeper understanding of black hole-galaxy co-evolution. Detailed investigations of large, carefully selected samples using a homogenous approach is the ideal way to make major progress in the field prior to the next generation of extremely large telescopes.<br/><br/>The program also incorporates an educational component, reaching a potentially large number of people who may never opt to attend a science event on their own.

Practical realization of such applications of block copolymer materials typically require that they form geometrically ordered structures, such as cylindrical or lamellar (sheet-like) microstructure and more complex geometries. While block copolymers can form these ordered structures intrinsically by self-assembly at molecular scales, obtaining ordered structures over macroscopic scales useful for applications requires providing the block copolymer with sufficient molecular mobility via processing methods. Thermal and solvent vapor processing methods are currently used, however, they can be slow and often not possible due to concerns of thermal degradation.  The research here develops and examines in-depth a rapid processing approach that involves immersing the block copolymer into multi-component solvent mixtures that offer a controllable balance of swelling, non-swelling and block-interactions-tunable solvents.  A successful research will pave the way for continuous roll-to-roll industrial processing for large-scale self-assembly of block copolymer structures for various applications. The research will promote participation of women and minorities through several educational and outreach activities, develop a polymer nanotechnology course with a laboratory module for Chemical Engineering and Materials Science graduate students, and engage high school students in laboratory research with internship programs.    <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Block copolymers consist of chemically bonded monomer sequences whose ability to self-assemble renders them applicable for various potential nanotechnology applications, ranging from nanophotonics to nanoelectronics to nano-porous membranes. To accomplish these ordered self-assembly-driven microstructures requires advanced processing methods for  controlled morphology and long-range order with minimal defects over macroscopic scales. While thermal and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) are established methods of block copolymer ordering, the work here will enable ordering of block copolymers annealed by a newly developed method involving its immersion in a mixture of solvents, while at the same time elucidating molecular-level understanding of the resulting morphology. Termed Direct Immersion Annealing, or DIA, the method has already demonstrated promise for rapid ordering of 2D cylinder-forming block copolymer films with unique control over domain spacing. The present work will examine DIA induced ordering of block copolymer films to study 1) chemical-potential controlled partitioning of solvent mixture within BCP blocks and activation energy of ordering, 2) role of intrinsic block copolymer morphology (1D, 2D, and 3D) on domain collapse in dry state, 3) ionic-liquid as a processing aid for enhanced ordering and targeted transport of functional nanoparticles selectively within BCP block domains, 4) fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic differences between DIA and SVA, and 5) effect of substrate surface energy on DIA-induced orientation and morphology of BCP films. Workforce aspects will involve the training of women and minorities through several educational and outreach activities, developing a bridging undergraduate-to-graduate polymer nanotechnology course, and provide scientific internships to high school students to learn about polymers, from a basic to an advanced level. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, this phase of strongly interacting matter can be re-created under extreme conditions of temperatures or densities, like the ones achieved in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions currently taking place at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This project will support the experimental programs at RHIC and LHC by calculating observables from first principles and relating them to measurements. The purpose is to advance the understanding of strong interactions by answering unresolved questions related to the nature of the phase transition and the degrees of freedom, which populate the system in the different regions of the phase diagram. The high precision achievable currently in the theoretical calculations allows such a combined effort between theory and experiment for the first time. This project will help train the next generation of students working on the theory of fundamental interactions, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students will be exposed to an international environment and will learn the most advanced theoretical tools. The PI will promote physics to underrepresented minorities through public lectures, seminars and visits to Houston schools.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to achieve a microscopic understanding of Quark-Gluon Plasma properties. The project will help determine the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, the degrees of freedom which populate its different regions, the evolution of the system through the QCD crossover transition and its thermodynamic properties in the deconfined phase. The methodology is to calculate relevant observables using numerical simulations from first principles and map them to measurements through phenomenological models. The specific objectives are as follows: determine the temperatures and densities in the QCD phase diagram at which hadrons are formed and relate them to the ones measured in experiment; constrain the existence and position of the critical point, at which the order of the phase transition changes;  establish whether the interaction is strong enough to enable sequential, possibly flavor specific, hadron formation in the QGP. With its zero and finite-density components, the project will yield a coherent theoretical framework for the RHIC and LHC programs from first principles. Besides having immediate applications to heavy ion collisions, the project is expected to have a broader impact on other fields of physics, such as string theory, cosmology and condensed matter."

Mosquitoes are the most widely distributed disease vectors and are a serious threat to human life and health. West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the mosquito-borne diseases for which there is still no effective treatment; to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported over 40,000 cases across the United States. Temperature and precipitation are the two most important weather variables that affect mosquito populations and thus affect the WNV transmission cycle.  The mosquito infection rate (MIR) is considered an important mediator to study WNV risk. Based on surveillance data for WNV in Illinois, this project aims to develop new methodologies and algorithms to study WNV and MIR using weather and environmental variables. Specifically, the investigators plan first to make predictions of MIR and then characterize the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation to identify the risk level of WNV human illness and MIR. They will also establish a WNV Index to provide a reliable and interpretable warning for vector-borne disease risk. Finally, since mosquito-borne diseases are particularly affected by rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and a higher frequency of extreme weather events, the project aims to both quantitatively and qualitatively project the current risk to the future under climate change. The research will foster fundamental statistical methodology development as well as collaborations between statistics and public health. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in aspects of the scientific research. The project will provide new results on the impact of climate change on national security, of general interest and importance to the wider public and policymakers.<br/><br/>The methods of this project include a spatially-varying-coefficient model with functional weather covariates to make predictions of MIR, as well as a multiple-testing approach to characterize the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation for ultimately classifying the weather pattern into different risk levels with respect to WNV. The statistical models and algorithms learned from the historical data will be applied to downscaled future weather data to study the impact of climate change on WNV human illness and MIR. The analyses will be based on massive data including WNV human cases, MIR, current and future spatio-temporal stochastic weather processes, land cover, and the length of daylight. The statistical methods used in the project are not only effective for this WNV study but can be a general methodology for a wide range of vector-borne diseases. The spatially-varying-coefficient model with functional covariates takes the continuous and dynamic influence of the retrospective weather on MIR into account while allowing the relationship between MIR and weather and other environmental variables to vary over a spatial domain. The characterization of the spatial weather pattern and the establishment of WNV Index provide a new perspective to study and prevent WNV risk. Compared to previous methods that evaluate the difference between two spatio-temporal random fields as a whole, the multiple-testing approach in this project can detect exactly where the differences occur. This feature is crucial for regional risk detection. Quantifying the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases is essential to policymakers; the results of the project are expected to provide a reliable resource for such purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will provide new scientific insight and a novel approach for designing optical devices that are immune to the possible fabrication errors or small damages in the devices that can occur under severe conditions.

In stationary optical systems, they will design one-dimensional optical lattices with robust exceptional points with application in robust sensing while in spatiotemporally modulated lattices they propose a new application of exceptional points in robust optical devices capable of generating higher harmonics in the presence of disorder.

A fundamental challenge for the chemical sciences is to bridge the gap between the ability to study and manipulate matter at the atomistic scale with the desire to understand and predict properties at a macroscopic scale. Recently, there has been an immense increase in high-throughput and high-resolution technologies for experimental observation. In addition there is an increase in high-performance techniques to simulate molecular systems at a microscopic level. These advances have resulted in a vast and ever-increasing amounts of high-dimensional data. Consequently, there is a recent surge of interest in data analysis techniques. In particular, techniques that extract essential features, collective variables or representative states from simulations. These simulation data have to be reconciles with experimental data. However, with very few exceptions, these reconciling techniques are purely descriptive and do not allow the formulation of general principles regulating the macroscopic behavior. Furthermore it is difficult to scale up towards significantly larger and more complex systems. This project develops a new and general approach to address this challenge. The approaches are applicable to very different chemical systems, ranging from signal transduction in cells, over heterogeneous catalysis to the design of polymer brushes. The proposed research impacts a large interdisciplinary community of students and researchers in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. The project undertakes curriculum development in computational and mathematical methods applied to chemical systems. Curriculum development includes undergraduate and graduate courses. The project is also recruiting and mentoring women and minority undergraduate and graduate students. This activity is conducted through a collaboration with the Tapia Center at Rice University.<br/><br/>The project is developing a general framework to obtain the effective dynamical models (structure, equations and parameters) governing molecular systems. The key hypothesis is that, in order to be able to understand and model macroscopic systems, there is a need to use purely descriptive models to define generative models from data. Models are developed at the mesoscale from microscale simulations and multiscale experimental data. The approach is fundamentally different from available coarse-graining techniques or model reduction methods. Both the form of the macroscopic model as well as the effective dynamical equations are learned from data. Functional building blocks that can be embedded in higher order simulations are generated in order to bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic systems. The method investigates if and how relatively general organizing principles emerge from the interactions of a multitude of atomic degrees of freedoms in different chemical systems. This modeling approach has the potential to serve as a keystone to integrate vast amounts of chemical data into quantitative, mechanistic and comprehensible models. Such models are able to explain how different molecular components organize and interact as a function of time and space in performing functions at the macroscopic scale."

Chemical catalysis is used to produce many commodity chemicals in the pharmaceutical, construction, communication and food industries and thus, is a fundamental economic driver for the U.S. economy. However, many of the most importance catalytic transformations rely on expensive and rare metal elements.  These rare metals currently provide a critical need in catalytic chemistry. To meet this challenge, new catalysts based on less toxic and earth abundant elements are being designed and synthesized as replacements for the precious metal elements currently in use.  An outreach program developed by Professor Findlater involves the development of traveling Labs which focus on catalysis. The labs are designed for portability to allow transport to rural area high schools; allowing the students the means to learn about catalysis. <br/><br/>This project focuses on new environmentally benign catalysts based on diimine complexes of iron, as well as the study of the varied mechanisms at play in iron catalysis.

The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant metals and new insight into the reaction chemistry of first-row transition metals."

In some materials with particular structures, a current of charge in one direction can drive a current of spin in a transverse direction (the ""spin Hall effect""), and a net imbalance of spin can build up at the material's surface.  In other materials (two-dimensional ""topological insulators""), charge and spin are predicted to flow only around the perimeter of the material.  In both systems, because charge and spin come in discrete amounts and are coupled together, a lot can be learned about how they move by measuring not just the charge current, but fluctuations in the charge current called ""shot noise"".  This project measures the shot noise at radio frequencies produced by current flow along the edges of 2d topological insulators, to determine the nature of that edge transport and the scattering mechanisms that limit its flow.  This information is revealed by the geometry, temperature, and magnetic field dependence of the noise.  This project applies the same measurement approach to look for shot noise predicted to result when the spin Hall effect builds up spin polarization at a material surface.  This is one avenue to determine the amount of spin build-up without the need for complicated device structures involving magnetic materials. This project provides research training and professional development for two graduate students, as well as research opportunities for undergraduates.  Results are disseminated through publications, presentations at conferences and universities, and through the principal investigator's blog.  The principal investigator is working with K12 teachers and undergraduates to explain this and related research at level appropriate for a general audience, in writings distributed in the blog and in cooperation with the Houston Chronicle.  The principal investigator is also developing resources for science writers and journalists, to aid in explaining condensed matter and nanoscale physics concepts to the public.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>There is a growing appreciation that the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom of electrons provides opportunities to manipulate spin and create previously unprecedented electronic systems.  The intellectual merit of this effort focuses on understanding two physical systems.  In particular materials, band structure predicts the formation of a two-dimensional ""topological insulator"" state in the bulk, with topologically protected, 1d helical edge states girding the perimeter.  Understanding these edge states is essential for realizing their benefits in dissipationless transport and computing.    Electron-electron interactions, magnetic impurities, and disorder are expected to affect these edge states in ways testable through measurements of nonequilibrium noise in the edge state conduction.  In addition, the related spin Hall effect is a viable means of generating nonequilibrium spin accumulation in metals, with tremendous potential for information storage and processing.  Charge noise is predicted to be a way to characterize that spin accumulation without the need for ferromagnetic materials.  This project measures nonequilibrium noise and charge transport to examine edge states at 2d TI interfaces and SHE-driven spin accumulation in metal nanostructures.  Specific scientific questions include:  Are edge states at semiconductor heterointerfaces trivial or topological?  What limits ballistic transport in such edge states?  To what extent does spin accumulation from the spin Hall effect produce charge current noise?  These science questions have relevance for technological applications, including exotic computational architectures and magnetic information storage and processing.  Beyond technologies, the broader impacts of this project involve the professional training of graduate students and undergraduates as the next generation of technological workforce, and public outreach including K12 education.  The principal investigator works with Rice K12 programs and an ongoing Rice REU program focusing on Houston-area community college students; and public outreach based on his decade-established blog.  Specific products include a primer/guide to condensed matter/nano physics for science journalists; ""tip-sheets"" to science journalists regarding new developments in the field; and science writing contributions for the Houston Chronicle."

These are abstract mathematical objects designed to model the universe we live in.  The term locally homogeneous refers to the presence of a high degree of local symmetry which is captured by a Lie group called the (local) symmetry group.  It is this symmetry group which governs the geometry, in the following sense: the meaningful quantities we can measure in a geometric manifold (e.g. lengths or angles) are exactly those which are invariant under the symmetry group.  There are many different possible symmetry groups which lead to different types of geometric manifolds useful in many contexts across mathematics and physics.  There can also be many different geometric manifolds with the same local symmetry group. These all have the same local properties, but can look very different at large scales. The space of all such possibilities is called a moduli space; it is a topological space whose points are the possible geometric manifolds of a certain type and whose topology organizes those geometric manifolds into families whose features vary continuously. While the precise features (e.g. shape, size, etc.) of our universe is a question for empirical physics, a moduli space is the mathematical answer to the question of what possible features could the universe have.  The research component of this project studies geometric manifolds of many types, with focus on flat affine geometry, real projective geometry, and constant curvature pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These geometries have just the right amount of symmetry to allow for large interesting moduli spaces with mysterious but tractable behavior. Core elements of the educational component include training Ph.D. students, a new Texas Experimental Geometry Lab for undergraduate research, and the Texas Winter Workshop on Geometric Structures for early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in the PI's research program is that geometric manifolds of one type may be fruitfully studied by deforming, or transitioning, to a different type of geometry.  For example, the PI?s work studying Margulis spacetimes as geometric limits of anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, has yielded many results about the geometry, topology, and deformation theory of these affine Lorentzian three-manifolds. The PI will develop new tools, following the geometric limit point of view, for new affine geometry contexts in higher dimensions, in order to address questions surrounding important open problems such as the Auslander Conjecture. The PI will also pursue a broad program to study convex real projective structures on manifolds. One focus is to identify which three-manifolds admit such structures and to describe the moduli spaces, with applications to questions in low-dimensional topology. In a more general context, the PI will conduct a thorough investigation of a new notion of convex cocompactness in real projective geometry, generalizing the well-studied notion from the Kleinian groups setting. Educational goals of this project center on expanding and vertically integrating the research training program in Geometric Structures at UT Austin being developed by the PI. The Texas Experimental Geometry Lab (TXGL) will introduce undergraduates at UT Austin to research in geometry, topology, and/or dynamics through computational and experimental projects. TXGL will also provide opportunities for Ph.D. students and post-docs to gain experience mentoring and teaching undergraduates outside the traditional classroom setting. In addition, TXGL will produce visualizations that illustrate concepts from current mathematics research. The Texas Winter Workshops in Geometric Structures will bring together small groups of early career mathematicians in order to learn an emerging new topic at the intersection of different (but related) mathematical fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, this research utilizes diverse and multi-pronged approaches in achieving this mission. These include studying the extensions to the Standard Model which governs the behavior of the elementary particles, and the associated experimental signatures of such extensions.   These also include the study of early-universe cosmology and present-day astrophysics, and the exploration of the physics of black holes which may shed light on how a quantum theory of gravity may be formulated.   Finally, these also include studies in relativistic quantum field theory (which is the mathematical language in which theories of the elementary particles are expressed) as well as string theory (which aims to unify all of the different particles and forces in nature).  Since the early days of modern physics, the United States has led the effort in the discovery of these fundamental laws.   Further research in this direction is therefore in the national interest, and Professors Distler, Fischler, Kilic, Paban, and Weinberg are committed to making further research contributions in these directions.  In addition, this research will involve graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and thereby provide scientific training that should serve these junior scientists well throughout their careers both within and outside of academia.

Professor Distler will continue his exploration of 4D N=2 superconformal field theories and their properties, including the relation to 2D Vertex Operator Algebras. He will extend some of the lessons learned to N=1 SCFTs and he will visit afresh certain aspects of the theory of orientifolds.  Professor Fischler will continue to work with his students on quantum information in quantum gravity (using gauge-gravity duality) and the use of the quantum Hall effect in the context of quantum computation. Professor Fischler and his students are also involved in discovering possibly new observable effects in jet emissions by black holes using the gauge-gravity connection.  Professor Kilic will continue to work on dark-matter models that have uncommon experimental signatures or that can address open questions related to astrophysical observations;  he will also study techniques in collider searches designed to improve sensitivity in the case of low signal statistics and exotic final states, and he will explore how the solution to the naturalness puzzle can be experimentally probed. Professor Paban will continue to work on early-universe physics. She will explore the robustness of inflation in multifield models and the experimental signatures of models of multifield inflation compatible with string theory.

The life of cells depends on their response to their environment.  Cells need to get information about the environment and react to it.  The communication of this information takes place through the cell membrane by what are called signaling processes.  These signaling processes are aided by a specialized set of proteins that bind calcium.  Many aspects of the calcium-mediated protein binding to membranes remain unknown.  The research experiments focus on the understanding the structure and dynamics of a class of these proteins, namely C2 domains, by an innovative experimental approach that takes advantage of the binding of unnatural (non-native) metal ions to the protein.  The objective of the research is to obtain insight into the fundamental biological chemistry and biophysics of the interactions between the protein and metal ions and between the protein and membrane because these interactions determine the transmission of information into the cell.  Professor Igumenova organizes a 2-day summer workshop for high-school students from under-represented and under-privileged groups through an educational partnership with a Title 1 high school in which student population is more than 90% minority and 64% qualifies as economically disadvantaged.  During this experience, the high school students learn through lectures, use of Wikipedia webpages constructed by Dr. Igumenova and her students, and hands-on activities about the important role of metal ions in biology as well as about the toxicity of some metal ions.  <br/> <br/>This project is focused on C2 domains, a class of Ca2+-dependent peripheral membrane proteins.  The C2 domains chosen for this study belong to two proteins that are of paramount importance in human biology, Protein Kinase C and Synaptotagmin I.  The experimental approach, which integrates NMR and EPR spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations, is applied to the complexes of C2 domains with xenobiotic (i.e. non-native) metal ions to investigate the conformational preferences of the Ca2+-sensing region of Synaptotagmin I, the role of protein dynamics in C2 interactions with metal ions, and the structural basis of the metal-ion dependent recruitment of C2 domains to lipid membranes.  The impact of the proposed work goes beyond the two protein systems under study because the C2 domains are found in more than 100 signaling proteins.  In addition to uncovering the mechanisms of signal transduction, information from this study provides new insight into the biological chemistry of xenobiotic metal ions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most extreme predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes, compact objects whose gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from them. Investigating gravity in such an extreme regime provides one of the most promising opportunities to learn more about this fundamental force. Another prediction of general relativity, that binary black holes emit gravitational waves that stretch and squeeze spacetime, was recently confirmed by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).  Black holes are fully described by their masses and spins, but the spins of binary black holes are generally misaligned with their orbital plane, much like the 23 degree misalignment between the Earth's rotation axis and its orbit about the Sun responsible for the seasons. General relativity causes black-hole spins to change direction or precess; this precession leaves detectable signatures in the gravitational waves observed by LIGO. This award supports studies on black-hole spin precession and the extent to which it can be constrained by gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO. This work helps scientists to interpret LIGO observations and thus better understand gravity and the astrophysical origin of black holes responsible for their spin misalignments. The PI and collaborators will also develop an interactive virtual-reality simulation of precessing black holes and the gravitational waves they emit which will be available free online and presented at local public libraries and museums through existing outreach networks of the University of Texas at Dallas. These simulations help the public virtually experience the effects of gravitational waves and enhance public interest and support for science research and education.<br/><br/>This goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the origin and implications of misalignments between binary black-hole spins and their orbital angular momentum. Population-synthesis codes will be used to explore how initial spin misalignments depend on various aspects of astrophysical black-hole formation like mass transfer, tidal alignment, and supernova recoils. The spin distributions generated by these codes will be evolved from black-hole formation until they begin to emit detectable gravitational waves using the PI's newly developed technique for efficiently calculating spin precession on the inspiral timescale. Once the binaries enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors like LIGO, publicly available codes in the LIGO Algorithm Library Suite will be used to generate waveforms and analyze how well the binary black-hole parameters that determine spin precession can be estimated for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. The PI and collaborators will also perform and analyze numerical-relativity simulations to assess the reliability of post-Newtonian predictions for spin precession in the final orbits before black-hole merger. This research provides the basis for astrophysical model selection, combining constraints on spin misalignments from many events to distinguish astrophysical models of black-hole formation, such as dynamical formation in a globular cluster (for which spins should be isotropic) versus formation from stellar binaries (which should exhibit a tendency towards aligned spins). The final project will consider how spin precession between black hole formation and merger affects predictions for final black-hole masses, spins, and gravitational recoils.  This project has implications both for the stellar-mass black holes observed by LIGO and recoiling quasars spatially or kinematically offset from their host galaxies sought in galaxy surveys."

In nature, proteins are built from 22 amino acids and they adopt structures that have diverse functions. If proteins could adopt structures unknown in natural biological systems, they may display new functions or new self-assembling properties. However, the synthesis of new man-made proteins remains challenging. The project focuses on the synthesis of new starting materials that can control the man-made protein structure, and thus function. The synthetic methods produce new, general solutions for understanding protein structure thus, the project falls under the NSF Big Idea Understanding the Rules of Life. The project integrates outreach efforts to high school students and teachers. Both groups learn about, and participate in, chemical research in the Ball laboratories. The teachers are also given the opportunity to develop new teaching tools that incorporate chemical research and discovery and thus, ensure the broad dissemination of the value and excitement of modern chemical research to young students.<br/><br/>The selective chemical manipulation of proteins remains challenging. This project combines transition-metal catalysts with boronic acid reagents of diverse structure and reactivity to develop a suite of methods for the photo-controlled capture, manipulation, and regulation of natural proteins. Variation of the structure of both the metal catalyst and the boronic acid is a powerful synthetic tool that allows the development of diverse and complementary bioconjugation methods. The research exploits the unique and remarkable reactivity of pyroglutamate, which is a naturally-occurring and readily-encoded posttranslational modification of the N-terminus of some proteins, in metal-catalyzed reactions with boronic acid reagents.  These studies develop fundamental concepts for single-step construction of complex protein conjugates and for testing new and useful selectivity paradigms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analyzing patterns of prior terror events is one of the primary ways researchers can learn about terrorism and its determinants, thereby enabling governments to craft more effective counter-terrorism policy in the future. Yet, most statistical models used by researchers are ill-suited to capture the complex dynamics of global terrorism. For example, it is known that acts of terrorism often produce subsequent acts of terror. However, current understanding of the evolution of terror campaigns remains limited and constrained by methods which either assume independence across events or lack sufficiently flexible models of dependence. In this project, the PIs plan to generalize these statistical approaches to make them better suited for the analysis of global terrorism, and to help identify more complex interactions within and across terror campaigns.  The results of this project will ultimately benefit policy makers and aid government efforts to curb such violence. The PIs will author popular summaries of the project results for general audiences, and integrate the proposed research with education through training graduate students and developing courses.    <br/><br/>This multidisciplinary project aims to develop spatio-temporal Hawkes process models on a global scale with flexible nonstationary spatio-temporal intensity functions. Current Hawkes process models found in the literature are often univariate, defined only on the planar domain, and do not permit spatio-temporal interactions. The PIs will develop Hawkes process models defined on the surface of a sphere with a flexible spatio-temporal structure in the triggering function. Specific developments will include spatio-temporal nonstationarity, non-separability, and asymmetry. Multivariate extensions of the proposed models will be pursued to simultaneously model varied attack types or attacks by multiple terrorist groups. Statistical inference with numerical computation of the likelihood for massive global data, and procedures for hypothesis tests of spatio-temporal structures in point pattern data will be studied. Proposed methods will be applied to the analysis of individual terrorist groups in single countries, as well as global terrorism patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reduction in size of magnetic particles over the past several decades has led to significant increase in the storage capacity but the limit is being reached.  Professor Dunbar's group at Texas A&M University Main Campus explores new types of chemical structures that display magnetic behavior at the nanoscale level.  Through systematic investigation of the structure-property relationships of these magnetic compounds, the team aims to gain a better fundamental understanding of the factors that contribute to superior magnetic properties and provide insight to inform design of the next generation magnets for computing or electronic storage devices.  The versatility of skills required to work on this project is an excellent opportunity for students, including members of underrepresented groups, to learn chemical synthesis as well as numerous methods of characterization. <br/><br/>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports Prof. Dunbar's group to synthesize and study the properties of multinuclear transition and lanthanide metal supramolecular architectures with neutral and radical bridging ligands.  Whereas more commonly used closed-shell (diamagnetic) bridging ligands engage in superexchange (indirect) interactions between the metal spins, radical bridging ligands facilitate direct exchange interactions which results in much stronger magnetic coupling.  For transition metal complexes, this situation results in modest coupling and in lanthanide complexes these interactions are very weak. Magnetic coupling in both transition metal complexes and lanthanide rare earth complexes is greatly improved by using a radical bridging ligand that can engage in direct exchange with the metal ions.  In order to further improve upon these systems, the Dunbar group seeks to generate new classes of radical-bridged magnetic complexes using supramolecular strategies.  This project focuses on using N-heterocyclic neutral ligands that feature interactions between anions and electron deficient aromatic rings, namely the anion-pi interaction.  The neutral ligand can undergo a reversible one-electron reduction at accessible potentials to form a stable radical.   Computatonal studies are performed to identify the most synthetically feasible targets and guide the direction of research as it progresses.  Spontaneous self-assembly of paramagnetic metal ions with the ligands gives multinuclear supramolecular complexes in high yields due to anion and solvent templates.  A plethora of techniques (including single-crystal X-ray crystallography, SQUID magnetometry, electrochemistry, and electron paramagnetic resonance) is used to study the rich electronic, redox, and magnetic properties of these supramolecular architectures.  By comparing the properties of the complexes with a variety of ligands with different electron donating ability and coordinating geometry, this research aims to unveil the structural and electronic factors that contribute to superior magnetic coupling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation, Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Coran M. H. Watanabe from Texas A&M University to determine how nature constructs the azinomycins. These studies characterize the functions and structures of the proteins that catalyze the unique biochemical steps involved in generating the chemical features of the azinomycins that are important for their biological activity. The knowledge gained from this research paves the way for future engineering of genes to synthesize azinomycins within a tumor cell to treat cancer.  This project enables graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral trainees to develop broad skills in chemical biology and biotechnology.  Moreover, this research is integrated into a class that teaches how bioactive agents are derived from the environment. Students in this class collect soil samples, which are then assayed for natural products that show antibiotic activity.  In addition, local elementary, middle, and high school students learn about natural products and microbes in their lives through tailored lectures, demonstrations, and laboratory experiences.  Finally, as opportunities arise, Dr. Watanabe participates in events such as the American Cancer Society Relay for Life Events to inform the general public about cancer research and the daily work-related activities of a research active faculty member.    <br/><br/>The azinomycins are architecturally fascinating natural products. The natural product is densely functionalized with a naphtoate, epoxide, enol, and azabicyclic ring system.  The basic skeletal framework of the molecule is generated through a polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) pathway, while the aziridino[1,2-a]pyrollidine moiety is alkaloid derived.  From an enzymological perspective, this natural product represents a treasure trove of unusual biosynthetic transformations to be mined and paves the way for chemoenzymatic/synthetic biology efforts.  The goals of this project are to functionally reconstitute and characterize enzymes of the azinomycin biosynthetic pathway, and begin to develop ways to manipulate the pathway. The objectives towards these goals include 1) characterizing the enzymatic mechanism for biosynthesis of the naphthoate moiety of the azinomycins and analyze the structure-activity relationships of structurally and functionally related analogs of this mioety, 2) exploring the chemistry of the epoxide unit, and 3) functionally characterizing the enzymes for the biosynthesis of the azabicycle moiety.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, it was discovered that the active site of nickel-iron hydrogenase contains a protonated-coordinated nickel-sulfur bond.  This adds to a small, but growing number of enzymatic systems, such as nickel superoxide dismutase that contain this structural element.  This research group has recently shown that this feature is not only important in modulating the structure and properties of nickel-thiolate ligated systems, but can also be involved in reactions such as proton coupled electron transfer reactions.   This research seeks to understand the properties and reactivities of designed nickel containing small molecules and metallopeptide-based systems that contain the protonated nickel-sulfur bond.  A series of spectroscopic, computational, reactivity, and mechanistic studies are undertaken to understand these systems.   Information learned through these studies is used to rationally design systems with fine-tuned electronic and geometric structural properties that can perform specific reactions towards targeted substrates."

Specially, his research group develops a highly efficient and precious metal-free reaction for the synthesis and modification of hydrogels.  This project provides interdisciplinary research experience to many underrepresented undergraduate students, delivering a vital stepping stone toward careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Additionally, Professor Hobbs organizes Polymer Chemistry Workshops, in which high school teachers learn methods and experiments that can be used to introduce aspects of polymer chemistry in their science classes in the hopes of recruiting a new, diverse generation of young students to STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the utilization of a facile, catalyst-free substitution reaction between thiols and alpha-bromo esters for the preparation of a new class of hydrogels.  The process employs thio-bromo substitution reactions to convert alpha-bromoester-containing polynorbornenes and poly(oxanorbornene)s to polymers with functionality (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, and ionic groups) known to instill water-swellability to macromolecular architectures.  Cross-linking of the resulting polymers with dithiols produces a new class of hydrogels.   While the preparation of alpha-bromoester-containing polynorbornenes and poly(oxanorbornene)s by Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) requires the use of a ruthenium catalyst, the conversion of these polymers to hydrogels involves metal-free reactions that minimize the use of precious metals.  With the support from the NSF Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Hobbs' group conducts research to examine the effectiveness of this synthetic approach and the dependence of the hydrogel properties on the polymeric backbone, side chain groups, and cross-linker identity."

With cameras, pictures can be taken that show colors to help identify objects; for example, grass is green and sky is blue.  However, to look at molecules, more specific information is needed about the ""colors"" that molecules absorb. For many molecules, this absorption occurs in the infrared region of light.  To look at these infrared colors, traditional cameras are not very good so methods that can obtain pictures without cameras are necessary.  Professor Baldelli and Professor Kelly are developing a new type of microscope to figure out the surface image of surface molecules.  The results of this new microscope are useful to all researchers interested in surfaces related to biomaterials, energy, and environmental topics. For example, it can be used to study the distribution of lipid molecules on cell membranes that controls proteins moving in and out of cells, which in turn regulate cell growth and signaling. It can also be used to look at chemical dopants on a thin film that accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells, an important step in efficient energy conversion. The research project also presents a valuable opportunity to learn and experience collaborative multidisciplinary research -- a current emphasis of science and engineering education.  The topics and research project have many components to encourage undergraduate and high school students into the research, including instrument building, data analysis and interpretation, and research presentations.  This later point is an important aspect since it builds much confidence in the younger students and scientist.<br/><br/>Professors Baldelli and Kelly are developing a new state-of-the-art surface spectroscopic imaging microscope to study the molecular, spatial, and temporal evolution of patterns and chemical heterogeneity present in many fundamental and technologically important systems. This new CS-SFG (compressive sensing-sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy) imaging technique utilizes a digital mirror device (DMD).  The DMD is the heart of the DLP projector and flat screen displays.  It is a 2-D array of mirrors that reflects the SFG image onto a detector.  Using computer control and a random pattern generator, the signal intensity changes depending on which mirrors are reflecting toward the detector.  Each pattern results from 50% of the randomly chosen mirrors being turned on for each measurement.  After many such measurements, the image is reconstructed based on the signal and the known mirror pattern.  CS allows for efficient image acquisition where only a few percent of the total information is necessary to faithfully reconstruct the surface features.  Two configurations broad-band and narrow-band IR are set up to evaluate the effect on the image reconstruction.  In addition the detection system incorporates heterodyne detection to extract phase information forth monolayer signal.  This new capability allows for alternate imaging schemes and orientation analysis.  The effect of compression algorithms and quantitative analysis ultimately aid in the interpretation of heterogeneous monolayer films on surfaces. The CS-SFG microscope will be a significant improvement over current approaches that either use probe areas on the order of a millimeter or acquire the full hyperspectral data cube but at considerable expense in sample throughput. Once demonstrated, Professors Baldelli and Kelly are to employ this microscope to investigate the molecular-level static and dynamic details of chemical patterns (such as lipid domains) formed under the control condition of lithography and the transfer of films to solid substrates via the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The research project provides both graduate students and local high school students with highly interdisciplinary training in chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science."

The only samples of material from Mars that we can study here on Earth are the Mars meteorites. Organic matter has been found in some of the Mars meteorites, but scientists cannot agree on when, where, and how the organic matter formed. The investigators will study a sample of six Mars meteorites to learn about the composition and structure of the organics. This research will provide answers on how carbon in the young Mars formed and changed with time. These answers can then be used to address questions about how organic material formed on the young Earth, which places in the Solar System can host life, and what processes lead to the formation of life. This research serves the national interest by advancing our understanding of the processes that create life in and beyond the Solar System. The investigators will give at least two lessons on this study every year though NASA's Johnson Space Center's Classroom Connection Webinars, reaching 500 - 1700 students for each lesson. These lessons are also recorded. The investigators also interact with visiting educators through tours of the laboratory facilities.<br/><br/><br/>Mars meteorites are the only samples of the Martian crust currently available for laboratory analysis. This study will investigate the nature and origin of organic matter present within a suite of Mars meteorites. Although the presence of likely indigenous organic matter has been established in some Mars meteorites, scientists do not agree on when, where or how such matter formed. The answers to these questions are critical to understanding the Martian carbon cycle, the abiotic organic evolution of the early Mars (and by inference the early Earth), the identification of potentially habitable environments in the Solar System, and the processes leading to the origins of life. A selected group of six Mars meteorites will be studied systematically with the objectives of determining: [1] the molecular composition and abundance of organic phases and, where applicable, the texture and morphology of any discrete organic assemblage; and, [2] the spatial distribution of organics in relation to the underlying mineralogy. The investigators have pioneered these procedures and techniques in the analysis of extraterrestrial samples, and bring their collective expertise to the study. The investigators will give at least two lessons annually though NASA JSC ARES' Classroom Connection Webinars, reaching 500 - 1700 students live, with the lectures archived as recordings.

Single-celled organisms sense and respond to very small changes in their surroundings, but it is difficult to use these organisms as materials in engineering applications. By comparison, most synthetic materials do not respond to their environment or only respond to very large changes, but the properties of these materials can be readily controlled. This research effort will focus on the synthesis, 3D printing, and characterization of hybrid materials that combine the advantages of both living and non-living components. Specifically, Baker's yeast will be embedded in a hydrogel, a soft material largely comprised of water. The growth of these cells causes the entire material to change in shape. By controlling the genes of the yeast, materials can be built to change shape and produce specific biomolecules after detecting specific, small changes in the environment. These materials may be used for simple sensors capable of detecting and reporting changes in bodily fluids or in the environment. The behavior of these new materials could also enable drug-delivery devices that sense disease states in the gut and respond by delivering treatment to the area. This research will also create opportunities for K-12 students to learn about topics in both biology and materials science. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed work is to harness the controlled proliferation of microorganisms to create synthetic-living hydrogels capable of programmable shape change. Specifically, Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be embedded in acrylamide hydrogels, and the proliferation of these cells will induce shape change in the composite. The primary advantage of this approach, as compared to engineering purely synthetic, responsive materials, is that genetic engineering and material formulation can be used to program the macroscopic composite response to predetermined and incredibly specific stimuli. This work consists of four research tasks: 1) Quantify local and global mechanical deformation during proliferation-induced shape change of the composite and measure the effects of hydrogel mechanical properties on growth,  2) 3D print synthetic-living composites and measure the effects of geometry and porosity on composite growth, 3) Elucidate the fundamental relationship between dose and response and elucidate the specificity of living composites to metabolites, proteins, and light as stimuli that evoke shape change, and 4) Design hydrogel matrices that respond controllably to enzymes produced by the yeast, enabling feedback control of shape change. The effect of metabolites, stimuli, and proteins produced by the yeast on growth throughout the composite will be measured, thus providing understanding of the fundamental relationships that govern living materials. This work will address a critical need for materials that sense highly specific biochemical or weak physical cues and then respond in a controlled manner. These materials will impact areas of critical national need, including drug-delivery strategies that could be used in the gut and simple biochemical sensors.  Research activities will be coupled to outreach efforts for K-12 students on topics including genetics, hydrogels, and yeast. These efforts will be aimed at both increasing participation of underrepresented groups in science careers and dissemination of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These stars are excellent laboratories to study the extreme physics that accelerates stars. The stars are also key tracers of the Galaxy's elusive dark matter. Yet their origin and nature are still not well understood. With new data from the Gaia spacecraft, hundreds of these fast-moving elusive stars have been found. The investigator's primary goal to understand the origins and nature of HVSs. This project will also discover new HVSs using the next release of data from the Gaia mission. The chemical fingerprint of these fast-moving stars will also be measured to tag where they were born. The project will also measure the motions of these stars to constrain the mass of the Galaxy and determine the physics needed to accelerate stars to such high speeds. Each of these novel measurements will advance the field by providing key constraints of the origin of HVSs and use them to make inferences about the mass of the Milky Way and its dark matter halo. <br/><br/>The investigator will engage the public and train the next generation of our STEM workforce with an emphasis on under-represented minority students. The investigator will work with students from the TARUS program at the University of Texas. This program focuses on training minority students in various aspects of computer coding and research methods. This project, through TARUS, will provide underrepresented minority students technical expertise that can be transferable throughout STEM careers. The project will also advance public scientific literacy by creating an annual 'Stars on the Run' outreach night for Austin, TX area. This event will enable the public to learn about the fastest stars discovered by this project. It will also focus teaching the public about basic astronomical and physical principals.

Part of this process includes this material clumping into larger grains or pieces.  With the new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescopes, it is now possible to see material well into the zones in many of these disks where planets are forming.   In this project, the investigators will look first for clumps of dust of different sizes and structures in disks around other stars.  They will then study how the different structures affect the distribution of dust pieces having different sizes.  Finally, they will measure how the dust pieces are spread in the disk with respect to gases of different molecules.  The goal of this project is to learn whether the different observed structures trap solid dust pieces.   This project serves the national interest by advancing our understanding of the science behind the formation of planetary systems.  A postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student will conduct the research.  All of the raw and processed data will be available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This project will study the formation of planets by mapping small-scale structures in nearby circumstellar disks around pre-main sequence stars, using ALMA and VLA radio observations that will resolve material well into the planet-forming zones of a large sample of disks.  The research has three main goals.  First, quantify the prevalence and morphology of small-scale structures in the distribution of dust particles. This will be achieved by mapping the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission in 20 nearby disks at an angular resolution of about 0.04"".  Second, study how these structures affect the distribution of dust grains with different sizes.  To do this, multi-wavelength observations between 0.87 mm and 1 cm, which probe the distribution of mm- and cm-sized dust grains, will be acquired.  Third, measure the distribution of dust particles relative to the molecular gas.  This goal will be achieved by mapping the molecular line emission (e.g., CO) from disks characterized by substructures at an angular resolution comparable to that of the continuum maps.  The goal is to understand if the observed structures trap solid dust particles, therefore solving the long-standing radial migration problem.  A postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student will conduct the data analysis and publication of the results.  Additionally, the scientific community will receive access to the full suite of data products derived from this program."

Our own Milky Way galaxy is regarded as 'normal' in the Universe today, stretching 100,000 light years across and forming stars at a rate of 1-2 new suns per year.  But, as we look farther out into the Universe, it seems that galaxies in the distant past (10 billion years ago) were dramatically different.  Extreme ""starbursting"" galaxies that produced 100 to 2,000 stars per year were much more typical, and most stars formed at that time came from such starbursts.  The awarded team is trying to determine why these galaxies were so important in the Universe's history and why they are so extreme, for example whether or not they are caused by the catastrophic collision of two smaller galaxies, or whether the gas (the fuel needed to power star formation) was more dense and efficient when the Universe was much younger.  These extreme starbursts are also heavily obscured by dust, making them hard to see in optical light visible to our eyes.  Cutting edge radio-wavelength data from the e-MERLIN telescope will be used to peer through the dust and determine the powering mechanism for the Universe's most extreme starbursting galaxies.  This project will support the retention of under-represented students in astrophysics research through participation in the TAURUS program at UT Austin, where undergraduate students spend nine weeks of the summer on a research project.  The awardee will be proactive in engaging and supporting under-represented students in communities like TAURUS.<br/><br/>With a unique data set of high-resolution (0.""1) deep (4 uJy) radio 1.4 GHz continuum data from e-MERLIN covering 1.77 deg^2 in the SuperCLASS field, the awardees will assess the evolutionary origins of highly-obscured radio galaxies in a statistically large sample (few x 100) out to z~3.  The objectives are to answer the following questions: (1) Are the high-SFRs in dusty starbursts primarily driven by galaxy interactions or not?  (2) Does feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in obscured starbursts play a role in suppressing star-formation?  Or is there no discernible difference in star formation seen in starbursts with or without radio-luminous AGN (and what is the dependence on the AGN luminosity)?  (3) What do galaxies' star-formation surface densities tell us about the intensity of star formation and relative obscuration geometries (when compared to optical imaging)?  (4) Can one learn about the physical origins of the mysterious far-infrared/radio correlation by analyzing galaxies' radio synchrotron slope and radio morphologies?  Answering these questions through direct morphological analysis of the e-MERLIN SuperCLASS data products will have significant impact on galaxy evolution studies."
