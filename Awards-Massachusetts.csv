These developments enable a new class of algorithms for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, astronomical imaging, microscopy, and imaging based on X-ray diffractions.  These new algorithms have the potential to drastically reduce the time and expense of scientific and medical data collection for the purpose of imaging.  For example, using these techniques, MRI machines could increase in efficiency, allowing shorter scan times and shorter waits for medical care.  Additionally, these new techniques can accelerate the process of drug discovery and development by minimizing the cost of imaging of molecules.  While some new algorithms have recently appeared, theoretical understanding of them is currently minimal.  This is a serious concern as technology, upon which professionals make scientific discoveries and medical diagnoses, should be reliable in common and novel situations.  The investigator and his colleagues introduce novel approaches for recovering images, scientific and medical, that succeed while needing less data than earlier methods.  Additionally, the investigator and his colleagues provide mathematical justification for why such imaging methods recover a sufficiently high-quality image.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues develop a rigorous recovery theory for multiple signal recovery problems in the context of generative neural network priors.  These problems are linear compressed sensing, phase retrieval, and blind deconvolution.  In each, the recovery problem is phrased as a nonconvex optimization under the constraint that the desired signal belongs to the range of a pre-trained generative model given by an artificial neural network.  For each problem, the investigator and his colleagues provide (1) computationally efficient, specific numerical algorithms with convergence guarantees that (2) operate at optimal sample complexity with respect to the dimensionality of the modeled manifold of natural signals, and (3) apply to realistic neural network architectures.  The impact of this work follows from two ideas: (1) generative priors learned from data may provide lower-dimensional representations than sparsity priors in many contexts; and (2) generative priors may be easier to exploit than sparsity priors in nonlinear inverse problems such as phase retrieval.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional machine learning algorithms often lack scalable computational complexity, while modern approaches lack solid mathematical foundations. Moreover, high data dimensionality creates challenges for traditional methods of data analysis. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to combine classic dimension reduction methods with data-driven distances, so that both the distance and embedding procedure are data dependent. This novel approach allows for greater flexibility in balancing the density-based and geometric features of the data, achieves a density-based simplification of geometry, and insightfully represents the data in a small number of dimensions. In contrast to black box methods such as deep learning, the developed methodology can be rigorously analyzed to derive strong theoretical guarantees for several statistical and machine learning tasks. This research will contribute computational tools for cancer immunogenomics and the investigators will consult with the Rogel Cancer Center at the University of Michigan for scientific questions related to tumor immunology and T-cell biology. In addition, new data analysis tools will be made publicly available in an open source software package. <br/><br/>The investigators' approach is driven by the analysis of a family of data-dependent path metrics. These metrics are both density-sensitive and geometry-preserving, with the balance governed by the choice of a single parameter p. By utilizing the space of paths through data, the PIs will obtain density based metrics and embeddings while avoiding the explicit computation of a density estimator, which may be unreliable in a large number of dimensions. The PIs will propose a simple yet highly flexible data model which does not assume the data is sampled from a manifold or collection of manifolds, and investigate the continuous limit of these metrics and an associated graph Laplacian operator. By continuously varying the parameter p, the PIs will propose to create data videos which represent the data from multiple perspectives. The PIs will investigate both multidimensional scaling and graph Laplacian embeddings as mechanisms for obtaining path-based low dimensional representations, and will explore fast algorithms with scalable computational complexity for approximating these metrics. The PIs will contextualize path metrics in the larger frame work of data-driven metrics and focus specifically on the analysis of biological data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, how do the thousands of heart cells that form the heart's natural pacemaker network manage to fire an electrical pulse simultaneously?  How does a flock of birds or school of fish organize so as to fly or swim together?  What causes a population of fireflies to flash in unison?  How can we prevent a single component failure in a large power grid from cascading through the entire network?  The investigators' particular interest is in networks of oscillators, in which the individual components cycle periodically in time.  Oscillator networks can exhibit a variety of collective behaviors, ranging in simplicity from complete synchronization, when all the oscillators behave in unison, to more complex patterns such as chimera states, where part of the network is synchronized while the rest exhibits asynchronous behavior.  The investigators develop mathematical tools, using geometry, group theory, and dimensional reduction, to greatly simplify the analysis of oscillator networks and their stability.  The virtue of this approach is that the behavior of a large network with many variables can be precisely described using only a small number of equations.  They use these methods to design and analyze networks with applications to reservoir computing and machine learning, an important and developing area of modern data analysis.  An important ramification of this work is to forge interdisciplinary collaborations between the more applied study of oscillator dynamics and the pure mathematical study of low-dimensional geometry.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The central theme of this project is the application of geometric and group-theoretic techniques to the study of networks of Kuramoto and more general types of oscillators.  The application of geometric techniques makes possible the explicit description of the dynamics on group orbits.  Building on on their earlier work using this methodology, the investigators take up four topics.  The first classifies higher degree order parameter functions that have a geometric (gradient) structure similar to the classic Kuramoto model with first degree order parameter.  Topic 2 uses geometric techniques to understand the dynamics of multi-population models, particularly to clarify the dynamics of chimera states, which are states with some but not all of the populations completely synchronized.  Topic 3 extends this structure to networks of higher-dimensional oscillators, with states on spheres of dimension 2 or higher, that are used to model flocks, swarms and other social networks.  Topic 4 applies this technology to machine learning and reservoir computing.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new particles, symmetries or forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). This project is designed to pursue searches for BSM physics. <br/><br/>The LHC is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology group is a collaboration member of LHCb, an experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks at the LHC and to search for other new states of matter.  The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of hadrons containing the b and c quarks, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. <br/><br/>Additionally, LHCb is making contributions to the study of the emergent phenomenology of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and to searches for new GeV-scale (i.e. ""low mass"") BSM particles, possibly components of the dark sector of matter.  And it is in this research domain that the MIT group is playing a leading and fundamental role, both in the development of new trigger strategies based upon machine learning algorithms to identify and select the physics of interest, but also in conducting analyses of interactions that might contain hypothetical ""dark sector"" particles such as dark photons or axion-like particles.  <br/><br/>The analytical activities associated with these dark sector studies are enhanced in this program through collaboration with Technion in Israel, through  the United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (NSF-BSF) program.<br/><br/>The machine learning algorithms developed by the MIT-LHCb group are available in open-source software packages and are being used by many other research groups.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently spreading across the world rapidly, including in the United States, with major adverse impact on health and the economy. The SARSCoV-2 outbreak has led to several urgent efforts to develop vaccines that may offer protection against this virus. It is unknown as to whether the current approaches being pursued will elicit protective immune responses in humans. While vaccines have been very effective against many pathogens, the empirical methods for vaccine development pioneered by Pasteur and Jenner over two centuries ago have failed to produce effective vaccines against Human Immune Deficiency Virus, Malaria, Tuberculosis, and many other pathogens. Therefore, rational design of vaccines based on a mechanistic understanding of the pertinent virology and immunology is being pursued, and these efforts include work that is rooted in statistical physics. SARSCoV-2 is phylogenetically most similar to SARS-CoV. This project will use a machine learning approach to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with the immune T cells. This work will directly impact the design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and vaccines against future endemic-causing pathogens.<br/><br/>Analyses of patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV shows that antibody responses are not prevalent a few years later, but memory T cell responses are durable and may offer long-term protection. The main questions addressed by this project are 1. Will the SARS-CoV peptides targeted by human T cells that are mutated in SARS-CoV-2 still elicit human T cell responses - i.e. are they immunogenic? 2: Are the 102 peptides identified by host major histocompatibility molecules binding assays alone that are common between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic in humans? If not, they are irrelevant from vaccine design perspective. The goal of the work proposed here is to take a physics-based machine learning approach to determine the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to human T cell responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It describes the fundamental building blocks of the universe, including the elementary particles whose interactions are measured at the Large Hadron Collider, and it also describes the sources of energy that drive the evolution of the cosmos.  In this way string theory is capable of connecting particle physics and cosmology.  The research funded by this award focuses on the implications of string theory for these two disciplines. There are two central challenges. First, certain aspects of string theory proper still remain to be understood. In particular, in collaboration with mathematicians, Halverson will study the regime in which strings interact strongly. An improved understanding of this regime is necessary for a complete understanding of string interactions. Second, string theory predicts a vast array of possible laws of physics --- an array known as the string landscape --- prompting the question of how the laws we observe are realized in nature and whether their realization leads to new predictions for experiments. From a practical point of view, however, the landscape can be viewed as an enormous dataset. As part of this project, Halverson, in collaboration with computer scientists, will therefore utilize techniques from data science and machine learning to study the landscape.  Research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of physical law.   Halverson's research will also have significant broader impacts by enabling and engaging new communities of researchers. These include professionals in industry, high-school students, and the internet data-science community. Among Halverson's activities, a lecture series will be developed for and delivered to members of these communities in order to give them the essential background information for carrying out research at the interface of data science and string theory. <br/><br/>More technically, Halverson will carry out formal work at strong coupling in string theory. He will study string junctions in F-theory on singular spaces, aspects of non-Higgsable clusters, and G2 compactifications of M-theory. He will also study physical problems in the string landscape using techniques from data science, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks. The interplay between computational complexity and the use of these techniques in physical problems will be addressed. Halverson will also study the particle physics and cosmological implications of the low-energy degrees of freedom that arise regularly in the landscape, including those associated with large dark gauge sectors and the string axiverse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inhibitors that target these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Drs. Mary Jo Ondrechen and Penny J. Beuning from Northeastern University to apply computational methods to identify sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins that would be good targets for binding inhibitors. The project uses artificial intelligence methods developed at Northeastern University to identify pockets and crevices in the structures of viral proteins that may serve as new targets for the development of antiviral agents. Large datasets of natural and synthetic compounds are computationally searched for molecules that fit into these alternative sites, and any compounds that fit will be experimentally tested for their ability to inhibit the functions of these viral enzymes. The project provides training in computational chemistry and biochemical analysis to graduate students and postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>This project uses the unique Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) machine learning (ML) method developed by Dr. Ondrechen?s group to predict multiple types of binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including catalytic sites, allosteric sites, and other interaction sites. The goals of this project are to apply the POOL-ML method to identify the binding sites on viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 proteins using the three-dimensional protein structures as input. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to generate conformations for ensemble docking. Compounds from the large molecular databases are computationally docked into the predicted sites to identify potentially strong binding ligands. Candidate ligands to selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the main protease and 2?-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase, are experimentally tested in vitro for binding affinity and the effect of the best predicted inhibitors on catalytic activities determined by direct biochemical assays. All the SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are studied. Compound libraries for the study include: a) selected 2600+ compounds from the ZINC and Enamine databases that are already being manufactured; b) a library of 20,000+ compounds found in foods that the team recently gained access to; these potentially hold some special advantages, including ready availability in the public domain and low cost; and c) the March 2020 open access CAS (American Chemical Society) database of 50,000 compounds with known or potential anti-viral activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A dynamical system is a function from a space to itself.  Points in the space represent possible states of the phenomenon and the function describes how the states evolve over time.  Even relatively simple dynamical systems can exhibit very complicated long-term behaviors.  Properties of the dynamical systems are often reflected in the shapes of associated mathematical sets.  The principal investigator will investigate the shapes of dynamically defined sets that arise in three different contexts: (1) self-maps of intervals; (2) holomorphic dynamics, and (3) neural networks.  In addition to advances in the theory of dynamical systems and geometry, results could lead to new techniques in computer graphics or machine learning.  <br/><br/>The three main goals of this project are to: (1) establish topological and geometrical properties of Thurston sets for various families of dynamical systems; (2) characterize the shapes of Julia sets of polynomials in one and several complex variables; (3) describe how network architecture constrains the decision regions of neural networks.  The Thurston set for the family of superattracting unimodular self-maps of an interval is the closure of the set of all Galois conjugates of the exponentials of the topological entropies of all such maps.  Plots of this set reveal that it has a rich and mysterious geometric structure.  In previous work, the principal investigator characterized which subsets of the complex plane are approximable (in a strong sense) by Julia sets of polynomials.  No analogous characterization of the possible global shapes of basins of attraction of infinity for polynomials in several complex variables is known, and the principal investigator will work to extend her techniques to this setting.   Similarly, the principal investigator will investigate topological and geometrical obstructions to approximability by decision regions of neural networks of fixed network architectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports investigations at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst into one possible origin of this imbalance through the study of whether the lightest fundamental particle in Nature, the neutrino, is made of both matter and anti-matter.   If this is the case, a very rare nuclear process known as neutrino-less double beta decay is possible. This decay, in which a nucleus transforms into another by emitting two electrons and nothing else, would unambiguously determine that neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the same particle, i.e. that they are Majorana particles.  The work at UMass Amherst focuses on key R&D aspects for the design of the detector for the nEXO experiment, with research carried out in the lab with postdocs and students (graduate and undergraduate), in an academic, research-intensive environment.  The PI and his group are also involved in operating and analyzing the data of the EXO-200 experiment, a smaller scale nEXO predecessor running in New Mexico and holding one of the best sensitivities for neutrino-less double beta decay to date.  The activities supported by this award train human resources of diverse backgrounds and develop technologies that align with strategic sectors for the US, such as data science and artificial intelligence, nuclear medicine and non-proliferation, and national security programs at national laboratories. The UMass Amherst particle astrophysics group has a record of excellence and diversity for undergraduate involvement in research, and the Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions (ACFI) actively contributes to promoting the physics related to this proposal to the broader physics community.<br/><br/><br/>The core of the nEXO detector is a Time Projection Chamber (TPC), a technology that can identify and suppress with high efficiency most background signals mimicking neutrinoless-double beta decays. The detector will measure the position and energy of each ionizing event occurring inside its volume, as well as finer information about the spatial distribution and sharing of event energy between two detection channels, ionization and scintillation light. Combined with a detector design that minimizes the residual radioactivity in its constituents, this information provides a powerful environment for a neutrino-less double beta decay signal to emerge once all other interactions are properly identified. The UMass Amherst group works on the development of key elements of nEXO. The PI coordinates the design of the nEXO TPC. With his group, he studies novel silicon-based detectors (specifically Silicon PhotoMultipliers, SiPMs) sensitive to the xenon scintillation light (178 nm) that combine good light collection efficiency, minimal radioactive contamination, uniformity of response, and are practically available to cover several square meters of surface in nEXO.   An integral part of the program is a continued participation in the EXO-200 experiment, and the analysis of its data.

The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. The CNO neutrino flux depends on the abundance of carbon in the core of the Sun. A measurement of the CNO flux would be the first direct measurement of the solar metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) in the core of the Sun. It could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the Sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the Sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. Borexino is a liquid scintillator detector, located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, with a unique sensitivity to solar neutrinos.<br/><br/>The Borexino research program has involved many undergraduate and graduate students. Mentoring and training young researchers at the collaborating institutions and other schools has always been a high priority. The three groups will continue to involve undergraduate students in this research and disseminate research to the broader community.<br/><br/>The research funded here plans to measure neutrinos from the catalytic reactions on 12-C and 15-N which convert four protons to 4-He, producing neutrinos from the beta decays of 13-N and 15-O. The CN neutrino flux depends directly on the abundance of 12-C and 15-N in the core of the Sun, and their measurement would be the first direct measurement of the metallicity (elements heavier than 4-He), in the core of the Sun. This result will be far reaching because the solar composition is the basis for many important topics in astrophysics, including stellar structure, stellar evolution, and stellar atmospheres, to name a few. In addition, it will address the 'solar composition problem', the apparent disagreement in metallicity determined from recent advances in analysis of solar photospheric optical spectra, which favors a low metallicity, and advances in helioseismology, which favors high metallicity. Since modifications of the Standard Solar Model to explain a non-uniform solar composition have not been very successful, the 'solar composition problem' remains an unexplained flaw in the Standard Solar Model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are too many features that the model does not explain, including the origin of dark matter, why neutrino masses are so light, how the matter-antimatter asymmetry arose, and why Charge-Parity-violation only appears when weak forces are concerned.  These are the questions that motivate the Rare Event Search Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). This award provides support for two beyond-Standard-Model searches: the axion search ABRACADABRA, and the neutrinoless double-beta decay (NLDBD) search KamLAND-Zen and related R&D project NuDot.  ABRACADABRA will undertake a search for axions, which are one of the particles postulated to form dark matter.  A demonstration of neutrinoless double-beta decay would address the questions of why neutrino masses are so light and what produces the matter-anti-matter asymmetry in the universe.<br/><br/>The program will deliver several beneficial aspects to society through its integration of undergraduates into the program. The multidisciplinary aspects of the projects are appealing to students across a range of majors, exposing students to particle and nuclear physics when they might otherwise have missed the opportunity. The NuDOT and ABRACADABRA detectors are being developed in close association with scientists at local companies. This exposes the undergraduates in the group to alternative career paths as well as promoting strong ties between academia and industry<br/><br/>KamLAND-Zen will be the first ton-scale NLDBD experiment. NuDot, which is a potential upgrade path, can open the door to even large scales. On the other hand, ABRACADABRA is leading the way in a new wave of ""table top"" beyond-Standard-Model experiments. This is a largely unknown experiment, because it is about to bring out first results. ABRACADABRA brings discovery-level particle physics back to the university. The high intellectual merit of the proposed studies is demonstrated by the excellent alignment of the physics questions with the ""science drivers"" identified by the Particle Physics Program Prioritization Panel (P5). This proposal addresses: 1) the pursuit of the physics associated with neutrino mass; 2) the identification of the new physics of dark matter; and 3) the exploration of the unknown for new particles, interactions and physical principles. This work is similarly well-aligned with the Long Range Plan of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC), which made the call to move quickly on NLDBD experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional cellular recording platforms are based on metals or semiconductors, and these are often limited by compromised signal coupling and compatibility issues, largely due to the intrinsic mismatch of physical and chemical properties at biotic/abiotic interfaces. The proposed research aims  to overcome this key limitation by designing and developing electronic materials that can be biologically assembled from nature's building blocks and thus inherently integrative to biological systems. This new biomaterial platform has the potential to be translated into a wide range of biomedical applications, such as prosthesis, cardiac repair/regeneration, brain-machine interfaces, etc. As part of this CAREER award, the PI plans to exploit biomaterials research as a tool to improve STEM learning and broaden STEM participation. The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed project and the integration of research and educational activities make them particularly well-suited for educational purposes and training future scientists. A series of learning modules will be developed based on the proposed research project that will be used to enrich the curriculum of undergraduate courses, train and guide undergraduate and graduate researchers, and disseminate cutting-edge knowledge and experiences in biomaterials. The PI also plans to further broaden STEM participation by providing summer internship opportunities to underrepresented high-school students, stimulating their interest in STEM fields, and preparing them for success in higher education and STEM careers.  <br/><br/>Technical: <br/>The optimal detection and interpretation of electrical signals generated by excitable cells represents a key to understanding, interrogating and directing many biologically significant processes. The proposed research aims to explore and investigate Bio-derived conductive protein Nanowires (BNWs) as a new category of nanoelectronic probes for minimally invasive cellular interfacing and signal transduction. Specific aims of this research are focusing on: 1) achieving controlled growth and assembly of biologically derived nano-wires with rationally designed properties; 2) defining the structure-function relationship and elucidating the fundamental charge transport mechanisms/limits at single BNW level; and 3) exploring the implication of BNWs in electrical cellular interfacing. By developing a nanoscale biomaterials platform that is mechanically compliant, electrically active, and biologically relevant, the proposed research is expected to fill the gap between living systems and artificial electronics to open up new knowledge base for both fundamental bioelectric studies and biomedical applications. The proposed research in developing a nano-scale biomaterials platform has the potential to overcome the current limitation in the compromised signal coupling and biocompatibility due to the intrinsic mismatch of the physical and chemical properties between the solid-state materials and biological systems. Additionally, these research efforts will be closely integrated with educational activities at both K-12 and college levels. A research-intensive educational program will be fostered, where the students will be exposed to the cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research strategies and techniques. Underrepresented minority high school students from local communities will also be involved in these research efforts through summer internship programs to further broaden participation in STEM areas."

It is surprising that we do not better understand how electrons work together. This award supports studies of a novel substance, an ultracold gas of strongly interacting atoms, which behaves in many ways like electrons. For example, just like a metal becomes ""superconducting"" at low temperatures and starts to conduct electricity without resistance, the atomic gas becomes ""superfluid"" and atoms flow without friction. However, scaled to the density of electrons in metals, superfluidity would occur in the atomic gas already far above room temperature, thanks to the strong interatomic interactions. Just like electrons, but also protons and neutrons, the atoms belong to the class of particles called fermions, which cannot share one and the same state. This requirement makes computations extremely difficult and experiments indispensable to learn about the behavior of fermions. Confined in an artificial ""box"" of light, the atomic Fermi gas will be a pristine platform to learn about the equation of state of strongly interacting fermions, as they occur in modern materials, for example high-temperature superconductors, but also in neutron stars and nuclear matter. With the help of these and other studies, we might be led to an understanding on how to realize room temperature superconductivity. The project also holds the potential for observing new states of fermionic matter such as a supersolid--a superfluid that is also ordered like a crystal. The research will present a stimulating learning experience for graduate students.<br/><br/>Ultracold Fermi gases of atoms represent a paradigmatic form of fermionic matter, where all details of the interparticle interaction, the external confinement, and the spin composition are precisely known and under the control of the experimenter. This project employs a Fermi gas of Lithium-6 atoms to try to answer long-standing questions about 1) the thermodynamics of two- and three-dimensional systems, 2) the fate of fermionic superfluidity in the presence of spin imbalance and 3) non-equilibrium dynamics in fermionic superfluids. The Fermi gas will be confined in tailored potentials, in particular a homogeneous box potential and a hybrid harmonic-box potential. Creating a homogeneous Fermi gas will take away many of the existing experimental limitations in obtaining accurate thermodynamic information. The box potential allows accessing new phases of fermionic matter that have not been observed before. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid in two dimensions features algebraic order that would be masked in an inhomogeneous trap. A homogeneous 3D Fermi superfluid in the presence of spin imbalance should spontaneously break translational symmetry by forming a train of solitons, where excess fermions reside in the nodes of the order parameter. This describes the famous Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state, a supersolid phase of matter that has not been conclusively observed despite five decades of research. In the present work, soliton trains will be directly created in the presence of spin imbalance, thereby engineering the LO state."

Learning to build smart, digital, and mechanically functional objects at the microscale could be as revolutionary as human-scale manufacturing. This grant will support research to develop a new way of meeting this challenging goal. It combines two technologies: modern magnetic information storage, which can create tiny magnets in any pattern desired, and ultrathin flexible materials that can bend in response to tiny forces. These will be combined with the design principles of colloidal systems, polymer physics, and molecular biology to create intelligent, functional objects, machines, and materials. The pieces will interact in a way analogous to the way DNA bases bind together, with magnets playing the role of the base pairs, and the thin materials playing the role of the DNA backbone. The magnetic information will determine how multiple strands connect and form complex structures and micron sized machines that can be controlled with external magnetic fields. These materials will ultimately have fundamental impacts on micro-engineering, with a range of potential applications, from materials to medicine. As such, this research will promote the progress of science and ultimately benefit the US economy and society. This research borrows concepts from a variety of fields - a multi-disciplinary approach that will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering and science education. For example, macroscopic analogs will be adopted into lending kits that will be used to explain the basic principles behind base paring in DNA and its assembly into DNA origami structures to impoverished communities in upper Appalachia.<br/> <br/> <br/>Technical Description: This grant will support research aimed at building a new platform for self-assembly that uses panels with magnetic handshakes - microscopic patterns of magnetic dipoles - that enable panels to bond together using specific, intelligent interactions analogous to Watson-Crick base pairs in DNA. By fabricating these panels on nm thin elastic strands grown via atomic layer deposition, the panel sequence will determine how multiple strands connect to one another and form complex untethered structures and micron sized machines that can be manipulated with external magnetic fields. These handshake panels will be programmed using either magneto-optic recording (micron scale) or commercial scanned magnetic write head (50 nm scale). The resulting magnetic colloids, strands, or nets will be released from the substrate into solution, and allowed to bend, move, and assemble according to their designed interactions. The approach of the grant is to integrate design, macroscale models, advanced simulations, and experiment, to master the programmed self-assembly of these magnetic handshake materials. Overall, this strategy both takes advantage of the complementary binding principle behind current state of the art 3D DNA based assembly and overcomes many of its limitations, including vastly expanding the range of operating parameters such as temperature, solvent, etc. The resulting structures can be fully integrated with other lithographic elements (electronics, optics, etc.) and will have broad applications in sensing, actuation, and microrobotics at the cellular scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a key application, implementation of the technology obtained from this research on medical images will enable automatic report generation. This technology could reduce the workload of radiologists significantly, and hence reduce human error and optimize resource utilization. Ultimately, reduction in human error or missing cases in radiology can greatly benefit patient well-being and care.

Despite these rapid and impressive empirical advances, machine learning remains only partially understood mathematically. In particular, unsupervised anomaly detection in which algorithms must distinguish background from anomaly with no labeled data and active learning in which only a very small but carefully selected number of points may be queried for labels are ripe for transformational advances. As sensors generate ever increasing datasets, the sheer volume of data overwhelms human capacity for generating the kinds of large training sets necessary for traditional supervised learning algorithms. The future of machine learning relies on developing new mathematical approaches to unsupervised and active learning, where no or little training data is required.  Innovations in this direction have potential to transform fields as diverse as computational medicine, network security, and image processing.  This project will support 1 graduate student in the second and third years of the grant.<br/><br/>This research project develops new algorithms for anomaly detection and active learning in spatiotemporal data. The emphasis is on the analysis of high-dimensional, time-evolving data sets in a manner that is robust to nonlinear geometries, variable sampling rates, and large quantities of noise and outliers.  The PI proposes two distinct but related lines of research. First, to devise multitemporal anomaly detection algorithms using landscape cluster networks. This approach handles temporally varying distributions and labels clusters and anomalies at different levels of granularity, providing confidence estimates and uncertainty quantifications. Second, diffusion geometric active learning algorithms for spatiotemporal data will be developed to allow a human analyst to label a small number of queries from the algorithm. These queries are carefully chosen, and the labels provided by the human analyst can radically improve cluster and anomaly detection at minimal computational burden. The proposed methods are robust to complicated data geometries, temporal sampling rates, noise and outliers, and ambient dimensionality of the data. Beyond the topics of machine learning, this project makes broader contributions to probability theory, harmonic analysis, spectral graph theory, high-dimensional statistics, and computational linear algebra.  Mathematical and algorithmic contributions will be developed in parallel with scientific collaborations analyzing large spatiotemporal datasets. This project focuses on anomaly detection and active learning in three distinct spatiotemporal data settings: large-scale commuting networks, hyperspectral image analysis, and high energy particle physics. The proposed methods allow for real-time anomaly and threat detection, are scalable, and mitigate the need for large training sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Mary Jo Ondrechen, Dr. Penny Beuning and Dr. Deniz Erdogomus at Northeastern University to develop new ways to predict the function of a protein from its three-dimensional structure. This computational problem is a major challenge in genomics - the study of DNA sequences and their protein products. Research in genomics is opening the door to tremendous current and future innovations to benefit society, in areas as diverse as food production, energy, the economy, the environment, and health. In this project, chemical properties are computed and coupled with machine learning algorithms to identify the specific biochemical roles for the active amino acids in a protein structure, which then leads to the prediction of the protein's function. These predictions of function are tested experimentally by direct biochemical assays and by ligand binding studies, for selected cases. Doctoral students and undergraduate research interns, including those from minority groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields, are being trained through this project to become highly qualified scientists in the areas of computational chemistry, informatics, machine learning, and biochemistry. These skills are vital to the regional high-tech economy of New England and to United States competitiveness in the global economy. <br/><br/>The computational prediction of biochemical functional roles of individual amino acids in a protein structure is entirely new. The predictive power of properties obtained from computational chemistry are being enhanced by machine learning approaches, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Improved, experimentally tested methods for the prediction of protein function contribute significantly to the interpretation of the massive quantities of data from genome sequencing and Structural Genomics (SG) initiatives. A significant feature of this project is that it incorporates computed chemical properties of the amino acids in a protein structure into more conventional informatics methods to predict function, whereas most current methods are purely informatics-based approaches. This project is unique in that it employs computed chemical reactivity and electrostatic features on the atomic scale in the protein function prediction problem to obtain residue-specific mechanistic information. With the capability to match functional types across different structural folds, i.e. cases with neither sequence nor 3D structure similarity, the ability to assign biochemical function reliably is substantially increased for SG proteins of unknown or uncertain function. This work also leads to better understanding of how enzymes work and of how specific amino acid residues achieve their catalytic power.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports research and education that will not only have technological implications but will also tackle fundamental questions in physics that could lead to unanticipated discoveries.<br/><br/>The quest for materials with novel functionality is driven by the study of quantum systems where interactions among the constituent electrons are very strong. These interactions can give rise to complex and intriguing phenomena that take place when the physics is mostly governed by the collective behavior of the electrons inside the material.  One particular example occurs when considering electrons confined in low spatial dimensions: the confinement forces electrons to move by ""pushing"" instead of passing around each other. Same as oscillations of a string, the natural excitations of such a confined system of electrons can be better understood in terms of waves. As a consequence, electrons lose their individual identities as particles. This project focuses on understanding how electrons lose or recover their identities as individual excitations and how their behavior is subsequently transformed, giving rise to different phases in the material.<br/><br/>Even though these problems are theoretically very challenging due to their underlying complexity, they are amenable to numerical methods. The focus of the research is computational in nature and will also involve the development of new innovative algorithms based on quantum information and machine-learning ideas. New tools for scientific discovery will be developed and will be made available to the community as open-source software that may find applications in other disciplines beyond condensed matter physics.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award will support research and education focused on tackling urgent questions concerning different instabilities in strongly correlated materials due to the presence of antiferromagnetic long-range order and van Hove singularities. This project tackles a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter from a new perspective. In order to overcome the limitations of the Mermin-Wagner theorem, chains and ladders will be studied in the presence of long-range interactions that can realize actual spontaneous symmetry breaking and true antiferromagnetic order. The research will address questions of a very fundamental nature: i) How do spinons evolve into magnons and what are their signatures in the excitation spectrum? ii) Is it possible to realize fractionalized excitations and coherent excitations simultaneously in different regions of the Brillouin zone? iii) How do coherent quasiparticles form (if at all), in the presence of long-range order? Will we still observe signatures of spin-charge separation in the spectrum? iv) What is the interplay between long-range antiferromagnetic order and pairing? v) What terms in the Hamiltonian would give rise to competing instabilities such as those observed in superconducting cuprates? The method of choice will be the density matrix renormalization group and its time-dependent variants, which were co-developed by the PI and have had a remarkable success expanding our knowledge of correlation effects to the time domain.<br/><br/>This work is complemented by the development of novel computational approaches to tackle higher-dimensional systems based on new original ideas that bridge quantum information and machine learning: i) The use of lapped orthogonal orbitals that interpolate between real- and momentum-space representations, ii) Quantum disentanglers and natural orbitals to construct the wave functions of the elementary quasiparticle excitations, and iii) Using restricted Boltzmann machines to calculate the single-particle Green's functions, and therefore reconstruct the entire excitation spectrum of the quantum many-body problem. These new tools will be made available to the community as open-source software that may find applications in other disciplines beyond condensed matter physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is dictated by the necessity of analyzing large scale statistical models, where the scale of the data ever increases due to our unprecedented ability to accumulative massive amounts of it. Often this leads to models where the number of parameters far exceeds the amount of collected data,  rendering many classical inference models ill-posed and classical computational methods prohibitively time consuming. Thus the value brought about by the abundance of data comes at the expense of the necessity to develop completely novel computational tools that are capable of dealing with the curse of dimensionality. While there is  an abundance  of literature devoted to designing efficient computational methods of inference in high-dimensional statistical models, it was discovered that many algorithms hit a certain computational barrier, beyond which seemingly only brute-force and thus computationally prohibitive algorithms can succeed. Not much is known regarding the fundamental computational limitations arising above this barrier, which is  popularly dubbed  the nformation Theoretic vs Computation gap. What is the origin of this barrier? Does it indeed correspond to the onset of algorithmically intractable problems, or is it just a matter of being more clever about designing faster algorithms? The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>In the present project the PI develops a completely novel approach for understanding fundamental computational barriers arising in high dimensional statistical models. The approach  is based on powerful and illuminating insights derived from the field of statistical physics,  specifically the theory of spin glasses. In particular, the PI intends to establish that the onset of the algorithmic barriers is caused by phase transition in the landscape of the solution space, marking a drastic change in the solution space geometry of  underlying inference problems. This change in geometry of the solution space landscape taking the form of the so-called Overlap Gap Property (OGP), can further be used to rule out broad classes of algorithms as potential contenders to bridge the information theoretic and algorithmic gap. These classes of algorithms include  algorithms based on local improvements, such as  Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descend algorithms, algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method, algorithms broadly defined as Approximate Message Passing iterations, and algorithms based on constructing low-degree polynomials. The PI in particular intends to investigate the validity of a bold conjecture stating that for most, if not all of the known  models exhibiting apparent algorithmic barriers, the onset of this barrier coincides with the onset of the OGP. The PI intends to investigate this conjecture in the context of several widely studied modern models of high dimensional statistics and machine learning fields, including the Stochastic Block Model, the Spiked Tensor Model, and Wide Neural Networks model. All of these models are known to exhibit an apparent algorithmic hardness in some parameter regimes and thus these models offer a valuable framework for investigating the validity of the aforementioned conjecture, as well as algorithmic intractability implications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Amorphous solids are a category of materials that share the distinction that they do not exhibit any crystal structure. Examples include colloidal pastes, foams, gels, silicate glasses, like window glass and Gorilla(R) glass, and many consumer plastics. This research will lay the groundwork for understanding how these materials respond to stresses and eventually fail so as to guide the use of existing materials as well as the development of new materials. The research focuses on metallic glass as an exemplary amorphous solid. Metallic glasses are an extremely promising emerging class of high strength metallic materials, but their application is limited by their failure mechanisms and the current inability to predict their behavior when subjected to mechanical loads. Improved predictive capabilities are necessary for guiding the design and utilization of failure tolerant metallic glass alloys that will have broad application in medicine, defense and consumer goods. This research will build mathematical descriptions of metallic glasses based on simulations performed on the atomic scale. Computational methods to implement these mathematical descriptions will then be developed so as to estimate both the material behavior and the reliability of the predictions that result. The techniques developed will be broadly disseminated through open source computer codes. Additionally, the project will be integrated with educational research and outreach activities of the investigators, which include broad systemic engagement within Baltimore City elementary schools, improvement of introductory computing education, outreach focused on improving participation of women and URM students at both the high-school and undergraduate levels in engineering research, and public lectures at libraries.<br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research, and education to advance understanding of how amorphous materials fail under mechanical stress. The research team aims to develop physics-based multiscale models of failure processes in amorphous solids, with metallic glass taken as an exemplar material. The physics accessible via atomic scale models of glass structure will be analyzed to obtain statistics of the shear transformation zone defects that control plastic deformation. These will be related to statistical mechanics models of effective temperature that characterize the degree of glass disorder so as to build a constitutive model of plastic deformation. The constitutive model will in turn be incorporated into a high-fidelity 3D viscoplastic finite differencing scheme that adapts techniques originally developed for solving the Navier-Stokes equation. A novel machine learning algorithm will guide the parameterization of the constitutive model from atomistic data so as to inform the continuum method and provide uncertainty quantification. The simulation methods will be pushed to increase the scales on which failure can be modeled by developing a statistical representative-volume element approach incorporating adaptive meshing and resulting in true multiscale simulations of failure in amorphous solids. In doing so, this research is aimed to broadly advance fundamental understanding of how the macroscopic mechanical response of amorphous solid materials is informed by their atomic scale structures. The research will result in the development of methods for making direct connections between atomic scale data and theories applicable on the continuum scale.

The problem is termed as ""variable (or feature) selection"" in regression modeling and statistical learning, and is a long-standing problem in statistics and machine learning. The PI focuses here on the detection of factors that may exert nonlinear and/or interactive effects on the response variable. Recent studies from the PI's group reveal that the sliced inverse regression (SIR) and inverse modeling strategies provide a powerful framework for developing effective variable selection strategies in nonlinear systems of high dimension. The PI aims at developing more robust and effective tools for detecting such complex relationships and studying theoretical properties of SIR-based algorithms. The proposed method will also be applicable to do robust variable selection for classification problems. The proposed theoretical investigations will provide (a) theoretical understanding of limitations of existing dimension-reduction techniques when the dimensionality grows with the sample size; (b) guidance on the construction of necessary sparsity conditions that can guarantee consistency of variable selections in ultra-high dimensional nonlinear problems; (c) the optimal convergence rate of that the best possible learning algorithm can achieve in such settings; and (d) theoretical justifications whether the proposed algorithms can achieve or are not far from the optimality."

Hospital care accounts for about a third of U.S. health care spending. It has been estimated that nearly $30 billion in hospital care costs each year are potentially preventable, with about half of that amount due to hospitalizations related to the two major chronic diseases: heart diseases and diabetes. Electronic Health Records, and the emerging digital data from home-based devices, smart phones, and wearables, offer a great opportunity to develop a systematic approach towards better management of chronic conditions in an outpatient setting and the prevention of hospitalizations required to treat acute episodes resulting from poor control of a patient's condition. This project will utilize digital health data to develop predictive models that anticipate future undesirable events, such as hospitalizations, re-admissions, and transitioning to an acute stage of a disease. These predictions will be used to trigger personalized interventions, ranging from increased monitoring and doctor visits to optimized treatment policies adapted to each patient.

In addition, anomaly detection methods are proposed for shorter-term predictions. Task 2 focuses on interventions seeking to prevent events predicted under Task 1.

This international conference will honor his achievements and expand on his legacy by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate current research challenges and to inspire new lines of inquiry. Image reconstruction plays a crucial role in many aspects of human life such as healthcare, national security, non-destructive testing, and geophysical exploration - all of which will be represented at this conference. Image reconstruction involves the determination of features of an object based on some measured or observed data from the exterior of the object. The measurements are acquired using data from X-rays, pressure waves, sound waves, electric current, etc. The recovery of the object from this data is known as an inverse problem, which is solved using either analytic reconstruction formulas or iterative methods. The conference is structured to provide cross-fertilization between fields and to provide opportunities for senior and junior researchers to interact. This will be promoted at several levels: between subject areas; between prominent and younger researchers; and with a very strong emphasis on discussions between graduate students and established researchers. Graduate students and those new to the field will be encouraged to participate in a poster session in which they will present their research. Diverse groups of faculty and students will be recruited through broad advertising. Results are planned to be disseminated in a special issue of one of the premier journals in the field of inverse problems and, when possible, talks will be posted on the conference website https://math.tufts.edu/faculty/equinto/Cormack2019/.<br/><br/>A large portion of the conference will involve the following topics: X-ray, optical, photo-acoustic, multi-energy, Compton, and multi-spectral tomography.

Along with this, lectures will be given on the theoretical underpinnings of tomography including integral geometry and microlocal reconstruction. Finally, the conference will deal with applications including those in medical, security, and industrial domains. These topics are highly interrelated and the conference will serve as an avenue for researchers to share their insights and results among the different specializations.

The research agenda is structured into three projects. In the first project, the investigator develops methods to infer causal relationships between variables from observational data using the framework of directed Gaussian graphical models combined with tools from optimization and algebraic geometry. The end goal is to apply this new methodology to learn tissue- and person-specific gene regulatory networks from gene expression data such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In the second project, the investigator develops scalable methods for maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian models with linear constraints on the covariance matrix or its inverse. Such models are important for inference of phylogenetic trees or cellular differentiation trees. The third project is an application of graphical models to weather forecasting; the investigator develops new parametric methods based on Gaussian copulas and also non-parametric methods for the post-processing of numerical weather prediction models that take into account the complicated dependence structure of weather variables in space and time."

This removes the requirement for cryogenic optics and vacuum cryostats, greatly reducing system cost and complexity relative to traditional IR imagers with HgCdTe sensors. During each year of a 5-year baseline survey, WINTER will monitor the entire Northern sky to a depth of J=19.2 (single visit), or J=20 (combined), and release calibrated images and transient alerts to the public.

The design of active, stable, earth-abundant catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction would enable effective development of electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries. Similarly, new earth-abundant catalyst materials with high stability, high activity, and high selectivity are required to enable technologies based on aqueous electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions, which can produce hydrogen, methane, methanol, and potentially longer-chain hydrocarbons for use as fuels or specialty chemicals. Catalyst activity is largely governed by surface properties, and the ability to predict and understand, structure-function relationships at realistic catalytic interfaces lies beyond current approaches. This presents a significant challenge to designing such materials.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will address this key challenge by developing a new approach that aims for rapid and accurate prediction of atomic and electronic structure at realistic catalyst-solvent interfaces. The approach, based on a combination of first-principles density functional theory computations, machine learning algorithms, classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, and electrochemical principles will enable the study of environment-structure-property relationships in nanostructured materials in the presence of explicit water molecules, as well as the development of fundamental predictive models to guide the design of new materials systems with tailored properties. These capabilities will be demonstrated in the context of investigating the oxygen evolution reaction, the oxygen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reactions on candidate materials from the promising class of transition metal oxides.<br/>  <br/>This research has the potential to lead to the design of novel water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction catalysts; the development of fundamental insights into oxide interface chemistry; and the dissemination of new computational tools that will enable detailed study and prediction of complex, realistic interface structures with quantum mechanical accuracy. Both the physical insights and the new tools will be directly applicable to the design of tailored materials systems for other catalytic reactions, as well as for a wide variety of other applications, such as photovoltaics, fuel cells and batteries, thermoelectrics, and nanoscale composite materials, in which interfaces play an important role. In addition, the proposed methodology could lead to a new paradigm in high-throughput computational screening of materials systems by enabling materials selection with respect to properties that are directly related to materials incorporation into realistic device geometries.  Computational approaches and the data generated as a result of this research will be made freely available online, providing new opportunities for online education and for accelerating the pathway from materials design to application.

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In statistics, numerical integration is used in virtually all tasks, from parameter inference to model averaging and hypothesis testing.  Among state-of-the-art numerical integration techniques, most methods are randomized algorithms that operate iteratively, generating a sequence of random states, one after the other. Unfortunately, their iterative nature stands at odds with current directions in computing hardware: increasingly parallel architectures and stagnating clock rates.  This research develops new algorithms that provide accurate estimates of integrals as a number of random quantities, that can be generated independently and in parallel, goes to infinity.  The proposed techniques are employed to address long-standing challenges in statistical inference for large models and complex data.  The proposed innovations combine applied probability, computer science and statistical computing, and apply to many fields including machine learning, statistical mechanics, computational neuroscience and epidemiology, where high-dimensional integrals abound.  The project involves the development of software and features an educational program with courses and research opportunities for students, and a broader dissemination program.<br/><br/> <br/>To numerically approximate high-dimensional integrals, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods iteratively generate sequences that explore the landscape described by the integrand. These methods yield estimators that converge to the integrals of interest in the limit of the number of iterations. However, algorithms that rely on iterative asymptotic regimes risk becoming obsolete in the era of parallel computing hardware. The proposed research develops new Monte Carlo estimators that are unbiased for the expectations of interest, while having a finite computing cost and a finite variance. They can thus be generated independently in parallel and averaged over, paving the way for scalable numerical integration on large-scale parallel computers. The proposed estimators rely on faithful couplings of Markov chains, whereby pairs of chains coalesce after a random number of iterations. This project includes theoretical investigations on the efficiency of the proposed estimators, and the design of practical coupling strategies for various applications.  The research connects with topics in numerical methods, stochastic processes and optimal transport. Beyond parallel computing, the proposed estimators are used to tackle statistical challenges such as normalizing constant estimation and modular inference for large models made of multiple components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the ocean, soft-bodied marine animals like cephalopods (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) are naturally endowed with advanced optical organs that enable them to change their skin color almost instantaneously. This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research is to identify and understand the role of pigments and proteins in squid skin, specifically how they combine and contribute to dynamic color sensing and subsequent change. This bottom-up approach will provide a unified biochemical, optical, electrical, and physiological framework describing the adaptive coloration inherent to these marine animals. Results from this work are anticipated to inspire the design of next generation of adaptive and interactive materials that can benefit from new types of pigments and photonic materials derived from and inspired by cephalopods. This award includes an integrative education plan designed to leverage the knowledge, tools, and connections from the proposed research into educational experiences through experiential learning environments beyond the classroom. Specifically, this research will generate exciting visual content from underwater footage of incredible camouflage capability of marine life to bench top material demonstrations that respond dynamically to electrical signals (e.g. music) that will be used to create STEM learning modules focused on materials design for middle and high school classrooms. Beyond the classroom, the PI will develop and launch a seminar series with local female entrepreneurs to engage aspiring female undergraduate and graduate students interested in pursuing translational science. Finally, this research will support increasing participation of females and underrepresented minority groups at the national conferences focused on wearable technologies. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> While cephalopods have been a subject of research for many years, the fundamental physics and chemistry underlying their color modulation is still not well understood, and the reality of creating a material that mimics such outstanding capabilities remains elusive. For instance, a recent study of the cephalopod chromatophore revealed an abundance of lens-crystallin proteins confined within nanostructured pigment granules, indicating a functional convergence between the eyes and skin of the animals that has yet to be explored. This CAREER Award will build off this exciting finding and now investigate the role of these proteins in facilitating signal transduction during camouflage.  Specifically, it will explore the influence of the protein structure on tuning the range of visible color presented by chromatophore and test their role as sensors that regulate a visual feedback loop during camouflage. Through a mechanistic study that tracks the supramolecular assembly of these pigment-protein complexes in vitro, materials design rules will be developed that link the chemical composition to changes in color and pattern. Additionally, the potential of these complexes to behave as opto-electronic nodes evolved to facilitate distributed signaling will also be studied. Together, this multidisciplinary approach will provide a unified biochemical, optical, electrical, and physiological framework for adaptive coloration, providing insights into the development of next generation of adaptive and interactive materials.

Active materials are made from components that can use energy from their local environment to propel themselves. This capability enables active materials to have properties which are not possible in traditional materials. Examples of naturally occurring active materials are found within biological cells, and these materials enable cells to perform functions such as moving, replicating themselves, and healing of wounds. Recent experimental advances are now making it possible to construct artificial active materials, that potentially could have similar capabilities. However, the current theoretical understanding of active materials is incomplete. Improving this theory will guide the design of novel artificial materials, and will help to understand biological processes such as organismal development, cell motility, and cancer growth. <br/><br/>This award will support research aimed at making progress towards such a theory. The PI will develop theoretical and computational models for a recently developed experimental artificial active material made from biological filaments and molecular motor proteins. The models will describe how the system behaves when it is confined in a variety of geometries, such as within channels or spherical droplets. The accuracy of the theoretical and computational models will be assessed by testing model predictions against data from experiments in the same confinement geometries.

Active matter describes intrinsically non-equilibrium materials whose constituent elements consume energy to generate forces and motion. For example, the consumption of ATP by molecules within a biological cell enables it to perform diverse functions such as motion, replication, and self-healing. It is now possible to construct artificial active materials from biomolecules or synthetic colloids which have a similar capability to convert energy to motion. These building blocks could enable a new class of soft materials, with functionalities currently found only in biological organisms. However, the current theoretical understanding of active matter is far from complete. Developing such a theory is crucial to enable rational design of novel artificial active materials, and would elucidate biological processes such as organismal development, cell motility, and cancer growth, and would enable rational design of novel artificial active materials.<br/><br/>This award will support research aimed at progressing toward such a theory, by developing theoretical and computational models motivated by a model active material developed by experimental collaborators - a three-dimensional (3D) ""active nematic"" constructed from a suspension of microtubules and motor proteins. The PI will develop continuum hydrodynamic models of 3D active nematics, and use recently developed numerical methods to solve them in a variety of confinement geometries. The continuum models will be linked to particle-based simulations that probe how energy generated at the particle scale dissipates into larger scale modes. A particular focus of the research will be elucidating the structure of topological defects in 3D, and how they power emergent dynamics. Model predictions will be extensively tested against the experimental 3D active nematics system. The research will build on the current theoretical understanding of active matter by overcoming the following limitations: (1) Most real-world applications require 3D materials, but to date almost all controllable experimental active systems have been 2D or quasi-2D. Thus, the current theoretical understanding of active matter is largely limited to 2D. (2) While boundaries can usually be neglected in an equilibrium theory, they have profound, long-ranged effects on active matter. Thus, models for active matter must treat boundaries explicitly and with appropriate boundary conditions. (3) Energy input at the particle scale in an active system cascades continuously to larger scales, making it difficult to identify a separation of scales that can be exploited to simplify theoretical descriptions. Thus, models that link the microscale force generation units to large-scale descriptions of collective behaviors are needed. <br/><br/>The supported research will provide valuable science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) training for undergraduate and graduate students at the interface between mathematical methods and theoretical and experimental soft matter physics.

Materials such as sand, glasses, foams and colloids can become rigid or jam as the density is increased.

These properties are due to their structure: particles in a jammed state have only the minimum number of neighbors required to hold them in place. <br/><br/>The PI will investigate how the jamming process is altered when it occurs in a system that is changing shape, such as on a fluid droplet or an elastic body.

The PI will develop a computational model of jamming in flexible geometries and use it to determine how particles and initial shape affect the structure and how desired final shapes can be sculpted by carefully choosing the components of the system. By incorporating particles in the simulation that respond to external influences, such as in response to an applied field, or move under their own power, the research team will determine how these particles can be used to create shape-shifting materials that can change shape spontaneously.

Jamming is a transition to rigidity that occurs in granular media. The goal of the research is to understand by computer simulations how the jamming transition is modified when it occurs in a flexible geometry. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that jammed states in flexible geometries constitute a new jamming category called ""metric jammed"" where the system is stable both with respect to collective motions of the surface and deformations of the manifold. Understanding how physical effects such as jamming are modified when shape and order co-evolve provides fundamental insight into these processes and will enable the creation of new materials, devices and industrial techniques such as soft robotics, drug delivery systems, actuators and artificial muscles that exploit the results. <br/><br/>To test the central hypothesis, the PI will create a computational model of the metric jamming process and use this to: i) determine how shape and particles control the properties of the metric jammed state; ii) identify how flexible geometries affect metric jamming and how this can be used to sculpt soft colloidal particles of a desired shape; iii) incorporate actuatable and active particles into the model to determine how such particles can be used to create shape-shifting materials that can change shape spontaneously. This work will help advance the field of soft matter by providing a detailed understanding of the physics of the new metric jammed state in both two and three dimensions, the connections between order and shape change, the shapes that can emerge from these processes, and how microstructural changes can induce shape evolution. To help others navigate the numerous and complex physical effects intrinsic to this class of materials, the research will also provide open-source computational tools to facilitate this design.<br/><br/>This award also supports outreach and education efforts that are closely integrated with the research.

These forces themselves exhibit weak fluctuations whose magnitude, and relevance will be explored, in particular for bodies at different temperatures.<br/><br/>This research activity is closely incorporated in seminars and courses of the PI which through his published textbooks and web-pages reach a broad scientific community. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, and has had impact in diverse areas from applied mathematics to immunology.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education that pursues consequences of fluctuations. Quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are the cornerstone of quantum and statistical physics. Precision measurements of heat transfer and Casimir forces at sub-micron scale have made possible probing these phenomena at unprecedented detail. Thus, developing theoretical tools for treatment of systems out of thermal equilibrium, where concepts such as entropy and free energy are inapplicable, is of particular relevance. This research is aimed at developing and refining methods, based on scattering theory and so-called fluctuational QED, to characterize novel features of these forces, especially in the non-equilibrium contexts of objects held at different temperatures, or in relative motion.<br/>Interestingly, there are conceptual connections to the very different system of collections of self-propelled active particles. Due to conservation laws, say of the number of particles, fluctuations in driven matter acquire long-range correlations and exhibit long-range interactions akin to Casimir forces. Using a combination of numerical and analytical methods, this project will explore patterns and forces in driven classical particles. The numerical studies shall focus on simple lattice models, such as Active Brownian Particles or Driven Diffusive Systems, with sufficient complexity to capture collective behaviors. On the analytical front, methods of statistical field theory, used on symmetries and conservation laws to construct stochastic equations for active matter, and stress tensors to compute force, shall be employed."

Cao and coworkers develop new theoretical and computational methods to analyze coherent energy transfer in photosynthetic systems. Photosynthesis is the biological process that converts solar energy into biomass. The first step of this process involves the capture of photons (particles of light) by arrays of light-harvesting complexes.  These photons excite electrons in the complexes.  This excitation energy is transferred to the reaction center for subsequent conversion to chemical energy. The energy transfer process in photosynthesis exhibits remarkable efficiency.  There is   extensive basic research to understand the basis of this efficiency.  This research provides useful insight into the optimal design of artificial light-harvesting devices. In the past, these design efforts attempted to mimic photosynthesis based on the idea that the excitation energy is transferred from pigment molecules to the reaction center by hopping down the molecular energy ladder, one molecule at a time. However, recent experimental evidence reveals a crucial role for quantum coherence and for cooperative effects. These new findings raise fundamental questions that inspire the proposed theoretical and computational developments. While addressing these questions, Prof. Cao devotes significant efforts to training students and postdoctoral associates in his group, compiling new course materials on MIT OpenCourseWare for public access, and further developing an open website for the distribution of simulation codes. <br/><br/><br/>Arguably the most subtle quantum mechanical effect, quantum coherence has no simple classical analog but lies at the root of diffraction, interference, delocalization, and quantum entanglement. Evidently, nature takes advantage of subtle coherence effects in the optimal design of photosynthetic systems to effectively convert photons into chemical bonds. It is, however, unclear how the coherence effects can facilitate the remarkably efficient and robust energy transfer in photosynthesis and how quantum coherence can be properly defined, measured, and controlled. To address these questions, Jianshu Cao develops an active research program by integrating polaron theory, stochastic simulations, and experimental collaborations. Specifically, the research plan consists of three components: (i) theoretical and conceptual issues centered on quantum coherence; (ii) a unified stochastic formalism for simulating coherent exciton dynamics; and (iii) applications to light-harvesting structures in natural photosynthetic systems and in artificial energy devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional synthetic materials do not display such properties because they are composed of inanimate molecules. In contrast, biological systems consist of active, energy transducing molecules which continuously push and pull on each other, producing active stresses. These active stresses make biological systems examples of active matter, and are ultimately are responsible for many of their unusual behaviors. Creating artificial active matter opens up a new route towards constructing materials with lifelike functionalities. However, a significant obstacle to realizing this possibility is an absence of understanding of how active stresses are produced: given specific elemental building blocks, there are not currently tools to either measure or theoretically predict the magnitude, type, or even the sign of the active stresses. The project will elucidate the foundational principles of active stress generation using a synergistic combination of experiments, simulations, and theory. The work will result in the creation of new experimental tools for measuring active stresses, new synthesis procedures for creating active materials, and new multi-scale modeling techniques for studying active matter.

First is the development of tools to measure active stresses at different length scales using optical tweezers, fluid flow measurements, microfluidics, and 3D printing, in combination with theory and simulations. Second, a novel system will be created in which active stress generation will be modulated by directly affixing kinesin-14 to microtubules in predetermined patterns. Theory and simulations will be used to guide which patterns to create, and conversely, measuring the resulting active stress generation in these designed materials will provide a stringent test of theory and simulations. Third, a multi-scale modeling framework will be developed and tested. These will be subsequently related to each other through a combination of analytical calculations and simulations.

Organic materials are a highly tunable class of optically active materials that are promising for photovoltaics and artificial photosynthesis. The field of organic chemistry can synthesize molecular assemblies with a great degree of precision; however, understanding needed to design these systems for efficient energy transfer is lacking. Theory and computation will be used to develop a deeper physical intuition about the excited-states of organic materials. This project focuses on the role of long-range order on the optical properties of organic molecules in the condensed phase. The PI and research team will employ first-principles electronic structure theory to better understand how optically excited states within ordered organic assemblies can be controlled to deliver improved photovoltaic and photocatalytic efficiency. <br/><br/>The determination of structure-property relationships is critical for the design of new molecules; the PI and her research team will quantify aspects of the optically excited state, such as the interaction of excitons with phonons, which significantly impacts energy transfer and conversion but is challenging to understand and quantify. Furthermore, these studies will shed light on the behavior of electron-hole pairs in systems where excitonic effects are strong. Additionally, new computational methodology will be developed for probing the role of electron-phonon interactions, which are very difficult to characterize in extended systems. Feedback from experimental collaborators aiming to validate the predictions will be used to improve the computational approach, and thereby increasing the impact of this research.

Social insects, those that form cooperative societies with specialized castes based on division of labor, for example, afford spectacular examples of collective behavior in such instances as termite mounds, locust swarms and bee clusters and hives. These collective architectures are functional and allow the organisms to maintain a relatively uniform micro-environment even with a variable macro-environment. Understanding how this is achieved in a variety of climates and environments is not just a problem in ecology or physiology, but also one in physics, given that they exchange information, energy and matter continually with the environment. The study looks at the collective dynamics of bee colonies that maintain their temperature in a closed environment using active ventilation driven by fanning, and the structural dynamics of actively adherent bee clusters that can respond to vibrotactile stimuli by changing their shape. While current studies in active matter primarily focus on the patterns in space and time that result from interactions, the new experimental and theoretical approaches will focus on how active systems can perform functions by coupling form, flows and forces in the presence of feedback. Organisms live in varying environments and must therefore be able to tolerate variations in the macro-environment they inhabit. They do this by creating niches that damp out the large scale variations without completely isolating themselves. Outside human societies, nowhere is this better seen than in social insects. The current study takes a quantitative physical approach to the problem, building on the empirical information obtained by biologists. It aims to partially break down the artificial barrier between physics and biology, i.e. between non-living and living matter by showing how living matter shapes itself and its physical non-living environment to achieve function. By synthesizing aspects of hydrodynamics, statistical mechanics and decision making for active matter systems, the research will thus have impact on a range of biological and engineered systems where behavior and decision making come together with flows and forces.<br/><br/>The collective behavior of the organisms creates environmental micro-niches that buffer them from environmental fluctuations e.g. temperature, humidity, mechanical perturbations etc., thus coupling organismal physiology, environmental physics and population ecology. The current study proposes to use a combination of biological experiments, theory, computation and robotic biomimicry to understand how a collective of bees can integrate physical and behavioral cues to attain a non-equilibrium steady state that allows them to resist and respond to environmental fluctuations of forces and flows. The researchers will analyze how bee clusters change their shape and connectivity and gain stability by spread-eagling themselves in response to mechanical perturbations, using a combination of optical and x-ray imaging techniques. Similarly, the researchers will study how bees in a colony respond to environmental thermal perturbations by deploying a fanning strategy at the entrance that they use to create a forced ventilation stream that allows the bees to collectively maintain a constant hive temperature. When combined with quantitative analysis and computations in both systems, the researchers will integrate the sensing of the environmental cues (acceleration, temperature, flow) and convert them to behavioral outputs that allow the swarms to achieve a dynamic homeostasis, that will be tested using collective robotics using simple agents that can sense each other, their environment and move in response to both cues."

At the heart of general relativity lies Einstein's field equation which relates the curvature of spacetime to its energy/matter content. Solutions of this equation describe astrophysical phenomena such as black hole and gravitational waves. The primary goal of this project is a precise description of the dynamics of black holes which are out of equilibrium: as time evolves, they are expected to settle down to a stationary black hole under emission of gravitational waves. Attaining this goal requires the development of novel mathematical tools in microlocal analysis and spectral theory. In a nutshell, the main principle of microlocal analysis is to keep track simultaneously of the position and the momentum (or frequency) of a propagating wave. Spectral theory, in this context, is concerned with the characteristic frequencies and amplitudes of waves surrounding an almost stationary black hole. The problems under investigation are closely connected to recent advances in astrophysics. The gravitational waves emitted by a dynamical black hole were recently detected experimentally; their frequencies and amplitudes contain a large amount of information about the properties of the black hole, such as its mass and angular momentum. Directly motivated by the experimental detection of the merging of binary black holes, the investigator furthermore aims to initiate the mathematical study of the interaction of several black holes. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The nonlinear stability problem of the Kerr family of black hole spacetimes has been a driving force behind the development of the modern theory of wave equations on curved spacetimes. The investigator will study this problem for slowly rotating black holes by combining recent advances in spectral theory and dynamical systems with novel microlocal tools. This will in particular require a significant extension of the set of tools developed for the analysis of elliptic partial differential equations on compactified/singular spaces to the hyperbolic setting. Using similar techniques, the investigator will analyze the sharp asymptotic behavior of solutions of linear wave equations, including the Maxwell and Klein-Gordon equations, on black hole spacetimes. Moreover, the investigator will consider problems related to proving quasinormal mode expansions and ringdown for black holes settling down to their equilibrium state, motivated by recent experimental observations of gravitational waves. The investigator plans to relate the decay rate of spacetime metrics towards equilibrium in the exterior of black holes to their regularity near the inner black hole horizon in the context of Penrose?s Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture. The second part of this project concerns the construction of multi-black hole spacetimes. In particular, on cosmological spacetimes, the investigator proposes to construct vacuum spacetimes in which the black holes are eventually out of causal contact. The third part concerns inverse problems for passive and active measurements for nonlinear wave equations in settings in which the inverse problem for the corresponding linear equation has not been solved yet. The investigator plans to use the nonlinear interaction of waves deep inside of an object of interest in order to create artificial waves which carry information about the object back to its surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two measurements are made using different regions of the galaxy's spectrum.  This work will determine how the numbers are related, and whether there are meaningful causal connections.  This is essential to understanding how reliably these sorts of studies can actually derive physical parameters for the observed galaxies.  The project has an integrated educational component: (1) summer research opportunities for undergraduate students from the surrounding area, exposing them to cutting-edge research; and (2) research experiences for teachers from local middle and elementary schools, helping to align them with the new ""content driven"" testing standards set by the State of Massachusetts, and with the requirements of the national Next Generation Science Standards.<br/><br/>The synergy between ALMA and JWST will return the star formation rate (SFR) and gas mass (M_gas) of galaxies across the full range of luminosity and physical parameters at high redshifts, thus shedding light on the efficiency of star formation and the growth of galaxies as a function of cosmic time.  Commonly, the SFR is derived from the ""blue"" side of the infrared spectral energy distribution (IR SED) of the dust, while M_gas is derived from the ""red"" side of the IR SED. However, the dichotomy between ""blue"" and ""red"" sides is artificial, and IR colors and monochromatic luminosities show correlations with each other.  If there are underlying covariances, then they may be either helpful or detrimental to the use of the IR SED for deriving physical parameters.  This project will determine such covariances, including their strengths, and establish whether they are physical (causal correlations) or trivial (such as some common cause) in nature.  Bayesian inference methods applied to the ALMA and other archives will uncover and investigate covariances, to (1) investigate the correlation between mid-IR and far-IR/mm colors in a sample of nearby galaxies; (2) establish how well, and under what assumptions, physical models of dust emission account for the observed color-color correlation; and (3) establish whether the IR SED color-color correlation implies covariance between luminosities.  The results will provide prescriptions for application to high redshift galaxies, specifically, recipes for deriving unbiased SFRs and M_gas from the IR SED and for extrapolating missing IR SED data in distant galaxies where issues of completeness, depth, and confusion become important.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A scientific challenge of the 21st century is to harness the unique features of quantum mechanics for new technologies. For example, a computer that works on the basis of quantum logic would offer speed-ups and other advantages when compared with familiar classical computers, at least for some nearly intractable computational problems. Another type of machine called a quantum annealer can be used to solve optimization problems. While not a full-fledged quantum computer, a quantum annealer uses tunneling and entanglement during its operation, and its advantages over conventional machines is a topic of much current research. This project will attempt to show that the restrictions present in current quantum annealers mean that these machines are not yet sufficiently quantum mechanical to provide a fundamental computational advantage over conventional computation methods. If successful, this work will make clear that proposed modifications to current annealers, which are technologically feasible, are necessary for these devices to provide useful improvements over conventional computing approaches. If this claim is not proven, this work may provide insights into when current quantum annealers can be expected to outperform conventional computers.<br/><br/>Quantum computation promises advantages over classical computation for certain problems. However, the experimental obstacles to the construction of a large scale quantum computer are formidable. Quantum annealing is an intermediate approach to obtaining some quantum advantage, and over the last decade it has been implemented on a reasonably large scale. Quantum annealers solve optimization problems, and there is experimental evidence for quantum effects such as tunneling and entanglement during their operation. A general theory of when these machines provide a quantum advantage is absent, but because of the existence of actual hardware a large body of empirical knowledge is accumulating about their operation. This work will address whether they can provide a uniquely quantum advantage over classical approaches. The project will address the following question for quantum annealers: Is there a local hidden variable theory that describes the operation of all current quantum annealing hardware?  Theoretical tools to address this question include Wigner functions for discrete systems that give a description in terms of quasi-probabilities that sum to one, but which may be negative. When all the quasi-probabilities associated with states, operations and measurements are positive, the system admits a completely classical hidden variable description. This team will investigate whether such a positive, classical description can be accurate for quantum annealers."

The four color map theorem was first proved in 1976 by Appel and Haken; the proof involved a huge amount of case checking, so much so that the only feasible method of attack was via computer.  This machine-assisted proof, however, cannot be directly checked by a human.  Although there have been some subsequent simplifications and clarifications, the general brute-force approach has seemed to be the only line of attack.  The four color theorem can be rephrased, though, as a question about the topology of three-dimensional manifolds, and in particular new tools inspired by high energy physics give novel ways to approach a conceptual proof of the four color theorem.  This project explores and develops these new insights.<br/><br/>The principal investigator and collaborator define a version of instanton Floer homology for trivalent graphs embedded in three-manifolds. This theory enables them to place the four color map theorem firmly in the context of gauge-theory-inspired invariants of three-manifolds. They have proved a fundamental non-vanishing theorem for this Floer homology group, reducing the four color map theorem to a question about computing this invariant for general planar graphs.  They are developing new tools for the computation of these and related invariants, and they have discovered a spectral sequence relevant to this computation.  The collapse of the spectral sequence for planar graphs would imply the four color theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental components of an HMM include the noisy observations and the corresponding hidden states. In most applications, the number of hidden states (the order of the HMM) is not known beforehand but conveys important information about the underlying process. For example, in molecular biology, the total number of hidden states may be the number of distinct 3D conformations of a protein; in chemistry, the total number of hidden states may be the number of distinct chemical species in an organic reaction. This project plans to investigate order determination for HMMs, finite mixture models, and hierarchical HMMs; the latter two models are special cases and extensions of HMMs. The project aims to develop a consistent and competitive method for order selection. In addition to a thorough theoretical investigation, comprehensive numerical studies and applications in biology and chemistry will be conducted. The project will not only significantly advance the theoretical understanding of HMMs, but also provide powerful tools for researchers to analyze data. The data applications will help advance molecular biology and biochemistry. The project also aims to support and train undergraduate and graduate students, with special attention being given to recruiting students from under-represented groups into statistics and related fields. Education at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be integrated into the research activities. <br/><br/>The project will establish the marginal likelihood method as a consistent and competitive order selection method for HMMs, finite mixture models, and hierarchical HMMs. Five research studies will be carried out, enumerated as follows. (1) Investigate the order of HMMs, where the goal is to identify and develop consistent methods for HMM order determination. (2) Investigate order selection issues in finite mixture models. Finite mixture models can be reformulated as special types of HMMs. The goal is to develop a method for consistently estimating the number of mixture components. (3) Investigate order determination of hierarchical HMMs, where multiple HMMs are linked through a hierarchical structure. The aim here is to identify and develop consistent methods for determining the order of hierarchical HMMs, taking special effort to address the challenging issue that multiple HMMs often have quite diverse characteristics, such as lengths. (4) Study computational challenges and investigate and implement efficient computational methods for the order determination of HMM and related models, including the implementation and release of an open source, publicly available R package. (5) Apply the new method to ion channel data and single-molecule data on co-translational protein targeting. The PI also plans to develop courses that introduce and guide students in HMMs, mixture models, and hierarchical HMMs. The success of the proposed research will develop a theoretical basis and associated methodology for consistent order determination of HMMs and related models. The research achievements and the education components will broadly impact the analysis of HMMs, hierarchical HMMs, and model selection and also help train a new generation of scholars and researchers in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some assumptions rightfully reflect past experience, present consensus, or future speculations. Others are imposed solely due to limitations of the investigation methods.  Useful information in practice often comes in a vague, ""low-resolution"" form, like a blurred picture, both literally and figuratively. Currently, statistical models have largely relied on overly precise model structures, built upon a mix of sound scientific knowledge and some less verifiable assumptions. As models grow larger to accommodate the ever-growing volume and variety of data, statistical inference is faced with the pressing need to accurately and honestly express all types of low-resolution knowledge. Without adequate tools to deal with vague information, investigators are forced to concoct high-resolution assumptions that can neither be trusted nor invalidated in meaningful ways, the culprit in the ongoing crisis of irreplicable research. This project aims to provide scientists and statisticians both a theoretical framework and practical methods to tackle this challenge without having to abandon familiar probabilistic rules and tools, thereby strengthening the effort in reducing irreplicable scientific findings. <br/><br/>The need to reduce unwanted assumptions in scientific and statistical studies has led to an extensive literature on imprecise probability (IP), or more broadly, soft methods in probability and statistics (SMPS). As of today, both have received little attention from the statistics community, which generally equivocates on anything that does not obey precise probabilistic rules. This project demonstrates that both the precise probability and hard statistical principles have much to offer for studying IP and SMPS, with the fundamental realization that once going beyond precise probabilities, the learning rules by which we update the imprecise model must become the vehicle for implicit assumptions, explaining some paradoxes and puzzles that arise in IP and SMPS.  With a clearer understanding of what IP/SMPS can and cannot do, the proposed research contributes in theoretical and practical ways to ensure and enhance replicability of scientific studies that rely on probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis.<br/>The initial idea of this project stemmed from the PI's realization that in handling low-resolution information, the well-accepted Heitjan-Rubin framework for data coarsening in the literature of missing data induces essentially the same mathematical structure as does the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief function. Consequently, belief function can be understood and studied using ordinary probability. The proposed research explores this link and extensions to its variations, and aims to provide (1) a precise probabilistic formulation of belief function, which offers both insights and questions for the Dempster-Shafer theory, especially Dempster's Rule of Combination; (2) a detailed comparison and contrast of three learning rules for updating and propagating low-resolution information, especially with respect to the phenomena of dilation, contraction, and sure loss; and (3) an exploration of the design and implementation of efficient, MCMC-type algorithms for learning rules of low-resolution inference, in parallel to MCMC for Bayesian inference. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to enhance the scientists' and statisticians' toolkit for conducting more objective inference and data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By this method, nearly 200 simple molecules (such as water and ammonia) have been identified in our Milky Way galaxy.  In this research, scientists will make careful laboratory measurements of new molecules that could be detected by radio telescopes.   They will make very precise measurements of the molecules' signature, then go to telescopes to search for these signals in space.   The scientists will search for these molecules by observing clouds of gas surrounding stars which blow carbon, oxygen and other elements off their outer layers.  Molecules form as the gas from stars cool, and some of these molecules subsequently accumulate and form clumps called 'dust'.  These scientists will learn what types of molecules are formed in space around these stars. They are particularly interested in molecules familiar on Earth but which are unknown in space, like silicon oxides (e.g. sand), aluminum oxide (the white film on unpainted aluminum) and titanium oxide (the white color in paint and active component in sunscreen).  Some of these oxides of silicon, aluminum, and titanium are thought to be the building blocks of the dust that ultimately forms planets outside our own Solar System.<br/><br/>This research begins with laboratory measurements of rotational spectra of new complex molecules containing either two or three silicon, aluminum, or titanium atoms.  These molecules are more complex than those previously measured.  Next radio astronomers will unravel the chemistry in the inner envelopes of late-type carbon- and oxygen-rich evolved stars, which are a major source of planet forming dust. <br/><br/>Owing to many uncertainties in the chemical models of these sources, it is only through an empirical approach, which entails an integrated program of laboratory measurements and astronomical observations at high angular resolution and sensitivity, that astronomers may understand these complex regions. The molecules will be produced in widely used laboratory sources (either glow discharge, discharge nozzle, or laser ablation); their rotational spectra will be measured in the centimeter, millimeter, and sub-millimeter bands either with a Fabry-Perot cavity, broadband chirped pulse spectrometer, or non-resonant absorption cell; and the spectra will be analyzed with standard Hamiltonians and computer programs.<br/><br/>The search for the new molecular species in the laboratory will be guided by high level quantum chemical calculations of the structures which will be done by our expert collaborators, and will draw on 30 years of work on reactive molecules of astrophysical interest by our group. In addition to the contribution of this work to astronomy, direct detection of elusive titanium oxides, aluminum oxides, and silicon-bearing molecules in the laboratory will provide detailed information about their structures, which in turn will help applied physicists address vexing questions about the elementary reactions that govern the growth and their wide range of photo-catalytic and photovoltaic applications.<br/><br/>This research combines chemistry, electronics, physics and astronomy and is as an excellent topic for teaching, training, and learning. The outreach plan is two-pronged: (1) Provide mentorship and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students through programs at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and Harvard; and (2) Create a spectral line molecular radio astronomy module for an innovative learning tool, called 'Spectral Explorer'.  <br/><br/>The Spectral Explorer is a browser-based spectra visualization and analysis tool.  The Spectral Explorer will be used in both high school classroom and public outreach learning settings.  The SAO Science Education Department (SED) is developing these events. As part of this effort, the SAO spectroscopy laboratory will be actively engaged in the planning and execution of specific tutorials, videos, spectral datasets, and case study resources which will be centered on the research described in this proposal. The Spectral Explorer lab will be disseminated via partnerships with the NSF, NASA and Smithsonian Affiliations networks to the ten thousand educators currently using SED resources and to the more than 50,000 public/citizen science users."

The workshops will contribute toward addressing the considerable shortage of high school physics educators in every state in the U.S., even though enrollments in high school physics have been steadily increasing since the 1980s. In addition to a shortage of high school physics teachers in the U.S. and increased student enrollments, less than half of high school physics courses in the U.S. are taught by an educator with a physics degree. The short-term goals are to provide access to relevant evidence-based teaching practices to transform high school physics curricula, as well as to strengthen partnerships between high school teachers, their professional peers, and leading physics education researchers. Workshop partnerships have the potential to spark novel ideas for curricular interventions and potential interventions that could inform scaled up initiatives. Workshop participants will also have the option of participating in a research study focused on understanding current challenges for physics high school teachers. In addition to improving physics high school curriculum the second aim is to better understand how to overcome challenges faced by high school teachers and to develop partnerships between high school educators and higher education experts to increase the number of students who have access to a quality physics education. As a result of bringing these different communities into a single workshop, the set of diverse perspectives will be a source of innovation focused at solving challenges that go beyond access to physics education and affect STEM success at the university level, long-term.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the workshops is provided by the emphasis on expert leaders in the learning sciences, educational researchers, and physics education researchers.

The PI plans to incorporate peer-to-peer learning to start discussions amongst workshop participants and also plans to collect, analyze, and disseminate their curricular redesigns. The participants will help the workshop community identify the challenges that need to be addressed given the increases in student demands for access to physics high school classrooms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is cofunded by the BioMaps program and funds from the ENG/CBET/BBBE program. At present, new drugs are developed by screening hundreds of possible candidates against cancer cells grown on plastic surfaces.  Drugs that show potential are further tested in animals, and anywhere from zero to a handful of candidates could make it through this process, where they are then taken to clinical trials. Drug candidates that appear successful in cells on the plastic surfaces often fail in clinical trials. Overall, this process is long and not cost effective. The biomaterials that are being studied have potential use in understanding how cancer cells respond to drugs in an environment that mimics human tissue, and thereby overcomes some of the drawbacks of the present approaches. With this award, the PI plans to develop new educational opportunities for students from high school to graduate levels. High school students, especially women will be trained in the PI's laboratory during the summer months, where these students can learn how to do cell culture and 3D printing techniques and to observe how cells move and grow on different material surfaces. Undergraduate students will be trained in creating new pathways to take ownership and authorship of their learning experience, resulting in educational modules that can be used across the nation. At the graduate level, the focus will be in recruiting highly capable students from underrepresented groups across the nation to become the next leading scientists working at the interface of materials and biology. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The ability of cells to resist chemotherapy impacts cancer patients around the globe. A core problem of the current drug screening techniques that utilize plastic multi-well plates is that it fails to account for a cell's native material microenvironment. This CAREER project will take a transformative approach to drug screening by quantifying cancer cell responses to drugs in a biomaterial platform mimicking the rapidly evolving material properties of the tumor microenvironment, specifically a material microenvironment that is continually remodeled by resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This proposal will use a high-throughput biomaterial platform to determine how three dimensional matrix stiffness, integrin binding, and soluble growth factors and cytokines impact cancer cell response to drugs. The underlying hypothesis is that physical and biochemical cues from an MSC-remodeled extracellular matrix (ECM) interfere with the efficacy small molecule drugs, and that targeting the MSCs, not the cancer cells, can halt this drug resistance. The results from this proposal would transform our fundamental understanding of the role that the physical environment plays in interfering with small molecule drugs. The PI will leverage CAREER funding to increase educational opportunities in bioengineering at three levels: high school, undergraduate, and graduate. The PI has already created a new summer laboratory program at University of Massachusetts at Amherst that teaches high school students cell culture and advanced microscopy techniques.  Over the next few years, the PI plans to create new educational modules for undergraduate students that are specifically aimed at self-directed learning techniques and fostering creativity and teamwork in the classroom.  Additionally, the PI plans to expand recruiting efforts nationwide, in collaboration with the Diversity Institute at the campus, to bring more qualified students from underrepresented groups to campus, and train them to become the future leaders in science and engineering."

The ultimate goal of the work is the discovery of design principles for the construction of molecular machines and molecular-sized devices that can more easily integrate with existing technologies.  A goal is to gain a better understanding of molecular motion.  Control of molecular motion is crucial for the design of new approaches for unique new applications, including tiny molecular-sized pumps, sensors, and optoelectronics. To engage broad audiences in this project, the Sykes research team gives presentations about nanoscienceat local high schools with newly developed demonstrations.  YouTube videos featuring the project results are produced. The group has developed a Science Fair between Tufts and Medford High which enables ~300 students per year to interact with graduate researchers about their science project presentations.<br/><br/>Single molecule devices are capable of performing a number of functions from mechanical motion to simple computation.  Their utility is somewhat limited, however, by difficulties associated with coupling them with either each other or with interfaces such as electrodes.  This project takes a new approach using molecular self-assembly to produce 2D crystalline arrays of molecular rotors that display emergent properties like correlated rotational switching.  The arrays are synthesized by the Ullmann reaction of precursor molecular rotors with a Cu (111) surface, yielding 2D networks of metal-organic complexes in which the rotary units can interact with each other.  Scanning tunneling microscopy enables excitation of the individual rotor groups and the ability to study how reorientation of an individual molecular rotor affects its neighbors.  By studying the effect of voltage, current, and tunneling gap distance on rotor motion, the mechanism of excitation will be explored.  Altering the size and functionality of the precursor molecules enables control over the placement of the rotor units in the 2D molecular crystals and the ability to study the effect of rotor-rotor spacing and angle on correlated rotational switching.  By changing the functionality of the rotor itself, both steric and dipolar coupling will be explored.  Finally, chiral rotary units will be introduced as a way to induce unidirectional rotation via a flashing temperature ratchet-like mechanism."

PISCO is a professional astronomical camera mounted on the 6.5 meter Clay Telescope.  PISCO has a novel design that allows it to take pictures in four different colors at the same time with four large CCD detectors over a piece of the sky about 1/10th the size of the moon.  While the unique design of PISCO has made it useful for many astronomical discoveries, the principal project for which PISCO was built is follow-up of clusters of galaxies discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT is the most sensitive and highest-resolution telescope in the world for observing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation that arises in the early Universe.   Because the space between galaxies in clusters is filled with hot plasma gas, galaxy clusters appear as a dark spots in front of the CMB.  This is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.  Among the discoveries by the SPT so far are 530 galaxy clusters, and with a newly-installed highly-sensitive detector called SPT-3G, it will discover thousands more.  When the SPT discovers a galaxy cluster, all that is known about it is its location and the size of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich spot, so follow-up observations by an optical telescope are needed.  Some of those galaxy clusters will appear in existing optical sky surveys, but others will be too faint to appear or will be outside the survey area -- those galaxy clusters will be followed-up by PISCO in this project.  The number and distribution of galaxy clusters provides information about the nature and history of Dark Energy, the mysterious force that dominates the Universe.  Furthermore, PISCO may contribute to improving our knowledge of the mass of neutrinos via ""weak lensing"" measurements of the mass of the clusters. The determination of the mass of neutrino species has been identified as an important next step in particle physics, an advance that may have wide-reaching impacts on physics and technology, including nuclear physics here on Earth.  The Southern MicroObservatory will be part of a network of automated telescopes that can be controlled over the Internet (mo-www.cfa.harvard.edu). The telescopes are designed to enable youth nationwide to investigate the wonders of the deep sky from their classrooms or after-school centers.  This project will support the installation of a robotic MicroObservatory telescope at Las Campanas and integrate it with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Science Education Department Robotic Telescope Network for the online STEM learning community. The maintenance effort will be efficiently shared with PISCO operations.<br/><br/>The South Pole Telescope consortium has completed the SPT-SZ and SPTPOL surveys and is now engaged in the SPT-3G deep millimeter-wave continuum survey that will detect thousands of previously-unknown galaxy clusters and groups through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. PISCO observations will play a key role in the production of a mass-limited redshift-independent catalog of galaxy clusters over ~9% of the sky. This searchable public database will include imaging as well as spectroscopy in the optical, infrared, and X-ray, enabling a wide variety of scientific studies. In this project, the SPT consortium will conduct multi-wavelength follow-up of the new SPT-3G survey in order to complete the SPT Cluster Legacy Archive.  This three-year program will produce photometric and spectroscopic catalogs of volume complete samples of galaxy clusters over a 4000 square degree area of sky. After analyzing candidate cluster positions in existing survey data such as DES and VISTA, the SPT team will: (1) make the additional photometric imaging observations needed for completeness in redshift and mass limit, (2) obtain weak lensing measurements during periods of excellent seeing for a representative (albeit still large) subsample of these clusters, (3) make these evolving data sets promptly available to the astronomical and STEM learning communities in both raw and reduced form, through publications and a web-accessible, searchable archive, and (4) analyze the data for cosmology and the determination of neutrino properties.  The formation of clusters and groups of galaxies is a battle between the gravitational attraction of Dark Matter, the dynamics of relativistic and non-relativistic particles, and the repulsive effect of Dark Energy. Their abundance over cosmic time is a sensitive probe of cosmology that complements and refines other cosmological tests. The redshift-independent archive of ~ 8000 confirmed clusters in this project will be the foundation for profound enhancements in our understanding of (a) fundamental properties of the Universe, including greatly improved constraints on the mass and number of neutrino species and the nature and history of Dark Energy out to z ~ 2, and (b) the astrophysics of galaxy clusters and their intracluster medium, the evolution of galaxies and their constituent stellar populations in high-density environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop statistical methods for analyzing data resulting in new scientific, sociological, and biomedical discoveries. The research has several fundamental challenges due to the features of the data: (1) large scale, which requires advanced strategies on storage, computation, and quality control; (2) a complicated structure, which makes careful statistical modeling a critical need; and (3) strong noise, which requires sophisticated de-noising techniques. To address these challenges, the PI proposes a universal probabilistic factor modeling approach. The research will provide an array of statistical tools for social network analysis, natural language processing, RNA-sequencing data analysis, and electronic health records analysis.  This project will also help train graduate and undergraduate students on data collection, data cleaning, statistical methodology and theory. In addition, this project will release new software and data sets for network and text analysis providing useful resources for both education and research.  <br/><br/>Probabilistic factor models refer to factor models whose factors or factor loadings are connected to probability mass functions. Examples include the topic models in text mining and mixed membership models in social networks. Due to the nonnegative constraints and the dependent and heteroscedastic noise in these models, statistical estimation and inference are extremely challenging. This project will tackle these challenges and apply the proposed methods to different applications. The first thrust aims to develop a novel framework for exploring sparsity in topic models. It proposes a new notion of ""sparsity"" on the vocabulary, which is different from the conventional notion of sparsity in high-dimensional statistics. The framework will provide a theoretical foundation for dimension reduction in text mining, as well as new word screening methods and new spectral methods for topic weight estimation. The second thrust aims to study the fundamental statistical limits for network mixed membership estimation. It will lead to a new optimality theory of mixed membership estimation, especially for network models with a large degree of heterogeneity, and new random matrix theory for empirical eigenvectors. It will also produce data sets about the networks among academic researchers in statistics-related fields and generate discoveries about the trend and patterns in academic research. The third thrust aims to adapt the above technical tools to biomedical data, including bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data and electronic health care data. It will result in new mixture models and statistical inference tools for biomedical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Frank Keutsch of Harvard University and his students investigate the fundamental processes involved in separating compounds between the air and the surface of particles (aerosols) in the atmosphere. This portioning between the air and the surfaces of solids that are present in the air is poorly understood however, one phase may be preferred over the other due to incomplete mixing, physical barriers, and/or chemical reactions on the aerosol particles. Laboratory studies are conducted on single aerosol particles to isolate and investigate how and why compounds stick to their surfaces. These experimental studies provide fundamental parameters for improving computer models on aerosol formation and changes in these particles with time (ageing). This research is important as it may ultimately improve regional and global models of aerosols, which are relevant to air quality and human and animal health. Professor Keutsch also designs laboratory experiments to introduce a systems approach to undergraduate education.  This approach considers not only individual reactions but the coupled chemical and physical feedbacks that exist between different parts of the whole system (in this case, the gas and solid phases). His students learn about instrumentation design and reactions at and far from equilibrium. In addition, underrepresented high school students at Cambridge, MA high schools are mentored and work in the research laboratory learning to communicate their research to others in the field and gaining confidence in their abilities to participate in scientific fields. <br/><br/>A new approach is used to study aerosol partitioning that combines levitation of individual micron-sized particles with mass-spectrometric (MS) detection. This technique allows the measurement of the molecular-level evolution of a droplet over atmospherically relevant time scales. Molecular-level detection is a novel approach that may advances trapped droplet methods. After further optimization of the trapped-droplet MS, specific research questions related to the role of non-ideal mixing, oligomer formation, transition metal complex photochemistry, and aerosol physical properties in gas-particle partitioning are addressed. This research is done in collaboration with chemists and atmospheric sciences.

For quite a while, the highest temperature, at which superconductivity was observed, remained at 23 K (or -250 C); however, in 1986, high-temperature superconductors were discovered with superconductivity surviving up to 138 K (or -135 C) and, more recently, even up to 203 K (-70 C) under high pressure.  Presently, the most promising candidates for room-temperature superconductivity are the so-called 'flat-band materials' (i.e., the materials in which the energy of electrons does not depend on their momentum in some range of momenta).  The PI and his team have recently discovered such behavior in silicon-germanium quantum wells and are pursuing the investigation of this material.  The proposed activities offer unique opportunities to train students in novel technologies at the cutting edge of present-day capabilities.  Northeastern University is famous for it's signature cooperative learning ('co-op') education, which affords students the opportunity for hands-on experiential learning during their studies.

The team intends to study silicon-germanium quantum wells of unprecedented quality developed by the PI?s group, as well as ZnO-based heterostructures of comparable quality.  In the past, the band flattening in silicon-germanium quantum wells was observed by transport methods by the PI's team.  However, the thermodynamic characteristics, like the spectrum of electrons, can only be reliably obtained by thermodynamic measurements.  The PI and his team intend to use the techniques already available in the PI?s laboratory at Northeastern University to measure the thermodynamic magnetization and the thermopower of the electrons in two-dimensional systems.  The first method yields the energy-averaged effective mass of the electrons; the second method yields the effective mass on the Fermi level.  The saturation of the energy-averages mass and the divergence of the mass at the Fermi level in the limit of very low electron densities is the hallmark of the flattening of the electron band.

These futuristic ideas are currently science fiction, but if we have any hope of creating these amazing technologies, we need to begin today. This collaborative project seeks to explore the fundamental underpinnings of the materials needed for such applications. Specifically, in order to design any of these futuristic devices, we need to have materials that are self-powered and assembled hierarchically from energy-using building blocks. Luckily, many biological systems, such as cells, plants, and humans, are already capable of sensing their environment and responding by moving, changing shape, or releasing chemicals. The basic building blocks of these biological ?systems? are enzymes, nanoscale machines made of protein that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In order to dissect and begin to create an understanding of how enzymes can animate matter, our team will use enzymes to power new synthetic materials at the nanoscale to microscale. In the future, these nanoscale materials can be assembled themselves to create new larger scale active materials. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The scientific objective of this project is to understand the physics of synthetic active materials powered by enzymes. The research team combines expertise in DNA nanotechnology, enzyme kinetics, single-particle tracking, and sensitive force measurements to address the following objectives: (1) The team uses DNA origami to design, create, and characterize a suite of active particles, driven by enzyme catalysis, with programmable size, shape, flexibility, and location of propulsive enzymes. This objective addresses a need to create new nano- to mesoscale active particles and uses these particles to understand the mechanisms governing enhanced motility. (2) The team characterizes the properties of an active bath of enzyme-driven particles via the fluctuation spectrum, dissipation of energy, and the ability of an active bath to propel passive particles to extract work from noise. A combined study of the single-particle motility and the active fluctuations that emerge from collections of active particles will reveal a wealth of new information, including the mechanisms of enhanced transport of active particles, as well as a non-equilibrium statistical mechanical description of active fluctuations. The importance of this approach lies in the potential to specify the microscopic details of active particles, like their size, shape, and flexibility, and then to discover how these attributes alter the single-particle and collective behaviors.<br/><br/>This DMR grant supports research to understand the physics of synthetic active materials powered by enzymes with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and Biomaterials (BMAT) Programs in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports theoretical research and education on fundamental questions of cell biology with implications for biomaterials and statistical physics. A remarkable feature of all living cells is that they contain many subcellular parts called organelles that perform different functions. Organelles come in different sizes and shapes and these physical attributes are often intimately related to their function. For example, mitochondria are compartments filled with lipid membranes folded upon themselves many times over. The large membrane supports protein machines that are imbedded in the membrane and whose function is to make cellular fuel molecules.  Similarly, cells build long polymer cables of length precisely matched to the size of the cell, and are used to transport materials from one side of the cell to the other. These observations motivate the question: How do cells assemble such three-dimensional structures? While genes encoded in the cell's DNA carry the information needed to make the molecular building blocks, how they self-assemble into intricate and functional three-dimensional structures remains largely unknown.  <br/>The PI will consider these fundamental questions using mathematical models for assembly of subcellular structures. These models will be tested against experimental data obtained by several collaborating biology labs. The goal will be to identify common design principles for assembly that lead to sub-cellular structures of a well-defined size and shape. New experiments in cells will be stimulated leading to potentially useful insights for making synthetic materials which self-assemble into specific shapes and sizes. <br/>The interdisciplinary nature of the research will provide opportunities for physics students to engage in cutting edge biological research. It will provide them with skills necessary to be effective members of an interdisciplinary research team consisting of biologists and physicists.

This award supports theoretical research and education on fundamental questions of cell biology with implications for biomaterials and statistical physics. Subcellular structures in cells have been observed for hundreds of years and yet it is only recently that we have developed the experimental tools to address key questions about them, such as: How do cellular organelles obtain their specific shapes? How do cells control their number and size? How does a cell 'decide' how many mitochondria should it have?  How does a cell construct structures with precisely arranged parts, such as sarcomeres in muscle with its regimented arrays of actin filaments interdigitated with myosin fibers?  <br/>The cytoskeleton provides a particularly fruitful arena in which to develop quantitative models that address these questions of morphology. Namely, over many years biologists have obtained a wealth of quantitative information about the structure and dynamics of the cytoskeleton. This work has produced a parts list of molecules that the cytoskeleton is made of, and how these molecules interact, while the question of how these interactions are coordinated in space and time inside the cell remains largely unanswered.  <br/>The PI will use theoretical physics and mathematics to develop a common language for describing the various size control mechanisms of cytoskeleton structures. An assembly of sub-cellular structures will be investigated as a stochastic process that involves different molecular components and mathematically different feedback mechanisms that cells employ to control their size will be studied. <br/>The proposed research will advance the fields of statistical physics, cell biology, and biomaterials. One of the key features of the proposed theoretical research is a close collaboration with experimental labs that study assembly dynamics of actin structures in yeast, the assembly of cilia in mouse hair cells, and of nucleoli in developing embryos of the worm C.elegans. It will also help train theoretical physicists interested in working on fundamental problems in cell biology."

Yet, DNA research and polymer science are separate scientific disciplines with very limited crossover. The lack of deeper integration of the two fields stems in part from the incompatibility of DNA with the conditions and reagents by which synthetic polymers are made. If this barrier is overcome, DNA can be freely used to craft many DNA-polymer composite materials, which can potentially lead to better disease diagnostics, therapeutics, and biotechnology tools than currently possible today. In the proposed project, the PI?s team will develop a form of protected DNA compatible with polymer chemistry, which can be restored to its natural form once the polymer has been made. Using the protected DNA, several DNA-based polymers previously deemed difficult or impossible will be synthesized to validate the methodology. Finally, a DNA-peptide copolymer, to be enabled by the protected DNA for the first time, will be prepared and tested as a vaccine in human cells. The biomaterials developed here represents only the tip of an iceberg; the successful marriage between DNA and the vast knowledge base of polymer science should result in limitless possibilities. These research activities will intertwine with educational programs to provide a diverse range of laboratory training to graduate/undergraduate students (including undergraduates from institutions lacking research capabilities) and to promote learning, awareness, and interest in science-related careers among high school students and STEM teachers.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>DNA-based biomaterials are primarily achieved through solid-phase reactions or aqueous couplings using pre-synthesized oligonucleotides. Both methods pose limitations for certain types of constructs, such as highly branched architectures and amphiphilic structures. The goal of this proposal is to greatly expand the types of biomaterials accessible using oligonucleotide building blocks by removing the barriers between nucleic acid chemistry and polymerization. Towards this goal, the PI will design chemically masked DNA structures that can participate in polymerization reactions (e.g. free radical, coordination, etc) in the organic phase. The masked DNA can be restored to native phosphodiester DNA under mild conditions following polymerization. Thus, many difficult and/or unprecedented DNA-containing polymers with controlled architecture, composition, sequence, and end-group functionality are possible with this approach. Among the various DNA-based materials to be prepared, a peptide-DNA brush copolymer will be investigated in a biological setting as a self-delivering/adjuvanting peptide vaccine. By facilitating the marriage of nucleic acids with the vast range of polymerization reactions, a diversity of new structures with technologically useful properties will become possible. From the educational perspective, the cross-disciplinary nature of the project (design, synthesis, and materials/biological characterizations) is a great teaching tool for the students at all levels to be involved in the project. The PI will continue to create research opportunities for undergraduate students and high school students/teachers through active recruiting, internship programs, course development, and online presence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two key notions in differential geometry, besides ""length"" and ""angle,"" are: ""minimal surfaces,"" which generalize the concept of a straight line, and ""curvature,"" which measures how a surface is bent. The early development of differential geometry is partly attributable to physics. In the early 20th century, Einstein formulated a geometric theory of gravitation, general relativity, asserting that we live in a curved four-dimensional world (""spacetime"") where energy and mass are manifestations of the curvature of spacetime, and minimal surfaces are indicative of black hole boundaries. Nowadays, differential geometry and minimal surfaces are at the heart of several physical theories and active mathematical research directions. The principal investigator (PI) will study problems regarding minimal surfaces that are motivated by general relativity and by the van der Walls--Cahn--Hilliard theory of phase transitions for multicomponent alloy systems. This project will also support the proposer's efforts to promote student learning, inclusion, and training through summer schools, workshops, and conferences, as well as via expository articles and notes.<br/><br/>This project spans three related active research areas of minimal surface theory in differential geometry. First, the PI will investigate the construction of minimal surfaces as limiting min-max phase transitions. This construction has been recently shown to exhibit certain desirable stability properties that led to the proof of the ""multiplicity one min-max conjecture"" in three dimensions by the PI and Chodosh. The PI will continue this program, to produce surfaces with different curvatures and in different dimensions, as well as to better understand geometric implications of stable phase transitions. Second, as a step toward understanding limits of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, the PI will study smooth and non-smooth three- and four-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature via the inherent bending effects of their embedded minimal surfaces.

In one noteworthy example, quantum control of atoms was used to build atomic clocks that enable the Global Positioning System (GPS).  More recently, scientists discovered that atoms and molecules can be harnessed to build a quantum simulator, a resource for studying complex quantum phenomena.  This is important because quantum simulators may lead to advances in chemistry, medicine, computation, and several other scientific fields that contribute to the national health and economy.  However, a reliable way to build useful quantum simulators is not yet known. This project aims to pioneer methods to prepare and control individual molecules for use in a quantum simulator. If these basic steps are successful, then larger quantum simulators can be built using these principles.   This project will also train graduate students and undergraduate students to use molecular physics and quantum control techniques, and this will prepare them to participate in the high technology work force.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a source of trapped ultracold ground-state molecules with single particle manipulation and detection capability, which are crucial to future quantum applications. To develop tools to build such diatomic molecules atom-by-atom, many widely used Atomic Molecular and Optical (AMO) physics techniques need to be further updated and expanded in order to access a much broader array of atoms and molecules. This includes the ability to trap single atoms by fast alternating trapping and cooling beams to eliminate light shifts, Raman sideband cooling of single atoms outside the Lamb-Dicke regime, and coherent all-optical atom-to-molecule conversion without large spontaneous emission. Many new tools will be explored, including atomic species-dependent optical tweezers for transportation without motional excitation. Combining such exquisite control of individual atoms with a tightly focused spectroscopy laser beam will enable the first realization of single molecule spectroscopy in the gas phase.  Such a novel source of two atoms would also provide a new paradigm of collisional study in which the exact number of participating collision partners are prepared. Furthermore, one could use the rich manifold of internal states of molecules as synthetic dimensions, strong electric dipolar interactions, and flexible geometric arrangement of the molecules in order to study novel phases of matter such as many-body localization and a quantum dipolar spin liquid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wicht at Suffolk University and Dr. Daniel P. Dowling at UMass-Boston to research proteins involved in extracting sulfur from naturally occurring organic molecules. The cycling of sulfur-containing substances is important to understanding how living organisms (including humans) play a role in moving this specific element between earth's water, atmosphere, and land components. The interconversions of compounds containing carbon-sulfur bonds and sulfur-oxygen bonds are observed across a range of microorganisms, but the order in which the chemistry proceeds only recently was discovered. Therefore, these chemical transformations remain largely unexplored. This research entails a collaborative effort by Dr. Wicht and Dr. Dowling to perform fundamental biochemical analyses and obtain structural information for how these events take place. Research assistants at the undergraduate and graduate level gain experience with enzymology, biochemistry, and protein crystallography. Additionally, participants engage in outreach activities with middle school students and receive specific feedback on lifelong learning skills important to the production of a modern STEM workforce. Strong scientific mentorship provided by PI Wicht and co-PI Dowling contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. <br/> <br/>The recently reported bacterial sulfur assimilation pathway from naturally occurring dimethylsulfone to inorganic sulfite is the central focus of the work. There are three monooxygenases involved in the biochemical reactions: SfnG (for sulfone utilization), MsuC (for methanesulfinate utilization), and MsuD (for methanesulfonate ultilization). All three enzymes are reduced flavin dependent monooxygenases that require three substrates: an organosulfur molecule, O2, and FMNH2. The kinetic landscape of the novel biochemical pathway from dimethylsulfone to sulfite is unknown, therefore the immediate goal of the proposed research activities is the determination of the apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for each protein in the pathway using visible spectroscopy. The kinetic analyses of purified recombinant enzymes are coupled with substrate specificity data determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. For each monooxygenase, a maximum rate of enzyme turnover and the specificity constant for the preferred organosulfur substrate is defined. High-resolution X-ray crystallography is used to determine the molecular details of enzyme active site(s) and reaction chemistry. Together, the experimental results are used to formulate a proposed overall enzyme mechanism consistent with the cleavage of two C-S bonds and the formation of one S-O bond. Mapping the active site environment of these enzymes guides future mechanistic studies by identifying important amino acid residues involved in bond-making and bond-breaking to sulfur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the large scale behavior of the universe is determined by Einstein's theory of general relativity, while the small scale behavior is dictated by quantum mechanics.  A prominent goal of theoretical physics has been to find a mathematical description of the universe which unites these large and small scale descriptions.  This work has led to the discovery of string theory, and a vast array of beautiful and intricate mathematical structures and equations.  The equations of string theory are difficult and complicated, and are expected to connect radically different branches of mathematics and physics. Understanding these equations, and the structure they contain, is the primary goal of these education and research projects.  This research agenda aims to understand mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena in string theories ranging from particle formation and decay to the emergence of gravity in ""holographic"" string theories.  The education plans aim to provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in learning and research projects related to the research program.  Planned activities include sponsored research projects for undergraduates, a bi-annual weekend conference for graduate students, and a two week summer program, including a week long summer school and graduate students and advanced undergraduates vertically integrated with existing summer research programs.<br/><br/>These projects aim to investigate several problems in geometry which are inspired by string theory, and which involve techniques from differential equations, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. The first project involves studying two equations arising in mirror symmetry: the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, and the special Lagrangian equation.  The goal is to develop a theory that relates the study of these equations to structures in algebraic geometry, using an infinite dimensional version of classical geometric invariant theory.  These equations present exciting new mathematical challenges ranging from the analysis of fully nonlinear systems to understanding the algebraic structure encoded in certain singular geometric objects, in analogy with connections between multiplier ideals and singular, positively curved metric on holomorphic line bundles.  As a result, this project will involve developing new ideas in partial differential equations, as well as differential and algebraic geometry.   These ideas are to be tested in a variety of simplified models, which will lead to the resolution of several open problems in Kahler geometry.  Another line of work will study the phenomenon of emergent gravity in string theory, and in particular the AdS/CFT conjecture, and connection with combinatorial facets of AdS/CFT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many diseased cellular states (including cancer and autoimmunity) are associated with aberrant regulation of transcription of genes regulated by super-enhancers (SEs), large clusters of enhancers that regulate the transcription of genes important for cell type specific processes in both healthy and diseased (e.g., cancer) states.. Therefore, the proposed fundamental studies are of significance to the design of therapies for diseases that have a large toll on human health. The immediate potential impact of the studies concerns inhibitors of SEs that are currently being tested in clinical trials to treat cancer and other diseases. This effort also has an important training component.  Undergraduate research is an integral part of labs at MIT. Formal mechanisms such as the MIT Undergraduate Opportunities Program (UROP), the MIT Summer Research Program and Amgen Scholars Program for underrepresented minorities, will be used to recruit undergraduates to the PI's laboratories. One PI will also participate in ACCESS, a weekend at MIT for underrepresented minority students designed to make them aware of opportunities for graduate study. The impact of this research on science and technology will be disseminated to the broader scientific community through the production of a video learning module targeted at both the broad community of citizens and specifically the K-12 educational audience.  MIT has been at the epicenter of research at the convergence of the physical, life, and engineering sciences. The PIs will teach courses wherein this interdisciplinary work will be highlighted.<br/><br/>Super-enhancers are occupied by an unusually high density of interacting molecules, and are able to drive higher levels of transcription than typical enhancers. Several lines of evidence suggest that they form via cooperative processes, and SEs are far more vulnerable than typical enhancers to perturbation of components that are commonly associated with most enhancers. Recently, the PIs proposed that a phase separated multi-molecular assembly regulates the formation and function of SEs (Cell, 2017). They suggested that some puzzles associated with SE function are consistent with such a model. These results provide just a starting point to explore the role of phase separation in gene control in mammals. By bringing together sophisticated theoretical studies (rooted in statistical physics) and biological experiments, the PIs now aim to study their novel proposal with the goal of developing a conceptual framework for understanding gene regulation in mammals, and why SEs evolved to regulate key genes. The mechanistic insights thus gleaned will also apply to diverse processes in eukaryotic cells that are mediated by phase separated membraneless organelles. By bringing together approaches rooted in physics and biology, the PIs aim to address the following significant questions: 1] What are the fundamental physical and biological principles that determine how SEs form and function to regulate gene transcription in mammals? 2] Why have genes with the most prominent roles in cell identity evolved to be regulated by SEs? 3] Why do cancer cells have SE-regulated oncogenes, and why are these so vulnerable to drugs that inhibit certain transcriptional regulators? In order to take steps toward answering these questions, the PIs propose to study two major topics: 1] Understanding the nature of the phase transition and its implications for gene regulation. 2] Understanding how super-enhancers nucleate and form.<br/><br/>This RAISE project is being jointly funded by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, by the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate, and by the Office of Integrative Activities."

Fluorescence imaging is a powerful approach to resolving the physical basis of mRNA transport using direct reporters of mRNA location and copy number in live cells. However, resolving these mechanisms requires quantitative, physics-based approaches that model ribosome-mRNA associations, copy numbers, and recruitment to synaptic and cytoskeletal sites where local translation is needed. The present project integrates live-cell imaging with physics-based modeling and inference of stochastic molecular transport and copy number variations to characterize the molecular basis of neuronal synapse development that is core to brain development and function in living systems. Educational initiatives advanced by the PI include undergraduate and graduate curriculum enhancements including a discussion based seminar course on the physics of living systems that is taught jointly between the Departments of Biological Engineering, Physics, and Biology at MIT. The PI is additionally active in developing and maintaining free web servers that distribute worldwide physics-based inference procedures developed by his group. The PI participates in outreach to under-represented minorities through teaching in an annual workshop organized by the Department of Biology over the inter-activity period in January. Educational and research activities of the PI are translated to undergraduate students through MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, as well as through host visitations of international students from foreign countries.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to understand the translational dynamics of messenger RNAs that are regulated by active transport mechanisms in neuronal cells. Neurons consist of highly elongated axonal and dendritic processes that extend hundreds to thousands of cell bodies away from the nucleus, where transcription occurs. Consequently, neuronal plasticity in development and learning requires synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins to be synthesized locally within these extended processes that cannot be reached by passive mRNA transport mechanisms alone. To achieve this function, mRNAs are actively trafficked by molecular motors to synaptic sites to enable local protein production. In this project the PI will apply single-molecule live-cell imaging together with physics-based modeling of mRNA and ribosomal transport to understand the molecular basis of neuronal mRNA transport. The PI will develop stochastic modeling and inference procedures to infer the association dynamics of mRNAs and ribosomes, as well as their physical association with filamentous actin networks, microtubules, and synaptic proteins to identify cellular landmarks that regulate mRNA translation. Fluorescence fluctuation analysis is performed to infer copy numbers of mRNAs and ribosomes in ribonucleoprotein complexes, which are cross-validated using multiplexed super-resolution fluorescence imaging in fixed neuronal samples with exchangeable DNA probes. This work will help resolve the physical basis of mRNA recruitment and trafficking in the formation and turnover of synapses that are central to neuronal development and plasticity.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Cluster biosynthesis is essential for cell growth and division since proteins requiring iron sulfur clusters play central roles in DNA replication and repair as well as many other important cellular functions. Despite its unquestionable importance, scientists understand remarkably little about the molecular details of how these iron sulfur clusters are synthesized and ultimately transferred into the appropriate proteins/enzymes. Professor Perlstein's lab is using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches to shed light on how assembly of a cluster on a protein scaffold takes place as well as on the subsequent steps required to ultimately insert the cluster into a protein. The research provides an excellent training environment for students at the undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows, equipping them with the expertise required to become leaders in research at the chemistry-biology interface.  Furthermore, by developing the curriculum for an undergraduate biochemistry lecture and laboratory course and a K-12 STEM outreach program both intimately connected with the research plan, Professor Perlstein's work broadens interest in biochemistry and biotechnology research which forms a significant portion of the job opportunities in the Boston area. <br/><br/>The specific goal of this project is to uncover why the yeast cytosolic iron sulfur cluster scaffolding proteins require ATP hydrolysis for their activity.  Since the yeast enzyme and its homologs in the Mrp/Nbp35 family of cluster scaffolding ATPases form a distinct subfamily within the deviant Walker A family of P-loop NTPases, Dr. Perlstein and her group hypothesize that ATP hydrolysis is utilized to induce a conformational change within the scaffold that is used to coordinate assembly of a nascent cluster on the scaffold with the transfer of this cluster to a recipient. This nucleotide driven switch could impact cluster assembly and/or transfer functions of the scaffold via direct allosteric communication between the cluster scaffolding site and the ATPase site, via regulation of dynamic interactions with other cluster biogenesis proteins, or via a combination of these two mechanisms. By determining how ATPase mutants affect cluster scaffolding activities in vitro, identifying other factors that interact with the scaffold, and elucidating how kinetic mechanism of ATP hydrolysis is affected by scaffolded cluster or other cluster assembly factors, the researchers expect to uncover how nucleotide hydrolysis is exploited by this large family of ATP hydrolyzing iron sulfur cluster scaffolds to coordinate assembly of a nascent cluster within the scaffolding site with the subsequent trafficking steps required to mobilize the cluster from scaffold to target.  This research is integrated with an educational plan aimed at exposing K-12 students to research and career opportunities at the chemistry-biology interface via collaboration with Boston University's Learning Resource Network. Furthermore, Professor Perlstein leads the development of an Intensive Biochemistry course for undergraduate chemistry and biology majors tailored to the needs of students planning to pursue research careers."

A technique called Raman spectroscopy reveals information about molecular structure using the light scattered by molecules as they vibrate at their unique frequencies. Over 40 years ago, it was discovered that the Raman scattering signals could be increased dramatically (more than a million times) when molecules were stuck to (adsorbed on) a roughened metal surface. That discovery improved chemical detection and analysis, however the signal improvements are not always reproducible from one surface to another and the precise reason for the enhancement is still under vigorous debate. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Xi Ling of Boston University is investigating signal enhancements in Raman spectroscopy on the surfaces of well-defined, two-dimensional (2D) crystals (e.g., tin sulfide (SnS2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2)). The structure and properties of these crystals are better defined and understood than those of roughened metal surfaces and thus, Professor Ling and her students may uncover how and why Raman signal are enhanced on surfaces.  New technologies are expected to emerge from this research project, especially in the field of chemical analysis, where it may become routine to detect just a few or even a single molecule of a substance. The students engaged in this project are gaining advanced training in spectroscopy (light-matter interactions) and molecular and materials design, both of which are increasingly sought-after areas of expertise in the science and technology sector.  Professor Ling will develop and implement a laser spectroscopy experience for students by collaborating with Boston University's Learning Resource Network (LERNet) and its outreach programs. This outreach program encourages young women and high schools students to enter science and engineering fields. Dr. Lin will also enhance open source education resources for high school teachers and students by developing interactive video lesson modules. <br/><br/>The mechanisms of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) are not fully understood, especially the chemical mechanism (CM), which remains relatively mysterious compared to the electromagnetic (EM) mechanism. The scientific objectives of this project are to gain a deeper understanding of chemical mechanism and explore the potential of 2D crystals to overcoming the key problem of reproducibility of SERS in practical applications. Quantitative SERS data from well-defined samples (both 2D substrate and adsorbed analytes) serve to test the CM theory in the literature. The Ling group is employing multiple analytical approaches, such as wavelength-scanned Raman measurements, micro-absorption spectroscopy, as well as rigorous group theory analysis to understand the origin of the chemical enhancement in a quantitative manner. Furthermore, toward the development of revolutionary SERS-sensing techniques, 2D crystal/metal systems are being investigated to understand how the 2D crystals influence the plasmon frequency and electromagnetic field distribution of metal nanostructures and demonstrate the high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility of the system in micro-sensing. Collectively, these investigations are providing a deeper understanding of the controversial CM in SERS and guide an innovative design of a better SERS platform. The broader technical impacts of this work include new knowledge of CM in SERS and the seeding of development of new technique for chemical and bio-sensing.  The education plan improves the quality, retention, and diversity of STEM students in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach applies understanding of materials and materials-related phenomena across disciplinary boundaries into biologically inspired problems with potential implications for applications. The project contains three major aims to investigate:<br/><br/>1.)  How spatial obstacles change the distribution of genes that appear at a particular place on a chromosome populations of invading organisms. Of particular interest is gaining insight into how environmental inhomogeneities can shape not only the boundaries at front of a population of invading bacteria but also the genetic structure of the bacteria. This research has potential to contribute to understanding the evolution of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, as when opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade catheters connected to hospitalized patients.<br/>2.) How mechanical properties of very thin shells are affected by temperature. This builds on the observation that fluctuations that arise with increasing temperature lead to unusual mechanical properties that describe distortions of a sheet over long distances. The PI aims to understand what happens when the sheet is rolled in to a thin spherical shell. This research has potential to contribute to developing strategies for the delivery of drugs to affected areas of the body, as well as having implications for mechanical systems assembled on scales 1000 times or so smaller than the diameter of a human hair.<br/>3.)

The PI will tackle problems that challenge theory and lead to intriguing confrontations with experiments. The issues addressed include spatial population genetics near obstacles and constrictions, the soft condensed matter physics of thin thermalized shells and the theory of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that control the nonlinear dynamics of directed localization in sparse networks with spatial randomness. Nonequilibrium statistical dynamics and population genetics that incorporate genetic drift, mutations, migrations, and competition and cooperation have played a crucial role in the evolutionary history of many species, in particular on solid surfaces. Examples include the migrations of invasive species, or bacterial invasions of animal tissue. Using the tools of nonequilibrium statistical dynamics and population genetics the PI will examine how these phenomena affect genetic lineages in spatial media containing obstacles. Because biological organisms do not typically grow up in well-mixed test tubes or featureless Petri dishes, it is important to understand how they behave in the presence of environmental inhomogeneities. The PI's research on thermalized shells builds on the ""extreme mechanics"" of thin plates and shells, characterized by the highly nonlinear Foeppl - von Karman equations. The background curvature of thermally excited spherical shells presents new challenges relative to flat plates, which will be addressed by generalizing graphical summation and renormalization group methods that have proven useful for sheet polymers. Finally, the project will investigate directed localization and the associated nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly non-Hermitian matrices (involving both excitatory and inhibitory connections) that arise naturally in simple models of interacting ecosystems and in sparse neural networks. The PI's theoretical research will determine how the intricate fractal eigenvalue spectrum that controls the spontaneous activity and induced response changes with an increasing ratio of inhibitory to excitatory connections and with a variable bias for the transfer of information in a particular direction.    <br/>Strongly interdisciplinary by nature, the research could provide insights into controlling human pathogen invasions, the development of drug delivery strategies, and human and animal neural development. In addition, the project will contribute to the training of students and postodocs in modern theoretical methods with a wide area of applicability."

This unique property makes SMAs ideal for the fabrication of powerful yet lightweight actuators for a variety of applications. While SMAs have already been adopted in a number of commercial technologies - from image stabilizers in smart phones to tools for minimally invasive endovascular surgery - the relatively low operating temperatures of commercially available SMAs (typically between room temperature and 100 degrees C) make them unsuitable for many applications. New alloys are needed that operate at either much higher or much lower temperatures to prevent inadvertent actuation by ambient temperature fluctuations or to allow operation under adverse conditions. In this project, a framework for the rational design of novel SMAs will be developed. The framework will couple high-throughput computational and experimental techniques using a physical model that quantitatively relates material properties to physical parameters. This framework will be used to screen a range of alloys with the goal of identifying new families of SMAs with tailored shape memory properties in terms of operating temperature and functional stability. The computational strategy will start with a rapid screening for alloy endpoints that exhibit relevant characteristics of shape memory alloys. Physical models will then be trained to rapidly interpolate the thermomechanical properties of complex alloy compositions in the region spanning the endpoints. Materials systems of interest identified in the computational phase will then be investigated using state-of-the art experimental techniques. The methodology developed in this project and the ensuing fundamental understanding of the phase transformation responsible for the shape memory effect will provide a pathway to the targeted design of novel SMAs that may be used in a broad range of applications. The methodology is also easily transferred to the design and understanding of other classes of active materials that may be used in sensors or actuators. The computational methods that will be developed in this project fit very well within a graduate curriculum for computational materials science and will be incorporated in a graduate course on computational materials design. This project will also provide the context for a summer internship program for undergraduate students and for high-school students from local public schools that will provide a learning environment for students to experiment with materials, processing, modeling, and data science. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Shape memory alloys (SMAs) undergo large recoverable shape changes as a result of thermoelastic martensitic transformations. These alloys have actuation energy densities that are an order of magnitude higher than any other solid-state actuator and are therefore of interest for lightweight and robust actuation systems. Nitinol, the most commonly used SMA, has actuation temperatures slightly above ambient temperature. To fully realize the potential of SMAs, new alloys are needed that can operate at either much higher or lower temperatures. In this project, a framework for the rational design of novel SMAs will be developed. The framework will couple high-throughput computational and experimental techniques using a physical model that quantitatively relates material properties to structural parameters. This framework will be used to screen a range of alloys with a goal of identifying new families of SMAs with tailored shape memory properties in terms of transformation temperature, hysteresis and stability. The effort will initially focus on known cubic binary and ternary phases with Fe, Cu, or Ni as the main component, and will expand as necessary. The computational screening strategy will start with a rapid screening for alloy endpoints that exhibit relevant characteristics of thermoelastic martensitic transformations and stability. Promising structures will be investigated in more detail, focusing on the temperature dependence of their properties. Physical models will then be trained to rapidly interpolate thermomechanical properties of complex alloy compositions in the region spanning the endpoints. Materials systems of interest identified in the computational phase will be investigated experimentally using sputter-deposited composition spreads combined with combinatorial nanocalorimetry and resistivity measurement techniques. The methodology developed in this project and the ensuing fundamental understanding will provide a pathway to the targeted design of novel SMAs that serve a broad range of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is most often accomplished using carrier ""vehicles"" that are designed to locally release their payload at a desired time, rate, and location, often in response to a specific signal molecule. Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that is frequently used as this signal molecule because it is generated as a part of the immune response and in ischemic events like heart attacks and strokes. Boronic esters are chemical groups used to give materials sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide; this research investigates the effects of making changes to the molecular structure surrounding these boronic esters. The PI synthesizes new materials by modifying biologically derived polymers with a range of boronic esters, and then we measure whether and how those modifications lead to materials capable of carrying payload molecules and releasing them in response to oxidizing environments. This research aims to discover design parameters that might be used to make the next generation of drug delivery vehicles. Mount Holyoke College is the oldest women's college in the US, and serves a diverse student body. The students who engage in this research will learn modern laboratory techniques and scientific communication skills, and their experiences will prepare them for future endeavors in a wide variety of fields.<br/><br/>Technical summary:<br/><br/>The use of arylboronic esters to endow molecular sensors and delivery vehicles with sensitivity to hydrogen peroxides has become widespread in the past 15 years. The large majority of these contain pinacol (2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol) as the esterifying group. The identity of this diol influences the rate of degradation in response to hydrogen peroxide, and may additionally affect the interactions between boronic esters and biomolecules. This project will explore the effects replacing this group with more rigid or sterically hindered diols in the context of modified polysaccharide-based polymeric materials. These materials will be evaluated based on their solution-processability, hydrolytic stability, and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, esterifying diols will be modified with hydrophobicity-modulating groups or releasable bioactive molecules, and their ability to encapsulate and release molecular payloads will be evaluated. This research will result in improved understanding of the design parameters for boronic ester-containing molecules and materials.

This map will reveal the location of these clouds, and establish their distance, structure, temperature, and internal motions.  All of these measurements will be compared with theories to learn which of our ideas about star formation should be supported. By comparing younger clouds with older clouds, the investigators will learn how the clouds change as they form stars.   Since our sun formed in this way, this study will shed light on the origin of the sun and the earth.

There are usually between 4 and 7 groups each summer of various sizes. The summer culminates with presentations (at Williams and often at conferences), and most groups write up their work for submission to a research journal. There are weekly talks by faculty and students, both in mathematics and in related fields. Students are part of a vibrant scientific community; over 100 students do original research in mathematics and the sciences at Williams each summer, and there are a variety of academic and social activities bringing all the summer students and faculty together. Now in its fourth decade, participants are connected with alumni of the program who are able to provide excellent perspective, advice, and mentorship.<br/> <br/>The goal of this REU is to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in mathematics. Topics will be drawn from a variety of fields. Possible areas include algebraic geometry, Bayesian statistics, combinatorics, commutative algebra, computational geometry, CR structures, discrete geometry, dynamics and ergodic theory, graph theory, hyperbolic manifolds, knot theory, mathematical biology, mathematical physics, measure theory, minimal surfaces, number theory, probability, random matrix theory, representation theory, Riemannian geometry, symmetry groups, and tropical geometry. In the process, students learn lots of background material. They typically work in groups, meeting with advisors as needed, and are encouraged to present as well as publish their work, all valuable skills for graduate school as well as non-academic pursuits. A variety of mathematical activities and topics provides a rich intellectual environment; students live together and are constantly discussing their work, and attend weekly talks by the faculty so they learn the basics of all the different areas being investigated that summer.  Our nation needs a wider appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out.  We have increased the numbers of students from traditionally under-represented groups participating in the program over the last five years, as well as from community college backgrounds, and we are continuing to look for new and better ways to encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation college students, and other underrepresented groups.  Students, faculty and the broader mathematics community will benefit from the presentation and publication of original research. Students will develop a lifetime network of peers and mentors, and many of them will pursue graduate studies, partially because of their REU experience.

This conference, first held in 1994, will continue to serve students and faculty from a diverse list of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the Northeast. The goals of the conference are to motivate undergraduate students, in particular underrepresented groups and women, at all levels to attend and participate in a professional conference of the mathematical sciences; to provide students with an opportunity to learn about the community of mathematical scientists by interacting and networking with peers and faculty; and to provide a venue where undergraduates, share their scholarship, and practice communicating through preparing and presenting talks. This conference is distinctive because it explicitly aims to involve first-year and sophomore students as participants and because it is free to attendees. It is thus able to nourish the mathematical growth and collaborative experience of students and faculty at institutions that do not have the funds for conference expenses. The conferences will include two panels: one on how to make the most of one's college career and the other on career choices both in and out of academia. The atmosphere of the conference is exciting and encouraging and conference surveys have shown again and again that the experience of attending and/or presenting at the conference is key to retaining and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences. The problem-solving, reasoning, and communication skills developed at these conferences are transferable and will prepare students to solve larger societal issues. <br/><br/>These three one-day conferences will each bring together 300-350 students and faculty from the mathematical sciences. Students, under the mentorship of faculty members, will give most (approximately 80%) of the 15 minute presentations which are organized into three 1- hour session times each with multiple parallel sessions organized by subject. All conference participants will come together for an hour long keynote speech given by a well-known mathematical scientist followed by a working lunch and two informative lunchtime panels. The conference organizers have an assessment plan to modify the conference's evaluation tool and to centralize storage and access of conference data and an outreach plan to increase participation by members of underrepresented groups and to include first and second year students, as well as high school students and their teachers.  Through the preparation and presentation of talks, students learn to take complex mathematical ideas and present them in clear, understandable terms.

Being able to control the attachment of sugar molecules is important because it influences the reactivity of these compounds in different systems. Chains of sugar molecules are called oligosaccharides and are found on the surfaces of cells, are structural components of plants, and often control biological processes. Professor Bennett and his research group will determine which components of sugar molecules match best with a reagent to help form the desired connections. They will then test what they learn from these studies by making a known antibiotic compound. Determining how to make sugar molecules link together at specific locations will increase efficiency in oligosaccharide synthesis and decrease waste associated with separating mixtures of products. The results of this research impact all areas of activity that require carbohydrate synthesis, including agricultural, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. This project also involves outreach activities to high school chemistry students to introduce the chemistry of sugar molecules.<br/><br/>The Bennett lab is using sulfonyl chloride promoters to control the stereochemical outcome of glycosylation reactions of deoxysugars. These reactions are difficult to control due to the lack of a directing group so finding ways to achieve this selectivity is important. Three specific areas of investigation are being pursued: 1) monitoring the reactivity of different deoxy sugars and sulfonyl chlorides to create a database cataloging which promoter is best for which sugar, 2) determining the chemical interactions that control these transformations, and 3) demonstrating the utility of the method with the synthesis of saccharomicin B. Lessons learned from these studies may allow for the synthesis of challenging oligosaccharides without the need for wasteful separation procedures. This program will provide an excellent training environment for a diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, this group will continue work on an approximation to General Relativity known as ""effective one body"" (EOB) that simplifies the modeling of binary systems and other perturbative frameworks used to describe the black hole event horizon. These techniques complement those used when looking for full numerical solutions of the Einstein equations. They will continue to produce sonifications of gravitational wave signals, a tool which has proven to powerfully illustrate how gravitational waves encode source information.  Additionally, the PI will make online tools to explore black hole orbits, with accompanying videos illustrating the strong-field nature of orbits which produce interesting gravitational-wave signals.<br/><br/>The specific projects that will be pursued in this time frame will be a mix of studies using black hole perturbation theory, and studies in support of astronomy with the LIGO gravitational wave detectors.  The PI's group will use black hole perturbation theory in collaboration with colleagues at the Albert Einstein Institute to revise and extend the very successful EOB approach to compact binary dynamics.  Work in this program so far has done much to clarify how interactions with a black hole's event horizon affect the evolution of compact binaries.  Ongoing work is now probing orbits with substantial spin-orbit misalignment, laying the groundwork for using the EOB framework on a larger family of astrophysically relevant orbits.  The group will also use black hole perturbation theory as the foundation for understanding self forces, computing how a body deforms the spacetime in which it moves and how that deformation acts back upon the body's motion.  In the domain of gravitational wave astronomy, they have begun a systematic investigation into how black hole modes are excited in the final merger of two black holes.  This analysis will allow us to understand how the mixture of modes excited by black holes mergers depends upon the collision geometry and characteristics of the merging black holes.  The analysis will also make it possible to learn more about the characteristics of the merging black holes from the gravitational waves that we measure."

This first quantum revolution enabled the amazing technological developments of the 20th century, resulting e.g. in modern electronics and immense societal impact. Today the world is witnessing the early days of the second quantum revolution, where the convergent elements of quantum mechanics like quantum superposition or quantum entanglement will lead to widespread practical applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography or quantum sensing. One of the major obstacles in achieving this goal is lack of specialized workforce. The required qualifications comprise deep understanding of quantum mechanics, but also include practical knowledge of the convergent fields of microwave electronics, cryogenic and ultra-high vacuum technologies, quantum materials, advanced computer programming and algorithm optimization, with elements of device and system engineering. Existing educational programs usually specialize in only one or two of the above areas. This project helps fill the void in educating the future cadre for quantum revolution by putting together a transdisciplinary group of practitioners experienced in various aspects of quantum science with a group of select graduate students from across the US in the form of an annually recurring Summer School. The cultural and intellectual challenge comes from a need to equip students with practical knowledge of multiple fields relevant to quantum revolution, but also from the desire to foster their ability to learn and maintain the curiosity needed for future progress. The interactions of students with leaders in the field are based on a mixture of direct presentations, tutorials and talks, with interactive activities including round table discussions, student presentations, and courses in practical use of quantum technology. Interactions between speakers from various disciplines, from condensed matter physics through quantum chemistry and engineering, are expected to generate new ideas at the boundaries of fields.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>As the first quantum revolution of the 1920s led to the modern digital and telecommunications age of the present day, the current position of quantum science suggests that a second quantum revolution is at hand which is expected to have wide reaching implications not only for our fundamental understanding of the natural world but also for computing, energy, and global connectivity.  A critical component of this development is the education of the next generation of scientists in the principles, methods, and goals of this ""Quantum Leap"".  This is motivated by the observation that the rapidly growing quantum industry is facing an acute shortage of uniquely qualified workforce. New approaches to education in quantum science are particularly important given the breadth of disciplines brought together in this area- reaching across mathematics, chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering.  As part of initiating this educational effort, this project puts forth a summer school for graduate students as a direct tool to provide an in-depth immersion in the emerging field of convergent quantum science and technology.  The approach of this gathering is a summer school wherein students are exposed to education in science and technology beyond what they could be exposed to in traditional classroom settings or typical conferences/workshops.  Lecturers focus on pedagogical lectures on these topics rather than seminar style research presentations.  Afternoon sessions are aimed at interactive activities involving students and presenters.  Themed panels with speakers and organizers serving as panel members for both scientific and career related sessions are planned. The lecturers are encouraged to participate in several days rather than one or two days, to include the additional benefit of cross-disciplinary ""pollination"" of ideas between lecturers from different disciplines. The program combines aspects of classroom style education, research seminars, multitude of interactive forms and an active discussion forum.  The two week duration for the school encourages both formal and informal discussion between students and lecturers as well as among the students themselves."

A quantum computer takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems, such as interference and entanglement, to process information.

Many physical systems are being investigated as potential qubits, the processing elements of quantum computers.  This project focuses on exploring the viability of molecular nanomagnets as qubits.

Typically, microscopic (e.g. atomic-scale) systems have long coherence times but are difficult to control and address while macroscopic systems offer greater control but less coherence.  The project focuses on exploring the viability of molecular nanomagnets as qubits.  These systems occupy a middle ground in which they have qubit properties that can be tuned (through, e.g., chemical engineering) while maintaining the long coherence times of microscopic systems.  The molecules under investigation exhibit so-called atomic-clock transitions, which make them less susceptible to the decohering effects of dipole or hyperfine fields.  The researchers use pulsed electron-spin resonance to measure the decoherence times for these nanomagnets near atomic-clock transitions.  In addition, the researchers aim to perform quantum gates (such as CNOT) on supramolecular dimers with coupled states built from clock transitions of the magnets.  Such experiments may herald the development of a molecule-based, solid-state quantum processor that exploits atomic-clock transitions to limit decoherence.  In tandem with these goals, the research team is investigating related fundamental quantum properties of these magnets involving coupling the magnets to a microwave resonator.

The terahertz range is just above the lower-frequency microwave (or GHz) range that is used in common devices like cellphones. Magnetic resonance measurements (similar to those in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI) can reveal key information about molecular structure and bonding, but they have hardly ever been made at THz frequencies because of technological challenges with the sources of THz light. Professor Nelson overcomes these challenges using short THz pulses generated in a simple, tabletop-sized, experimental setup to make THz magnetic resonance measurements in about one minute. Measurements of molecular and biomolecular complexes with iron or similar elements are being conducted to understand molecular structures and how they change during chemical processes. The project has broader impacts in making facile and inexpensive THz measurement available to scientific communities in chemistry, biology, and materials science with applications spanning energy harvesting to chemical catalysis to biomedical measurement.  In addition to providing training in cutting-edge spectroscopy techniques for graduate students and post-doctoral scientists, the Nelson research group also runs a unique outreach program (the Lambda Project) in which high school students come to MIT for hands-on experiments to learn about modern optics and modern materials.<br/><br/>The project builds on recent demonstrations of THz electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in both the linear regime in which free-induction decays (FIDs) are measured and in the nonlinear regime in which 2-dimensional (2D) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is carried out. THz EPR spectra of high-spin transition metal complexes with zero-field splittings that arise from spin-orbit coupling are measured. The splittings are highly sensitive to the ligands and their configuration around the central transition metal ion. The EPR measurement can be preceded by an optical (""pump"") pulse that initiates photochemical changes, with associated changes in the spin states monitored on picosecond time scales. 2D THz EPR measurements, demonstrated on the collective spin states of magnetic materials, are being extended to multinuclear organometallic complexes in order to measure spin-spin interactions between the transition metal ions, revealing detailed information about the ground and excited-state electronic structures of the complexes. In addition to these measurements in which THz magnetic fields coherently drive electron spins, the combined THz electric and magnetic field components are being used to drive both electric and magnetic dipole moments of chiral molecules in experiments that seek new methods for enantiometric separation.  Further impacts in chemistry and biology may be realized if improved enantiomeric separation can be achieved."

Arguably, the biggest surprise is the detection of very heavy binary black holes with masses more than thirty times that of the Sun, well in excess of the known black hole binaries in our galaxy. A research group at Harvard University will carry out a theoretical investigation to help understand how these heavy binary black holes form.  The scientists expect to learn more about the lives and deaths of massive stars, which are important in the history of the Milky Way and other galaxies, since they produce many of the chemical elements and influence their surroundings by emitting ionizing radiation and outflows.  The lead researchers also plan to modernize STEM education through the development of a hands-on computer lab that will make direct use of the data and software that result from the project, and work to increase in participation of women and minorities in theoretical and computational astrophysics, through efforts that are supported by, and complementary to, the project. <br/> <br/>The two most popular ideas to explain the how heavy black holes are made are (i) the classic common envelope scenario and (ii) the dynamical formation scenario. Both are promising in some ways, but also face serious challenges and open questions.  This research project will investigate a third possibility called the chemically homogeneous scenario, in which the stars in the system are very close at birth. Such stars are tidally deformed and believed to be prone to instabilities that cause chemical mixing. This supplies the nuclear burning regions with extra fuel and leads to very compact massive helium stars, which eventually collapse into black holes.  The principal investigator and a graduate student will conduct an extensive theoretical investigation of this channel. The primary aim is to provide predictions that can be used to constrain the scenario by comparison with observations of the properties of local populations of massive near-contact binaries (periods, mass ratios, and surface abundances).  The secondary aim is to compare with existing and future gravitational wave observations (merger rates, distributions of masses and mass ratios, effective spins, eccentricities, and orbital variations). The team hopes that these efforts will lead to the first solid constraints or upper limits on how much this channel contributes to the massive black hole population and on the physics that drives this channel.

Marshall of Amherst College use high speed, state-of-the-art methods to measure the microwave radiation given off by complexes formed between two individual molecules rotating together in space.  The patterns of the specific frequencies emitted is analyzed to determine the detailed shape of the complex.  The research gives fundamental information into how the two molecules are arranged with respect to each other along with precise distances and angles. This information, in turn, indicates the nature of the forces that molecules exert upon each other.  Such forces have important consequences for many chemical and biological systems, but are difficult to separate from the larger effects of the much stronger chemical bonds.  This project seeks to provide a greater understanding of intermolecular interactions.  The research also use these interactions to differentiate between mirror image molecules that have identical physical properties but different biological effects.  The undergraduate students engaged in this research receive valuable hands-on experience with state-of-the art microwave spectrometers, sophisticated data analysis, and modern quantum chemistry program packages. Additionally, they learn how to formulate questions and design the research methods. <br/><br/>This project uses both cavity-enhanced and chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy to obtain the rotational spectrum of gas-phase bimolecular heterodimers.  A macroscopic, coherent polarization is induced in the free-jet, gaseous sample via a pulse of microwave radiation, which the rotating dimers re-emit at characteristic frequencies in a free-induction decay (FID).  The FID is digitized and Fourier transformed to reveal the frequency spectrum that is analyzed to provide molecular structures.  The investigation of protic acid-haloethylene complexes tests hypotheses regarding the interplay of electrostatic and dispersion interactions with steric requirements that result in novel and unexpected structures.  Through the characterization of non-covalently bonded heterodimers formed between a chiral analyte and a small tag molecule of known chirality, which converts enantiomers of the analyte into spectroscopically-distinguishable diastereomers, the project contributes to the development of a new, improved method of chiral analysis with applications across chemistry and particularly to the pharmaceutical industry.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project focuses on the continued development and operation of new instrumentation for a detector based on liquid argon and the invention and incorporation of new analytical techniques to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which furthers the development and impact of LArTPC technology applications, using the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. This experiment will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE is in the process of making a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with its superior LArTPC detector, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. <br/><br/>The PI's Group has broader impacts aspects that address development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved undergraduate education; and increased public scientific literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polynomial constraints on parameters are quite common both in mathematics (for example, Diophantine equations in number theory, such as the famous Fermat equation) and in broader applications ranging from physics, where algebraic varieties are used to describe various configuration spaces (and even the shape of the universe!), to engineering and algebraic statistics. The inherent rigidity of polynomials, especially compared to more flexible transformations allowed in topology and differential geometry, makes possible to apply a wide range of techniques coming from algebra (the study of rings and modules) and even number theory, for example reduction modulo prime numbers. One of the most basic problems in algebraic geometry is to learn how to classify and distinguish geometric properties of algebraic varieties. In addition to discrete parameters, mostly of topological nature, algebraic varieties also have continuous parameters called ""moduli"". For example, Riemann surfaces (such as a sphere or a torus) are classified topologically by the number of holes (the genus). It was known already to Riemann that they also have 3g-3 continuous complex parameters (g is the genus). Quite remarkably, these parameters can be interpreted as coordinates on the ""moduli space"": the master space that encodes all possible geometric structures of a given topological shape. The PI is an expert on moduli spaces of low-dimensional varieties (curves and surfaces). The project will focus on developing new techniques and approaches to their study. The first approach is based on convex geometry, which studies shapes defined by linear inequalities (such as polygons and polyhedra). An idea that goes back to Newton is to capture asymptotic behavior of a distinguished system of functions to construct a polyhedral approximation of a curved geometry. Another approach is linearization. Derived categories linearize geometries just like tangent lines approximate graphs of functions. The PI aims to understand derived categories of several moduli spaces. Finally, moduli spaces can be studied using number theory by reducing them modulo prime numbers. To this end, moduli spaces have to be equipped with extra data to parametrize complex and finite geometries simultaneously. In addition to advancing algebraic geometry, the proposed research program contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through recruiting, training, and supervising of graduate and undergraduate students and providing resources for their research, teaching, and professional development. In particular, the project includes three problems specifically tailored for REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) as well as several PhD thesis problems. The PI will also continue to develop graduate and undergraduate courses, including courses designed to introduce a broader public to mathematics and science.<br/><br/><br/>The PI will work on several fundamental problems in algebraic geometry with a focus on compact moduli spaces of local systems, curves and surfaces. The PI has previously developed applications of classical ""commutative"" tropicalization of subvarieties in algebraic tori to moduli spaces. Recently, classical tropical geometry was extended by the PI and his graduate student Vogiannou to a ""non-commutative"" setting and the PI proposes to use this generalization to construct a geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space of local systems on a punctured Riemann sphere. In collaboration with Castravet, the PI intends to verify a conjecture of Orlov and Kuznetsov on derived category of the moduli space of stable rational curves (and related spaces) and to apply this description to find its non-commutative deformations. The PI also intends to use the theory of windows as developed by Halpern-Leistner to solve some open problems about derived categories of toric and log Fano varieties. In collaboration with Freixas i Montplet, the PI proposes to systematically develop Arakelov geometry of the moduli space of curves and to apply it to questions in number theory. The PI proposes several new projects on moduli of surfaces in collaboration with Urzua, including constructions of moduli spaces of surfaces with QHD singularities (admitting smoothings with rational homology disc Milnor fiber) and families of antiflips of total spaces of deformations of cyclic quotient singularities in the direction of answering a question of Kollar. In addition there are three projects tailored for REUs: Seshadri constants on toric and elliptic ruled surfaces, and equations of log canonical  compactifications of complements of hyperplane arrangements."

Detection of the proteases linked to SARS-CoV-2 would provide an alternative path for testing for COVID-19. With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Drs. Sankaran Thayumanavan, Jeanne Hardy, and Trisha L. Andrew at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to develop ""smart"" sampling swabs whose color changes when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is present. The color change of the swab results when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 breaks down a colorless, protein-derived molecule into individual pieces, with one of those pieces having its chemical properties changed during the break-down process, so that it absorbs or produces light that can be seen by the human eye. The investigators design and make the protein-derived probe molecules and then incorporate them into the fibers of currently-used clinical swabs. Their chemical design allows the probe molecules to be selectively broken down by the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and to produce strong color in the smart swabs even when extremely low concentrations of the main protease are present. Creation of the necessary chemical reactions and their application to develop the protease-responsive smart swabs may lead to inexpensive testing methods that are practical for use by individuals at home. Due to the generality of the release of proteases in the lifecycle of viral infections, the new chemical reactions and resulting technologies are anticipated to be useful for visual detection of other viruses, which may be especially meaningful during future potential outbreaks. Educational, training, and outreach activities focus on graduate students working with Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew in a cross-cutting, team-oriented research environment to address the development of front-line measurement science approaches, with anticipated highlights shared with the public and K-12 students about their experiences and lessons learned about how research funding can be used to directly impact a major societal crisis.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop rapid, accurate, straightforward probe-based sensors that detect the inherent catalytic properties of viral protease enzymes, which produce a clear optical readout. Efforts are focused on creating new sensing chemistries that utilize specifically designed dye-based reporters and using them to develop inexpensive, disposable smart swabs to detect the presence of catalytically-active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (CoV2-MP). The general research approach Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew take is to first generate protease recognition elements by designing, producing, and validating peptides that provide the optimal specificity to the targeted viral protease. The resulting protease recognition elements are then linked to donor-acceptor chromophores to create ""pro-chromophoric"" probes that remain in a dark (uncolored, discolored, or quenched) state. Upon exposure to the main viral protease, the free reporter is liberated and produces a highly intense colorimetric or fluorescence signal, with the estimated limits of detection offering sensing of sub-picomolar concentrations of CoV2-MP. Sophisticated reporter formulations with integrated chemical amplification routes are predicted to provide access to these limits of detection. Importantly, the protease-based detection strategy and swab test platform are easily and generally transferable for detecting potential future viral pathogens based on their specific protease structures.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For most highly complex interacting systems, energy is the only such conserved quantity, but there are exceptions to this rule. In rare situations, even quite complex systems may have additional invariant quantities whose existence constrains the possible physical configurations of the system. These extra invariants generally arise when the system possesses some degree of symmetry. The resulting constraints---the so-called conservation laws---are responsible, for example, for the clock-like regularity of the motion of Newton's cradle, for the existence of perfectly straight stable ocean-shore waves, and for the simplicity of the shape of the planetary orbits. The goal of this project is to learn to employ such non-standard conservation laws as a tool to stabilize atom interferometers; quantum mechanical devices used in ultra-sensitive detectors of gravitational and other fields. In addition, the project may shed light on the manner by which complex systems, once disturbed, return to equilibrium, and the time-scale required for that relaxation. This work involves exciting certain highly stable modes, so-called ""atomic breathers"", of an atom interferometer, and then studying the relaxation of these modes as they encounter a potential barrier. The high degree of sensitivity of the interferometer provides an opportunity for much more careful scrutiny of non-equilibrium processes than has been possible previously. <br/> <br/>There are three major components of the proposal: a study of the relaxation dynamics of the breathers, including effects of symmetry-breaking; the development of an experimental protocol for the creation of highly-stable breathers; and an assessment of the stability of the breathers against dissociation and decay. The group of four principal investigators possess combine unique skill sets ideally suited for these tasks: it includes experimental techniques for manipulating bosonic solitons (breathers made of bosonic atoms), theoretical quantum, mean-field, and classical nonequilibrium dynamics, Inverse Scattering Transform and nonlinear perturbation theory, and applications of the Bethe ansatz. The tight coupling of theory and experiment is a crucial aspect of this project and will be essential for its success."

There are usually between 4 and 7 groups each summer of various sizes. The summer culminates with presentations (at Williams and often at conferences), and most groups write up their work for submission to a research journal. There are weekly talks by faculty and students, both in mathematics and in related fields. Students are part of a vibrant scientific community; over 100 students do original research in mathematics and the sciences at Williams each summer, and there are a variety of academic and social activities bringing all the summer students and faculty together.<br/><br/>The goal of this REU is to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in mathematics. Topics will be drawn from algebraic geometry, Bayesian statistics, combinatorics, commutative algebra, computational geometry, CR structures, discrete geometry, dynamics and ergodic theory, graph theory, hyperbolic manifolds, knot theory, mathematical biology, mathematical physics, measure theory, minimal surfaces, number theory, probability, random matrix theory, representation theory, Riemannian geometry, symmetry groups, and tropical geometry. In the process, students naturally learn lots of background and are encouraged to present as well as publish their work, all invaluable for graduate school. The variety of mathematical activities provides a rich intellectual environment.  Our nation needs a wider appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out.  We have increased the numbers of students from traditionally under-represented groups participating in the program over the last five years, and we are continuing to look for new and better ways to encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation college students, and other underrepresented groups.  Students, faculty and the broader mathematics community will benefit from the presentation and publication of original research. Students will develop a lifetime network of peers and mentors, and many of them will pursue graduate studies, partially because of their REU experience. Almost all students publish papers in research journals and many present their results at national and international research conferences."

Professor Niya Sa from University of Massachusetts Boston and colleagues Robyn Hannigan, Michelle Foster, Nolan Flynn (Wellesley College) and Sarah Soltau (Bridgewater State University) have acquired a high resolution, scanning electron microscope (HRes SEM) with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) capability. A SEM/EDS focuses a beam of electrons at a sample. The electrons interact with the surface to produce a visual image of the material and identify its chemical elements. These images reveal details of the material such as the size and shape of nanoparticles on the surface or surface roughness.  Such images help to understand the properties of the material. One application is investigating the use of silicon as a potentially better anode material for a lithium ion battery.  Another study is investigating titanium dioxide, a semiconductor, which is used in dye sensitized solar cells to improve their efficiency.  The instrument is in a shared use facility available to other institutions in the local region including Bridgewater State University, Wellesley College, Emmanuel College, Bard College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Bunker Hill Community College.  It enhances the training of graduate and undergraduate students in research course instruction. <br/><br/>The scanning electron microscope is a powerful analytical tool for identifying chemical composition qualitatively and semi-quantitatively of various species. It is being used in a number of important research areas.  Energy related projects include investigations of silicon as an anode material for Li ion batteries and titanium dioxide as a support material for dye sensitized solar cells. Multivalent ion battery research is being pursued to learn how magnesium can be deposited from non-aqueous electrolytes. Research is focusing on the biomineralization of carbonate-based structures (bivalve and crustacean shells) as temperature and acidification changes in the aqueous environment. Thin films composed of metal particles with at least one dimension on the nanometer scale possess novel physicochemical properties which are being investigated. Potential uses are in information storage, biosensing and chemical sensing, as well as in heterogeneous catalyst applications.

Nature has optimized the mechanism of photosynthesis to absorb and harvest solar energy by transforming carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate fuels. Yet, this apparently simple transformation of carbon dioxide and water - the most ubiquitous chemicals on earth - to a sustainable fuel source still represents one of the grand challenges of science today. In this project, Dr. Rochford of University of Massachusetts Boston learns from nature and develops a next generation of molecular catalysts that can mimic photosynthesis to efficiently transform carbon dioxide and water into useful fuels. Just as we are strongly influenced by our own environment in a macroscopic world, the behavior and properties of carbon dioxide and water are also very sensitive to their local environment at a molecular scale.  Dr. Rochford and his students utilize ""self-assembly"" techniques, inspired by photosynthesis, to leverage the environmental sensitivity of carbon dioxide and water to optimize their sustainable transformation into fuels. This grant from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Chemistry Division enriches the undergraduate and graduate experiences of many UMass Boston students and has a major positive impact on the UMass Boston research portfolio. <br/><br/>This project represents a novel approach to electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction through the design and synthesis of molecular catalysts with engineered second- and outer-coordination spheres providing selective control over product formation (carbon monoxide vs. formic acid vs. hydrogen gas). Significant intellectual merit is achieved by targeting first-row Mn(I)-based transition metal catalysts whereby tailoring the second- and outer-coordination sphere of the ligand, transition-state energies is optimized to promote proton-coupled electron transfer, thus reducing activation energies for critical rate-determining steps to maximize catalyst turnover frequencies, and reduce the minimum required overpotential. Dr. Rochford and his students develop cutting-edge catalyst design methods, from synthesis to self-assembly, combined with tailored electrochemical analyses, which impacts on a host of research areas that employ nanostructured and electroactive surfaces. Success in this area informs the chemical catalysis community to better design, control and optimize first-row transition metal catalysts for selective carbon dioxide conversion at accessible overpotentials. Dr. Rochford is a strong advocate of education for young scholars regarding the environmental impacts of carbon dioxide, renewable energy alternatives, and advances in renewable energy technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though ubiquitous, wave-type equations are far from well understood. The goal of this project is to understand how waves are affected by interference with themselves or with their environment. The research seeks to learn when and why some waves disperse, other waves persist, and still others collapse. Knowing how waves behave drives technological progress - smaller microchips, faster data transmission, and deeper insights into the formation of the universe. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The investigator will study nonlinear wave equations  that admit topological solitons, which are used to model the physical phenomena described above. Technically, these are coherent solitary waves with a nontrivial topological invariant. Canonical examples include kinks in scalar field theories, harmonic maps as stationary wave maps, vortices in gauged Ginzburg-Landau theory, magnetic monopoles, Skyrmions, and Yang-Mills instantons. The goal is to understand how topological solitons influence the dynamics, and to resolve two long-standing, open questions. First, the investigator will try to prove that nonlinear waves can be uniquely continued past a singularity that develops in finite time by concentrating energy (bubbling) in a soliton. Second, the investigator seeks to show that multi-soliton collisions are necessarily inelastic for non-integrable wave equations such as the phi-4 scalar field model and the wave maps equation. Crucial parts of this program are existence and uniqueness proofs of solutions exhibiting finite time bubbling and global-in-time multi-soliton dynamics.

Additionally, this material, when appropriately chemically modified, is well-suited to serve as a model system for studying the role of defects in influencing the performance of mixed ionic-electronic conducting electrodes in, for example, solid oxide fuel cells, noted for their high chemical-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies. Novel in situ high temperature measurements are being employed to explore defect formation and transport and the effects of microstructure on the electrical, electrochemical and optical properties of barium tin oxide, as well as exploring and optimizing its thin film growth. Insights gained will aid in developing more robust transparent and mixed conductive electrodes for solar and fuel cell applications and generally provide critical insights into how variations in growth parameters impact the chemistry and morphology of functional thin films and thereby their properties. A science, technology, engineering & mathematics (STEM) project-based course for high school students, drawn from both inner city and suburban schools, with a focus on minority and female students, is developed and implemented, in conjunction with a high school teacher/ teacher-training faculty member, on the topic of clean energy and environmental technologies, to improve their scientific understanding of pressing global issues and stimulate them to consider STEM careers. Research internships, are offered to undergraduate students from the science and engineering disciplines, to provide them with the opportunity to experience research in action.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The electrical, electrochemical and optical behavior of acceptor- and donor-doped barium tin oxide, a prime candidate for the much needed replacement of low-abundance transparent electrodes for solar cells, are being investigated over a wide range of temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Novel in situ characterization methods allow for development of quantitative defect and transport models for donor- and acceptor-doped materials, vital steps towards their practical utilization as a transparent or mixed ionic-electronic conducting materials. A novel method for monitoring film growth in situ will allow for the efficient optimization of film growth, microstructure and properties of these, and ultimately all physical vapor deposited films, with respect to deposition conditions. Additional focus is placed on quantifying and explaining the significant impact of grain boundaries on the effective electron mobility of transparent conductive barium tin oxide. This research approach provides an excellent opportunity for the designated graduate student to learn cutting edge experimental and modeling techniques and gain a broader appreciation of how materials research can address society's major challenges."
