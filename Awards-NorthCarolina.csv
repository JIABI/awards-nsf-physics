Despite the tremendous practical success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various data-intensive machine learning applications, there still remain many open problems to be addressed: (1) DNNs tend to suffer from overfitting when the available training data are scarce, which renders them less effective in the small data regime. (2) DNNs have shown to have the capability of perfectly ?memorizing? random training samples, making them less trustworthy when the training data are noisy and corrupted. (3) While symmetry is ubiquitous in machine learning (e.g., in image classification, the class label of an image remains the same if the image is spatially rescaled and translated,) generic DNN architectures typically destroy such symmetry in the representation, which leads to significant redundancy in the model to ?memorize? such information from the data. The goal of this project is to address these challenges in deep learning by exploiting the low-dimensional geometry and symmetry within the data and their network representations, aiming at developing new theories and methodologies for deep learning regularization that can lead to tangible advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence especially in the small/corrupted data regime. In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of this project is to leverage recent progress in mathematical methods from differential geometry and applied harmonic analysis to improve the stability, reliability, data-efficiency, and interpretability of deep learning. This will involve the development of both foundational theories and efficient algorithms to achieve the following three objectives: (1) The development of manifold-based DNN regularizations with significantly improved generalization performance by focusing on the topology and geometry of both the input data and their representations. This will unlock the potential of deep learning in the small data regime.  (2) Establishing and analyzing an innovative framework of imposing geometric constraint in deep learning that has immense potential of limiting the memorizing capacity of DNN. The mathematical analysis of the training dynamics of such model will shed light on the understanding of the fundamental difference between ?memorization? and generalization in deep learning. (3) The construction of deformation robust symmetry-preserving DNN architectures for various symmetry transformations on different data domains. By ""hardwiring"" the symmetry information into the deformation robust representations, the regularized DNN models will have improved performance and interpretability with reduced redundancy and model size. In terms of application, the project will demonstrate and deploy the proposed theories in real-world machine learning tasks, such as object recognition, localization, and segmentation. The techniques developed in this project will be widely applicable across different disciplines, providing fundamental building blocks for the next generation of mathematical tools for the computational modeling of Big Data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the area of signal processing, deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most successful computational models, with numerous applications including visual object recognition, object detection and localization. Despite the wide success of deep networks, the data representation computed by these models does not necessarily reflect the geometric information in the input data in an understandable way; a gap remains between the remarkable performance of deep models and the interpretability of such performance. In particular, deep networks trained from enormous amounts of data typically have no specific structures in the model parameters, which also leads to significant redundancy in the model. This project will investigate the mathematical foundation for imposing appropriate structures in deep networks, aiming at more analyzable and efficient network models with theoretically guaranteed performance. The results will have direct applications in various machine learning tasks, improving the accuracy, computational efficiency and interpretability of existing models. The theoretical analysis to be developed will deepen the mathematical understanding of deep networks, which is important for the next generation of computational tools for machine learning. Students engaged in the project will be trained in an interdisciplinary environment of mathematics and electrical engineering, developing skills in both analysis and software implementation, which benefits their future careers in academia or industry. The project will also train future mathematicians and electrical engineers through course development, especially courses on machine learning and image sciences with public online repositories. The project explores the new possibility of representation learning using deep networks, a tool with immense potential to address key challenges in today's Big Data analysis and artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop novel mathematical analysis of the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, as well as innovative designs of CNNs with appropriate structures based on the analysis. Specifically, the PIs will study: (1) the geometric structures in the channels of the convolutional layers, with which the CNN representations can collaboratively and explicitly encode geometric information in the data with improved interpretability and robustness; (2) the spatial structures of the convolutional filters, by which the filter regularity can be analytically imposed so that the CNN representations can be provably stable to input variations; and (3) efficient software implementation, which transfers the theoretical results into applications such as object detection and image segmentation in computer vision. The PIs will use tools from harmonic analysis and approximation theory to address the following open problems in the field: the removal of redundancy in trained CNN filters in a principled way while avoiding under-fitting, the more efficient learning of invariant representations with respect to geometrical transforms in the data, and the theoretical guarantees of the deep representations learned by an adaptive network that is trained from data. The new mathematical understanding will guide the design of deep networks to achieve better performance, in accuracy and computational speed, and better interpretability of the learned data representation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Empirical potentials---also known as force fields---play an essential role in simulating atomic-scale interactions between molecules.  They are used in the computational design of materials and pharmaceuticals.  However, current potentials have been designed to be fast or accurate, but rarely both.  This presents a critical bottleneck for the next phase of predictive chemical computer models.  In this project, Professors Roitberg and Isayev are leveraging state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to ""learn"" potentials from ultra-large datasets of molecular energies and chemical reactions. The project is creating a new force field, ANI, that is accurate and fast, while also applicable to a broad range of systems in chemistry.  This research has the potential to benefit materials design, renewable energy research, and drug design.  The project is first step toward the use of artificial intelligence techniques to create new materials and molecules beyond what the human imagination can do alone. The research team is engaged in outreach through workshops on molecular simulations, ""Talk science to me"" science for the general public, and the involvement of high school students from the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) in the research.<br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to develop a chemically-accurate, extensible, and universal neural network potential, ANI, for use in ""in silico"" organic chemistry experimentation. The range of possible applications for ANI is very broad, from conformational searches to chemical reactions and ligand binding. Through intelligent sampling of new regions of chemical space, the researchers are expanding use cases for ANI to include arbitrary systems containing H, C, N O, F, S, P, Cl and Br atoms. The new design strategy is based on the ANAKIN-ME method, used in implementing the earlier ANI-1 potential. To train ANI-1, a database of wB97x/6-31G* DFT energies for 22 million structural conformations from 60,000 distinct organic molecules was computed through exhaustive, stochastic sampling of conformational and chemical space. Through rigorous benchmarks for organic molecules, biomolecules, and peptides, ANI-1 predicted total and relative energies with RMS errors under 1 kcal/mol, when compared to DFT reference values.  The enhancements being made to ANAKIN-ME are aimed at improving computational efficiency, expanding the range of systems that can be simulated, and achieving < 1 kcal/mol RMS error in comparison to high quality CCSD(T)/CBS quantum chemical energies. These enhancements include reducing the required dataset size for a given set of atom types, to enable inclusion of additional elements and chemistries; expanding training datasets to include data on atomic charges and forces, in addition to energies, and data for charged molecules; and implementing ""query-by-committee"" active learning approaches to facilitate learning of addition, substitution, and elimination chemical reactions by ANI.  The ANI potential is being disseminated through user-friendly open access mechanisms. The implementation of the ANI potential takes advantage of graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration to run on GPU-enabled workstations and parallel supercomputers.  The ANI software library has a simple Python API and is being integrated with popular molecular modeling and simulation packages such as AMBER, OpenMM and Avogadro.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed methods are expected to bring a great impact to accelerate the discovery of new personalized treatment strategies. Therefore the proposed work is directly related with the White House Precision Medicine Initiative(https://www.whitehouse.gov/precision-medicine) as a research effort to revolutionize how to improve health and treat disease. The proposed methods are also general enough to be applied to a variety of data sources including clinical, biomarker, economic and financial data. If successful, the projects will greatly enhance the acquisition and analysis of large-scale data for the scientific and engineering communities.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposal is to develop cutting-edge semiparametric methods and machine learning tools to realize the promise of precision medicine. Specifically, the PI aims to: develop flexible and efficient methods for discovering optimal ITRs (Aim 1); develop a general class of optimal ITRs (Aim 2); develop optimal ITRs with high-dimensional data (Aim 3); and develop optimal ITRs under population heterogeneity (Aim 4). The proposed work contributes to both semiparametric inference and machine learning fields. Machine learning methods have rarely been studied for doubly robust estimation and optimal ITRs with high-dimensional data. The theoretical developments including driving nonasymptotic distribution, risk bounds, new empirical process technical tools are challenging. The methodologies to be developed in this project will be fundamentally important and generally applicable for studying semiparametric models in high-dimensional setting. Using semiparametric and machine learning methods for precision medicine is an emerging novel area. The integration of research and education is a key aspect of this project. New courses on statistical learning and semiparametric inference will be developed. These courses will broaden the areas of specialized training in a department that has a strong history of attracting under represented groups. The PI is expecting to stimulate interests from a diverse group of researchers in numerous fields. The PI will also reach out to the K-12 education levels by training high school teachers."

Sizes of hundreds of gigabytes, terabytes, and even petabytes are no longer uncommon. Appropriate handling and analysis of such data is vital training for the future generation of graduates. With this goal in mind, the proposed REU program aims to provide 10-week sophisticated training in ?Complex Data Analysis using Statistical and Machine Learning Tools? to eight (8) highly motivated nationally selected undergraduates from Mathematical Sciences during summers of 2020-2022. The faculty mentors bring a rich and diverse experience to this training program.  PI Gupta, Co-PI Gao, Senior Personnel Richter and Stufken are statisticians; Senior Personnel Mohanty is a Computer Science faculty specializing in machine learning tools; and Senior Personnel Sun is a statistical geneticist in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The training program will motivate the student participants, particularly those from under-represented minorities, to go on to graduate programs in mathematical sciences and become better trained professionals capable of handling societal data analytics needs.  As part of broader professional training, students will undertake trips to major research centers in North Carolina such as SAS, SAMSI (Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute), and the Joint School of Nano Science and Nano Engineering. We expect that the research completed as part of this training will be of very high quality and will lead to journal articles and conference presentations.<br/> <br/> <br/>Complexity in data can come in a variety of ways. High dimensionality of the data is one such complexity where the number of variables can be relatively large as compared to the data size. Data contamination is another type of complexity. Students will learn the art of simultaneous handling of dimensionality-reduction and outlier detection as part of one of the projects. Noise-added data (to create confidentiality in data before public release) is another type of complexity. It is becoming common for researchers to have access only to scrambled data, and not the real data. In one of the projects, we will talk about why and how data are scrambled and de-scrambled using randomized response models, retaining aggregate level properties and ensuring anonymity to respondents. The machine learning component of the REU program will focus on leveraging the capabilities of sophisticated tools such as Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning, and Deep Learning for identification of social media posts related to disease symptoms, and for prediction of temporal trends in disease propagation. Violation of model assumptions is another source of complexity that necessitates the use of nonparametric techniques such as the resampling methods. In many matched-pairs design situations, a mixture of complete and incomplete pairs of data are available. Rather than ignoring data from incomplete pairs, we will train students in methods designed for analyzing such data. In another project, students will be trained in the subdata selection techniques which are very helpful in dealing with data of enormous size. This project will address questions of the type (1) what size should the subdata have to ensure a reliable analysis; and (2) for a given size, how should the subdata be selected? The overarching goal in all of these projects will be to train students in recognizing various complexities in data and finding the right techniques to handle such data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tiniest jolt from an intruder, a big fish perhaps, sends the school into a momentary frenzy, where the little creatures explode in all directions, only to reform the swarm seconds later. Squint a little and the school of fish appears like one object, one continuous ""living"" material with a life and intelligence of its own; grander than the sum of its parts, smarter than the individual organisms. The dynamic properties of such ""living materials"" contrast sharply with the static characteristics of traditional materials. The former consists of ""active"" components such as bacteria, self-propelled nanorods, or molecular motors, that locally consume energy to move, exert forces or perform chemical reactions, and so, are inherently out of equilibrium, while the latter have fundamental building blocks that are ""passive"", such as molecules at equilibrium. The PI envisions designing a new and distinct class of materials by putting together active components to create active materials. In the same way that schools of fish respond to predators, swarms of bacteria swim towards nutrients, or skin heals itself when wounded, an artificial active material of self-propelled colloids or insect drones can respond to stimuli, restore coherence of the flock or ""self-heal"", adapt, store energy and information, assemble and disassemble at will. The PI aims to formulate a framework for understanding active matter based on statistical physics which focuses on systems composed of a large number of particles that will contribute to the foundations for developing design rules for making living materials with functionality beyond ordinary materials. <br/><br/>Applications with broad societal impact range from novel active materials that are responsive, adaptive and self-healing, to aquatic swarming robots, for example for ocean exploration, under-water maintenance, remediation of oil, detection and collection of plastics in the ocean, to novel drug delivery platforms. The research and education plans are tightly integrated to one another, and both are designed to incorporate diversity. The PI will collaborate with programs that promote and advise on diversity, as well as evaluate success, and will include minorities and underrepresented groups both in her group and through outreach. Undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive training in a highly interdisciplinary field that combines computational, and analytical skills and draws knowledge from materials, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and engineering. Broader outreach with the public will be achieved through three exciting avenues: (i) podcast interviews; (ii) online material and a blog for students and postdocs with children; (iii) soft matter video project and (iv) local community outreach at science fairs. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research integrated with education on active matter under conditions of intermediate Reynolds number flow. The complexity of emergent active-matter behavior has been demonstrated at many length-scales in both biological and artificial systems. Most studies so far have either developed minimal models without hydrodynamic interactions or focused on microscopic scales, where the Reynolds number approaches zero, Stokes flow. Both approaches are vibrant fields of research showing novel emergent behavior and providing insight for nonequilibrium theories of active matter. However, a whole region of parameter space. active matter of inertial particles at intermediate Reynolds numbers, remains largely unexplored. The intermediate regime covers at least three orders of magnitude in the Reynolds number and opens numerous possibilities for materials science, and describing millions of different organisms that one can study as model systems. The overarching goal of this project is to study active particles in fluids where viscous and inertial forces coexist with the aim to build a framework for describing mesoscale active matter suspensions. The two main thrusts that build upon each other towards that goal are to: (1) study and classify single model swimmers, at the point they transition from low to intermediate Reynolds numbers, and then for increasing Reynolds numbers; (2) examine the pairwise interactions for different model swimmers and establish an understanding of their collective behavior, emergent swarming and many-body interactions. In this way, the research will contribute to formulating a statistical mechanics based framework of active inertial suspensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main approach will be to use fast randomized matrix algorithms, as developed within the research area known as Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA).  Prior work has shown that these RandNLA algorithms come with strong theory and that they perform well for many practical data science and machine learning problems.  The foundation will develop novel uses of randomization to combine complementary algorithmic and statistical perspectives. The statistical viewpoint attributes randomness to an inherent and desirable property of the data, while the algorithmic viewpoint claims randomness as a computational resource to be exploited.  The coupling of these complementary approaches poses challenging mathematical problems to be investigated in the proposed work.<br/><br/>The proposed work will establish the foundations for fast prototyping in two directions: A Multi-Pronged Direction to bring RandNLA to the next level and explore what is technically feasible; and an overarching Synergy Direction that fuses the results for prototyping. The Multi-Pronged Direction includes the following topics: (i) Matrix perturbation theory, to bridge the gap between traditional worst-case bounds for asymptotically small perturbations on the one hand; and perturbations caused by stochastic noise, and missing or highly corrupted matrix entries on the other hand. (ii) Implicit versus explicit regularization, where randomness as a computational resource for speeding up algorithms additionally contributes to implicit statistical regularization, thereby improving statistical and numerical robustness. (iii) Krylov space methods for fast computation of good warm-starts and computation of surrogate models in the form of low-rank approximations, and specifically a better understanding of these methods in an algorithm-independent setting. (iv) Randomized basis construction methods that use matrix factorizations to compute low-rank approximations at low to moderate levels of accuracy. The Synergy Direction will explore topics like ultra-low accuracy matrix computations in machine learning applications, where merely a correct sign or exponent is sufficient. As a group, the PIs possess unrivaled and complementary expertise in applying fundamental mathematical tools to numerical applications in machine learning, data mining and scientific computing.  Importantly, the proposed methods will have significant impact in big data analysis, scientific computing, data mining and machine learning, where matrix computations are of paramount importance. The proposed work is fundamentally interdisciplinary and will enable fast, yet user-friendly extraction of insight from large-scale data these societally-important scientific domains.  Specifically, the proposed work will (i) create a numerically reliable and robust footing for fast prototyping; (ii) advance mathematics at the interface of computer science and statistics, one of the objectives being a synergy of numerical and statistical robustness; and (iii) advance the development of an interdisciplinary community with RandNLA as a pillar for the mathematics of data.

Generative models learn the distribution of a data set from finite samples and provide an efficient sampler of the approximated density, rather than relying on labels for supervision. These models are a powerful tool for analyzing large volume, high-dimensional data in an unsupervised way. While generative models are an active research topic in machine learning, many theoretical and computational questions for such models remain unclear. This collaborative research project will study generative models from a geometric perspective, focusing on both performance guarantees and efficient implementations. The ability to efficiently create new data points that are guaranteed to be similar to the existing data has important implications in a variety of applications, including medical data analysis and privacy, bioinformatics, modeling of image and audio signals, and general high-dimensional data analysis in which it is difficult to collect labeled data for supervised algorithms.<br/><br/>The ideas and approaches in this research project center around the techniques that have evolved in the manifold learning field over the past decade. These mathematical tools, in particular local neighborhood preserving maps, approximation analysis in terms of intrinsic dimensionality, and construction of global coordinate systems based upon local affinity, have natural applications in the study of generative models. The project is comprised of four fundamental questions that arise in the field: (a) What are the types of distributions that generative networks are capable of learning efficiently, and how does the intrinsic dimensionality of the distribution affect convergence? (b) How can non-parametric generative models be created for dimension-reduced representations that arise in manifold learning, and which only depend on the intrinsic geometry of the data? (c) How can efficiently-computed metrics be defined between high-dimensional distributions for use in assessing the validity of various generative models? (d) How can these metrics be used to examine the various paths generative models take through the parameter space while being trained, and what clusters of starting points give optimal generators?

The project develops and exploits underlying mathematical foundations, such as subspace modeling and invariant filter design. All the work has efficiency as its goal; this being manifested from the development of memory and computationally efficient forest hashing to the development of oriented response networks with significantly reduced deep models for orientation invariance. To enable state-of-the-art performance, the project utilizes successful machine learning frameworks, including deep convolution neural networks, random forests, hashing, and latent-SVM. This is approached with fundamental enabling redesigns and developments in the areas of robust learning, invariant learning, unsupervised self-learning, and multimodal hashing. The contributions are critical for data-limited learning, cross-modality learning, and computationally/memory efficient systems.

Singlet fission (SF) is the conversion of one photogenerated singlet exciton into two triplet excitons. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in SF thanks to its potential to significantly increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by harvesting two charge carriers from one photon. However, few materials are presently known to exhibit intermolecular SF with high efficiency, hindering the realization of solid-state SF-based solar cells. The chemical compound space of possible chromophores is infinitely vast and largely unexplored. To enable computational discovery of SF materials, a new multi-fidelity screening approach will be developed, which integrates quantum mechanical simulations at different levels of fidelity with machine learning (ML) and database mining. ML algorithms will be used to analyze data generated by quantum mechanical simulations and to steer simulations for further data acquisition. High-cost high-fidelity evaluations of excited state properties of solid-state forms of candidate chromophores will be performed with many-body perturbation theory methods within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Lower-cost lower-fidelity evaluations of ground state features will be performed with density functional theory. Feature selection algorithms will then determine which descriptors are most predictive of the thermodynamic driving force for SF. These descriptors will be used to screen databases that contain crystal structures with no information or only partial information on their electronic properties. Optimization algorithms will be employed to decide which data points to sample and at what level of fidelity to maximize information gain. This research will advance the discovery of new intermolecular SF chromophores and will lead to advances in data science in the area of experimental design.  <br/><br/>The award is jointly funded through the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving these problems helps to gain knowledge about the nature and structure of complex systems, and to better design and control these systems by making efficient use of scarce resources.  There are numerous parameters in the formulation of each such problem.  In many cases the exact values of some parameters are not available due to the lack of complete information, especially when such parameters describe future events.  An effective way to manage the long-term behaviors of complex systems under such data uncertainty is to introduce probability distributions on the parameters and use expectation functions in the problem formulations.  To numerically solve those problems with expectation functions, certain types of approximations are commonly used.  The investigators study properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined with expectation functions, relations between these problems and their approximations, and methods to solve them.  Of particular interest is application of these ideas to study the electricity market competition between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.  Results from this project can be used to evaluate the well-posedness of a given problem, measure the reliability of a solution obtained from a numerical procedure, and solve certain types of these problems.<br/><br/>The investigators analyze the structure and properties of optimization and equilibrium problems defined by expectation functions, develop inference procedures and sampling-based optimization methods, and study an application to the electricity market.  Their first goal is to develop an efficient inference method for the solution to the true optimization or equilibrium problem based on a solution to its sample average approximation (SAA) problem.  They expect this method to work for a general framework that allows the SAA functions to be nonsmooth, the SAA solution to be inexact, and the SAA asymptotic distribution to follow a piecewise normal structure as in the cases of general constrained optimization problems.  They apply this method to predict the out-of-sample performance of the SAA solutions.  Their second goal is to revisit existing importance sampling techniques to efficiently incorporate them into an iterative optimization algorithm for minimizing the probability of a rare event under some design parameters, and study properties of the probability function and compare solutions of the original problem with those of its convex substitutes.  The third goal of the investigators is to study a stochastic equilibrium model of the competition behavior between different types of energy generators in the electricity market and to provide a novel generalization of the classical Nash-Cournot equilibrium when the payoff functions are not concave.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when exposed to a stimulus, such as an environmental change in temperature, pH or light, some proteins undergo conformational (shape) changes that can lead to useful material properties, such as a phase transition, turning from a solid to liquid, or a liquid to solid. Understanding and predicting how these changes occur on the molecular level could lead to the creation of an entire class of soft materials that can respond to environmental cues. This research will develop and apply computer algorithms to quickly go through large amounts of protein sequence data to predict as yet undiscovered temperature-sensitive peptide sequences. These sequences can then be subjected to computer-based modeling to predict conformational changes that ensue from a phase transition. Finally, experiments will be conducted to predict and determine the 2D and 3D materials architectures that can be created by combining stimulus-responsive peptide sequences. If successful, these methods could create a toolkit for the efficient design and fabrication of a large variety of materials with custom-designed properties.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Stimulus responsiveness is a striking feature of proteins in Nature, whereby responses to chemical stimuli such as ligand binding, phosphorylation, and methylation, and physical stimuli such as changes in temperature, pH, light, and salt concentration lead to sharp conformational or phase transitions. Unlike proteins, which encode diverse responses to numerous stimuli by richly sampling amino acid sequence space, current bioinspired designs of repetitive polypeptides have focused on a tiny fraction of the vast conceivable expanse of sequence space. The primary goal of the proposed research is thus to develop generalized materials design rules, by combining experiments, fast and accurate physics-based computer simulations, and data science, to accelerate the discovery and development of a potentially huge class of thermally-responsive polypeptide materials by a systematic exploration of sequence space. This research will ""for the first time"" provide a complete atomistic understanding of the determinants of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) phase behavior, enable de novo molecular design of LCST and UCST peptide polymers and identify rules on how to combine them to create hierarchically-ordered, nanostructured polypeptide materials that exhibit unique morphologies that can be tuned as a function of their stimulus responsiveness. These materials could serve as nanostructured scaffolds and templates and enable a broad range of biocatalytic, bioelectronic, or assay devices. The PIs also plan to release the PIMMS modeling package, a set of tools for performing lattice-based simulations of polymers. PIMMS will provide support for the machine learning algorithms that enable the design of responsive protein-based polymers. The PIMMS codebase will be released as open source. A user community will be coalesced around the language by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute modules to or implement application-specific algorithms within the codebase. This is expected to allow a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award."

They find uses in engineering, economics, and machine learning, to name just a few areas. In the last few decades thousands of papers have been published on SDPs. However, SDPs are often pathological: they may not attain their optimal values, and/or their optimal value may differ from that of their dual. Such SDPs  often defeat even  the best SDP solvers, which fail or report an incorrect solution.  Can we understand these pathologies using something as simple as row operations inherited from Gaussian elimination? The project aims to answer this question affirmatively and lead to both theoretical and computational advances in semidefinite programming, and more broadly, in convex optimization. The PI will broadly disseminate the results, both in international and domestic conferences, and by training doctoral students. <br/> <br/>A linear system of equations can be pathological in the sense that it may not have a solution. We can understand this pathology by  transforming the system into a standard form that contains an impossible equation. The transformation is based on elementary row operations. The proposed project aims to use the same operations to transform SDPs into a canonical form, from which their pathology  (say positive duality gap) is easy to see. Thus, on the theoretical side  the project will show that elementary row operations - a staple tool in linear algebra - are useful to understand a much more general class of problems, SDPs, and even more broadly, convex optimization problems. On the computational side the project will develop a useful problem library to test SDP solvers, and other conic optimization solvers.

To address this gap, the PIs will develop new mathematical methods to enable the identification of interactions among genetic elements in cancer, thereby testing the hypothesis that many cancer phenotypes are regulated by co-occurring genetic events. Using the combined tools of modern topological and data analyses, including machine learning techniques, the research team will identify such co-occurrences by: analyzing generators of homology groups, implementing a computational data-driven theory of fiber bundles, and developing new models of cancer evolution using Khovanov-type categorification methods.

Researchers in this field develop materials and techniques for DNA-guided molecular and nano-scale self-assembly and have made remarkable recent progress, including the ordering of matter with unprecedented precision and parallelism, nano-scale organization of proteins and metal particles, as well as fascinating demonstrations of artificial molecular machines. One problem that has limited DNA nanotech's translation from prototype demonstrations to commercially viable applications has been the lack of a general purpose, rapidly-reprogrammable method for functionalizing DNA structures with polypeptides. The Cas9 protein from the CRISPR RNA-directed bacterial immune system is used here as a novel solution to this problem. Cas9 is a programmable protein that acts as an endonuclease for cleaving non-self nucleic acid targets. In an engineered form, dCas9 has been mutated to bind a DNA sequence (specified by an RNA molecule) without cleavage of the targeted DNA. The dCas9 protein, guide RNA, and its target DNA sequences are well understood, modular, and programmable. Consequently, dCas9 is perfect for use in the development of a new family of molecular assembly tools with designed sequence specificities and the ability to act as a new smart glue for the programmed assembly of other nanomaterials including protein enzymes, affinity peptides, inorganic nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes. The overarching goal of the project is to add the programmable recognition and binding functions of dCas9 to the growing toolbox of materials and methods available to DNA-based nanotech. Specifically, the project seeks to develop fusion proteins bearing mutant Cas9 domains to organize other polypeptides (including ligands, in vitro selected affinity peptides, enzymes, and inhibitors) on DNA nanostructures in programmed patterns for biomedical applications as well as in the bionanofabrication of electronic and photonic devices."

This includes scattering, reflection, refraction, absorption or excitation of chemical processes in, for example, retinal rods and cones of the human eye. The likelihood and strength of a particular light-matter interaction is governed by so-called selection rules. Many light-matter interaction processes are forbidden, or more precisely, highly-improbable, therefore limiting fundamental studies and applications of optical materials and processes. The ability to manipulate these improbable interactions is likely to enhance fundamental knowledge in many fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, photonics, chemistry, and nanotechnology. This research focuses on developing new nanostructured optical materials and structures, termed metamaterials, that help create specially shaped light beams. These custom-made light beams enable accessing those previously forbidden light-matter interactions. Beyond its fundamental science significance, this research could enable applications in spectroscopy and sensing devices, photovoltaic systems and quantum computing devices. This hands-on experience, along with exposure to state-of-the-art scientific problems and their investigations, helps thoroughly prepare participating students for future science and engineering careers. <br/><br/>Technical description: Spectroscopic transitions in atoms and molecules that are not allowed within the electric-dipole approximation, but occur due to higher-order terms in the interaction between matter and radiation, are called dipole-forbidden. Dipole-forbidden optical transitions in atoms form the basis of next-generation atomic clocks, and of high-fidelity qubits used in quantum information processors and quantum simulators. However, dipole-forbidden transitions are very weak and therefore exhibit narrow natural linewidths.  Recently, it was realized that orbital angular momentum, or vortex beams can make symmetry-forbidden transitions possible in atoms, molecules, and artificial atoms or nanocrystals. However, the transition rate depends on the beam size and increases when the vortex beam size decreases. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate and demonstrate the possibility of probing forbidden transitions in artificial atoms using orbital angular momentum carrying beams that have been demagnified to subwavelength scales using strongly anisotropic metamaterial structures. Interactions of orbital angular momentum beams with atoms enable hollow-beam traps, improve the spatial resolution of stimulated emission depletion microscopy and facilitate quantum information processing. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project gain hands-on experience in spectroscopy, nanofabrication and optical characterization of novel nanostructured materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed.

Such protein engineering is of growing importance to academic and pharmaceutical research due to the mild and green conditions under which the biological world operates. Therefore the goal of this work is to combine engineering and evolution to create enzyme scaffolds that assemble in cells and which can incorporate building blocks not typically found in nature. This research expands the chemical diversity and reaction landscape available to protein engineers and generates new tools with broad applications in biotechnology and biomedical imaging, as well as chemical synthesis. Dr. Brustad has developed a symposium for biotechnology research to foster communication and collaboration between local scientists and students. This symposium is now expanded to promote diversity by reaching out to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  Dr. Brustad is also developing a hands-on educational modules for K-12 populations in rural North Carolina, serving primarily young African American and Hispanic populations.<br/><br/>This research introduces a new paradigm for the construction of non-natural metallocofactor proteins in cells through the creation of orthogonal heme/enzyme pairs. An orthogonal heme:enzyme pair is composed of two key components: 1) a non-natural, synthetic cofactor that is similar to heme but does not interact with existing heme enzymes, and 2) an evolved heme-binding protein that recognizes only the non-natural cofactor. This ""orthogonality"" creates a new cofactor:enzyme system that can interact self-sufficiently in cells without disrupting endogenous cofactors or enzymes. A significant advantage of this approach is that it simply builds on (and adapts to) existing cofactor-binding motifs in nature to construct binding sites for metals and cofactor catalysts not typically found in nature. Scaffolds identified from this study provide robust and systematically adaptable artificial metalloproteins for green chemical synthesis as well as metal-based imaging applications.

These excitations, which include so-called Majorana fermions and non-abelian anyons, have properties that protect them against external perturbations. As a result of this robustness, control over such ""topological excitations"" would revolutionize electronics and bring quantum computing closer to reality. Over the past few years, the condensed matter research community achieved dramatic progress in the practical implementation of topological excitations. It was indeed realized that they could be artificially created by inducing superconductivity into certain types of low-dimensional materials such as semiconducting nanowires. The PI proposes an alternative approach to create the topological excitations based graphene subject to high magnetic fields and coupled to superconducting electrodes. The individual topological excitations are connected by gateable links, allowing one to controllably couple and manipulate them. The planar nature of the host material should facilitate making multiple copies of these devices, enabling future scaling and integration with conventional electronics. The project strongly emphasizes mentoring and education: it involves two PhD students, and undergraduate and a high school student. High school students from the NC School of Science and Math will be recruited to participate in the laboratory activities and get a feel for physics research. This research will train the graduate and undergraduate students in the measurement and nanofabrication methods relevant for both industrial and academic careers.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Working with Josephson junctions based on graphene contacted by type II superconductor, the principal investigator's group reported last year on the first observation of supercurrent through a two-dimensional region in the regime of the quantum Hall effect. This result proves the capability to coherently couple the superconductor electrodes to the quantum Hall edge states. It allows the principal investigator's group to approach superconductor-quantum Hall interfaces with more complex geometries, which are expected to host Majorana fermions. The specific goals are the superconducting electrodes in a shape of quasi-1D ""trenches"" etched in a quantum Hall mesa, with the edge states counter-propagating on the opposite sides of the contact. It has been predicted that in the spin-polarized quantum Hall regime (for example, at the filling factor equal to one), Majorana zero modes are formed at the ends of the trenches. Realizing these devices requires fundamental understanding of the coupling between the quantum Hall states and superconductor, as well as the development of fabrication techniques to design extremely clean interfaces between the superconducting contacts and the quantum Hall host material. Graphene has much to offer in that regard: a tunable band-structure and a remarkable electronic quality, which results in the appearance of the spin-polarized quantum Hall states at relatively low magnetic fields. Once formed, the Majoranas zero modes could be connected by gateable edge-state links, allowing one to controllably fuse (hybridize) them. Multiple copies of these excitations could be fabricated on the same mesa, enabling their braiding. The planar nature of the host material should facilitate making multiple copies of these devices, enabling future scaling and integration with conventional read-out electronics. Last but not least, the measurements are expected to reveal the fascinating physics of non-abelian anyons, which have properties distinctly different from any conventional quasiparticles. These topological excitations are relevant to a whole class of hybrid topological devices and could lead to breakthroughs that help make quantum computing a reality."

In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training. Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression. Deep learning predictive models can then be used for making predictions about the future COVID-19 dynamics, which can be compared to the predictions made by the original SEIR model. Depending on which mathematical model makes better predictions, another model can be updated with the better prediction as inputs, thereby representing reinforcement learning from both data and the best mathematical model. As a result, the new predictive framework will allow one to assess impacts of the immediate responses such as declaration of a national emergency, a school closing, or a quarantine, and can be considered as a step toward interpretable AI for COVID-19 biosurveillance.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With sufficient data and the appropriate statistical tools, researchers can now hope to recover structures in the data that were once deemed too intricate to identify with traditional ""small"" data.  Extracting complex hidden structures in massive data often requires flexible nonparametric methods; however, there are several fundamental challenges that make existing nonparametric methods impractical or inadequate.  At the core of these challenges is a conflict between two essential aspects in big data analysis: (i) the need for flexible methodology for capturing complex features and (ii) the cost, both computational and statistical, associated with this additional flexibility. Effective resolution of this fundamental conflict requires new paradigms of nonparametric inference. The long-term research objective of this project is to develop inference paradigms, including theory, methods, algorithms, and software, for nonparametric inference and learning that effectively resolve this fundamental conflict.  The research will lead to the development of statistical tools that meet urgent needs for scalable nonparametric data analysis in a wide range of fields, including biology, economics, astrophysics, chemistry, and information technology. The project will address the integration of research with educational activities through teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to students from local colleges.<br/><br/>This project will develop and investigate a particularly promising paradigm, multi-scale divide-and-conquer, to address the fundamental conflict between flexibility and cost.

Beyond addressing these specific objectives, the proposed research will introduce theoretical and computational devices for evaluating and improving the statistical and computational efficiency of multi-scale divide-and-conquer methods in general. The output of the research will include practical methods and algorithms for carrying out a variety of important nonparametric inference tasks on massive data, as well as general guiding principles for effective multi-scale statistical analysis.

Phase transitions are commonly found around us; for example, in the boiling of water, or in the reverse process of condensing water vapor into rain. In some semiconducting materials, a remarkably similar phase transition may occur. When exposed to the energy a continuous laser beam, electrons in the material get excited from their normal quantum state into another. However, the excited electron in its new state feels an effective attraction to the ""hole"" it left behind, i.e. the place where it used to be. If enough electrons get pumped into the excited state, they - and their hole counterparts - can undergo a gas-to-liquid-type phase transition. This phase transition, although its constituents are electrons and holes, has characteristics similar to the one found in water. However, a significant difference is that this happens on ultrafast time-scales (nanoseconds), and it involves a driving laser. Importantly, because the constituents are manifestly quantum objects, a host of exciting and interesting properties arise.<br/><br/>The materials in question form two-dimensional sheets, which means they may be incorporated into flexible electronics. On top of this, there is now the possibility of switching their behavior within nanoseconds from being a straightforward semiconductor (which are typically transparent materials) to being an object that is metallic and reflecting. This has promising applications for solar-light harvesting and for bypassing Moore's law through photonics. The project involves substantial development of algorithms and software, which will be disseminated to the community as open-source code.<br/><br/>In addition to the research, this CAREER award will support the improvement of STEM education in the U.S. by partnering with the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) to turn their successful ""Bootstrap for Computational Modeling in Physics First"" workshop into a distance-learning course.

The research team will study the transition into an electron-hole liquid (EHL) that occurs at room temperature upon high photoexcitation in transition-metal dichalcogenides. Due to the ultrafast nature of the phase transition, time-domain approaches are critical. This project will determine the conditions for creating and sustaining the EHL, its response to external stimuli and proximity-coupled emergent orders, its tunability, and its transport and transfer dynamics. This understanding will enable the use of the electron-hole liquid in novel devices, and, in particular, in applications for solar-light harvesting and for bypassing Moore's law through photonics.<br/><br/>The project exploits an opportunity for high-impact science through theoretical study and computational method development for nonequilibrium science. One essential aspect of the problem is that it must be tackled in the time domain, rather than resorting to the usual equilibrium analytic techniques. The PI will address this challenge through nonequilibrium many-body theory and through collaboration with the experimental community. The research team will consider the concept of a nonequilibrium phase transition without reliance on ergodicity by performing self-consistent calculations in the broken-symmetry states in the time domain. Through these approaches, the research team will re-evaluate how we think about nonequilibrium processes and phase transitions in quantum materials, and break the reliance on equilibrium concepts.

The need to model all aspects of the problem can restrict the scope of applications and, more generally, can be a burden to the data analyst who is often only interested in certain features of the unknowns.  This project will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework in which Bayesian learning can be carried out directly in terms of only the features of interest.  This reduces the modeling and computational burden on the data analyst and provides new insights about Bayesian learning more generally<br/><br/>A Bayesian approach is a powerful and rigorous framework for statistical learning.  The downside is that it requires a full model for the observables as well as all unknown quantities, the specification of which can be a burden on the data analyst. In addition to the familiar challenges of prior specification, there are also risks of misspecification biases. A more subtle complication is due to selection effects that result from considering several candidate models.  The data analyst's burden is further exaggerated in situations where only a feature of the unknowns is of interest, i.e., when there is an interest parameter and a (potentially high-dimensional) nuisance parameter and inference is required only for the former.  That is, the Bayesian approach still requires that the data analyst make non-trivial efforts to specify prior distributions and carry out posterior computations relevant only to the nuisance parameter, which can be viewed as a waste.  Yet having access to a posterior distribution for inference on the interest parameter is still a desirable feature, and the proposed research aims to develop a new framework for posterior inference directly on interest parameters.  These direct posteriors (DiPs) effectively target the interest parameter, giving data analysts an opportunity to avoid the seemingly wasteful modeling and computation efforts involving nuisance parameters.  This project will construct DiPs for finite- and infinite-dimensional interest parameters with rigorous theoretical guarantees, and will also develop efficient computational tools to facilitate DiP-based inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work is motivated by the potential for solar energy harvesting demonstrated by perovksites. The perovskite crystals targeted in this project have two-dimensional (2D) shapes where the faces of the crystals have millimeter-scale dimensions. Such 2D perovskites absorb light in the visible range and are relatively resistant to humidity, which is desirable for harnessing solar energy.  Professor Moran and his team plan to simultaneously monitor multiple places on the crystal surface to get statistical information on electron movement in the crystals. The information from these experiments can be used to guide material synthesis to make better solar energy conversion devices. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project become proficient in chemistry, computer programming, machining, electronics, and optics as the research group  is building most of their own equipment. In addition, Professor Moran and his students supervise laboratory exercises that illustrate the principles of optics and solar cells for middle and high-school students in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium on the UNC campus.<br/><br/>Professor Moran at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill is developing a diffractive optic-based transient absorption microscope capable of imaging electron diffusion in two-dimensional (2D) perovskite quantum wells. The quantum wells targeted have garnered attention for their stabilities under humid conditions and large exciton binding energies. In addition, the research team is investigating layered systems that consist of ""stacks"" of quantum wells in which the band gap decreases with respect to height in the film. Thus, electronic excitations are funneled from the bottom to the top of the film in these layered perovskites.  The diffractive optic-based microscope employed in this research acquires transient absorption data at 41 locations on the sample surface in a single experiment. Signals are simultaneously detected at two probe wavelengths using a pair of array detectors (e.g., wavelengths corresponding to energy donor and acceptor quantum wells). In studies of exfoliated crystals, diffusivities of excitons are being measured at a number of excitation wavelengths to establish a quantitative relationship between the carrier diffusivity and excitation energy. Statistical distributions of diffusion rates are generated by analyzing the dynamics at 41 different spots on the sample. The information derived from these experiments can be used to guide materials synthesis and device engineering.

The mechanical degradation of polymers limits their use in lightweight structural materials, consumer products, and biomedical applications.  Prof. Stephen Craig at Duke University is learning how to dictate the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions that are accelerated by an applied mechanical force. These reactions impact multiple aspects of materials design, including the macroscopic failure and mechanical limitations of current polymeric materials. In addition, mechanically responsive functional groups might serve as the critical elements in new stress-responsive and self-healing polymeric materials. Prof. Craig's studies aim to provide insight into how the macroscopic mechanical forces experienced by polymers during use can be effectively channeled into desired chemical responses, providing a foundation for new classes of polymers.  Broader impacts of the project include: (1) integration of research and education through a new, regional technical training program that supports and enriches the research activities and scientific training experiences provided by primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, advanced high schools, and smaller research universities; (2) active learning modules and associated laboratory experiences in introductory chemistry and through coupled undergraduate and high school research experiences; (3) broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by engaging and recruiting young scientists early in their scientific careers, before the onset of disproportionate attrition from the sciences; (4) disseminating the results of the research broadly; and, (5) addressing fundamental questions of molecular behavior in materials in a manner that will have an impact on a broad range of fields including polymer chemistry, physical organic chemistry, and self-healing and stress-responsive materials. <br/><br/>The overarching technical objective is to lay a quantitative foundation for mechanochemical kinetics by employing state-of-the-art physical measurements and developing new methods for quantitation. Specific experiments include the direct, experimental characterization and quantification of the effect of mechanical forces on covalent reactions triggered along overstretched polymer backbones. Because mechanical force, unlike conventional forms of energy input such as heat or light, is directional, the coupling between mechanical force and reactivity provides insights into the structure of transition states and the shapes of reaction potential energy surfaces. Despite its importance, however, quantitative measures of the effect of force on chemical reactions are rare. This project aims to develop two novel approaches to quantifying mechanochemical reactivity: pulling on single molecules of multi-mechanophore, non-scissile polymers with an atomic force microscope, and the pulsed sonication and molecular weight degradation of multi-mechanophore, scissile polymers. Models for the observed mechanochemical activity enable quantitative assessment of reactivity in both classes of mechanophores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in étale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

Examples include the spread of an infectious disease across people in a social network, the spread of a computer virus across machines in a network, and the spread of an invasive species across an ecological landscape.  The costs of these epidemics are enormous.  For example, 32% of global deaths are attributed to infectious diseases, the cost of computer viruses to U.S. businesses is estimated to exceed 60 billion dollars per year, and the cost of invasive species is estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars per year and to affect 100 million acres of land.  Thus, improvements to spatio-temporal decision making could have tremendous benefits to all sectors of society. Technological advances have made it increasingly easy to collect, store, and manipulate large amounts of data.  This research project takes first steps toward methods that use accumulating data on the spread of a replicating agent to inform resource allocation over time.  The methodology adjusts for non-stationary agent dynamics, changing availability of resources, and uncertain or incomplete measurements.<br/><br/>A key component of controlling the spread of a replicating agent over space and time is deciding where, when, and how to apply interventions.  This control process is formalized as an allocation strategy which comprises a sequence of functions, one per time point, that map up-to-date information on the spread of the agent to a distribution over subsets of locations to receive an intervention.  The project formally defines an optimal allocation strategy using potential outcomes, and demonstrates that spatial proximity induces causal interference among locations, thereby preventing direct application of existing methods for sequential treatment assignment.  A parametric estimator of the optimal strategy within a pre-specified class of allocation strategies using a systems dynamics model and simulation-optimization is developed.  This estimator has low variance and can be applied in a data-impoverished setting, however it may suffer from high bias if the systems dynamics model is misspecified.  A semi-parametric estimator of the optimal allocation strategy which does not require correct specification of a systems dynamics model is also developed.  Because the semi-parametric estimator relies on fewer assumptions about the underlying systems dynamics, it is potentially robust to model misspecification but may have high variance.  To balance bias and variance, and optimize finite sample performance, shrinkage of the semi-parametric estimator toward the parametric estimator will be investigated.  The methodologies will be illustrated with an application to the spread of white-nose syndrome in bats."

Both initiatives are investing heavily in generating high-resolution data, which once analyzed properly, can yield insights that will pave the foundations of advanced treatments for genetic and nervous system disorders. To fully maximize the potential impact of collecting such data, this proposal develops a new framework for identifying complicated underlying patterns in multiway arrays. Specifically, the project fills a gap in nonparametric estimation of low-dimensional structure and geometry in big and noisy data arrays. The PI plans to develop a training program based on applications of the proposed research to recruit and retain talented high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups for potential careers as innovative data scientists. <br/><br/>Modern data matrices present two challenges to their analyses: (1) they are transposable in the sense that both their rows and columns are often of interest and may contain non-trivial dependencies among them, and (2) they may be very large. The first challenge has only partially been addressed by existing biclustering or co-clustering methods. These methods can identify only very simple coupled structures that organize the rows and columns. In order to flexibly model and extract more complicated patterns in large data matrices, in which both rows and columns are high-dimensional, one requires a new co-manifold learning framework that can discover a wider range of intrinsic geometries of the rows and columns. To meet the first challenge, this project develops a framework for performing joint nonlinear dimension reduction on the rows and columns.  The proposed methods construct multiscale distances that are invariant to row and column permutations, equipping practitioners with a means to estimate the intrinsic organization of the rows and columns of a data matrix without prior information on any row or column orderings. To meet the second challenge, this project formulates the key computations as optimization problems that admit distributed parallel algorithms with nearly linear speed-up. The framework also generalizes naturally to the higher-order generalization of matrices, multiway arrays or tensors. Finally, the estimated intrinsic geometries possess stability guarantees, namely small perturbations in the data due to noise or adjustments to input parameters cannot lead to disproportionately large variations in the estimated intrinsic geometry. The proposed procedures have the potential to enable practitioners to extract complicated patterns stably from massive data tensors with non-trivial dependencies along their modes or axes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to advancing the fundamental science, this work is invaluable to all fields of science for which crystal growth is critical, such as polymers, pharmaceuticals, food products, geology, and atmospheric science.

Experimental measurement of the crystallization kinetics of oligoacenes and alkylammonium metal halide salts, as a function of the number of aromatic rings and length of alkyl chains, respectively, is being used to probe the impact of molecular anisotropy and crystal dimensionality on the rate of crystallization. Comparative kinetic measurements from isotropic vs. oriented melts of liquid crystals is utilized to articulate the impact of molecular pre-orientation on the rate of crystallization. Also, the crystallization kinetics across the family of substituted benzenes creates a geometric and energetic matrix with which to evaluate functional group effects.  The PI's recent discovery of Transition Zone Theory, the condensed matter analog of Eyring's transition state theory, enables for the identification of entropic and enthalpic activation parameters of crystallization reactions. This award facilitates a continuing offering of the summer teacher workshops, and also supports hiring a high school chemistry teacher to work with the PI during summers to write and publish components of this professional development, which affords greater dissemination of the problem-solving/discovery based materials."

To load these small lipid vesicles with therapeutic molecules, biomaterials composed of nucleic acids will be engineered. To ensure that the lipid vesicles will only target specific cells, the vesicles will be decorated with molecules that can detect diseased cells. This research is expected to have broad impact across several scientific disciplines including biomaterials, nucleic acid and drug delivery, nanotechnology, and cell-mimicking materials. The fundamental knowledge gained from the proposal will significantly change the way that membrane-impermeable compounds are delivered to cells, especially for large molecules. This has important implications for human health because these carriers should allow diseases that are currently undruggable to be treated more safely and efficiently. The project will also enhance the nation's education infrastructure by developing a new biomaterials curriculum for graduate students and by delivering interactive teaching modules to high schools.

These poresomes will be used to deliver macromolecules to the cytoplasm while bypassing endosomes. Despite tremendous progress in nanoscience, the cytoplasmic delivery of membrane-impermeable compounds such as negatively charged RNA remains challenging. This is because a significant fraction of the RNA that is delivered remains trapped in the endosomes, where it ultimately degrades. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to overcome these challenges by engineering cell-mimicking RNA-loaded lipid vesicles that are equipped with pores composed of connexin membrane channels. It is hypothesized that microRNA(miRNA)-loaded poresomes will connect to the connexin membrane channels of recipient cells to form gap junctions. In this way, miRNAs will be directly delivered into the cytoplasm whilst bypassing the degradative endosomal and lysosomal environments (Objective 1). Further, to effectively load poresomes with therapeutic cargo, the PI proposes to synthesize EXOmers, RNA-based sequences that are capable of exploiting the cellular trafficking machinery used to actively sort macromolecules into poresomes. Structure activity analyses will be performed to develop highly efficient sequences (Objective 2). Third, multifunctional poresomes that target non-internalizing receptors will be engineered to mediate cellular anchoring and facilitate miRNA transport through gap junctions (Objective 3). The educational goals are to (i) increase participation of underrepresented students through more understandable, relatable, and accessible science and (ii) improve biomaterials and nanoscience education for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.

When two clouds of these atoms collide, they bounce off of one another, creating shock waves. These experiments simulate properties of exotic matter in intellectual disciplines well outside atomic physics, including neutron stars and quark-gluon plasmas, which existed microseconds after the Big Bang. The experiments also test theories of super-high temperature superconductors, which operate far above room temperature, enabling energy-saving power lines and magnetically levitated trains. The project provides an ideal learning opportunity and serves to train undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates, who work as a team in a supportive environment with the PI to devise, construct, and perform new experiments, and to theoretically analyze the results. With this broad training, graduating students and post-doctoral associates are well situated to be leaders in tackling research questions that arise in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will study hydrodynamic transport and energy flow in a Fermi gas of 6Li atoms trapped in designer optical potentials.

Redirecting and repurposing enzymes to produce desirable novel chemical products is a challenge but could have significant industrial rewards. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Wei-chen Chang from North Carolina State University to repurpose specific iron-containing enzymes to speed-up a variety of chemical reactions that these proteins do not typically perform. Recent computational and mechanistic advances point to opportunities to use these enzymes to ""bio-synthesize"" compounds of industrial interest, and to understand the fundamental principles of how to control such reactions. Dr. Chang's studies use a ""substrate decoy"", in which the standard starting compound is replaced by a new reactant to change the type of chemistry catalyzed by the enzyme. For this project, the iron-containing enzymes are reprogramed to alter their functions.  Where they used to break down molecules, they now add chemical groups to create new compounds. The research plan is integrated with educational activities to inspire the next generation of students to pursue interdisciplinary research at the interface between chemistry and biology. The ""science express"" outreach activity uses a simple biochemical reaction that turns ordinary sugar into a blue dye (the ""blue genes for blue jeans"" hands-on experience) to show students how chemical biology impacts the world around them. These activities engage underrepresented K-12 students from diverse cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds in rural areas of North Carolina. <br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a substrate decoy approach to redirect the reactions catalyzed by mononuclear non-heme iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent (Fe/2OG) while maintaining their catalytic efficiencies. Dr. Chang's goal is to explore the potential of utilizing this approach to biosynthesize industrially important molecules. The research objective is to redirect the reaction outcome of these enzymes from hydroxylation to nitrile group installation. A complementary objective is to elucidate, through various chemical probing and kinetic approaches, the mechanism by which Fe/2OG hydroxylases catalyze this non-native reaction. Dr. Chang's educational objectives include developing an undergraduate course in enzyme kinetics that integrates chemical and biochemical concepts through active learning methods. In addition, his group has developed an easy-to-understand enzyme catalyzed reaction (""blue genes for blue jeans"") as part of  the science express outreach program. This program, established in collaboration with local teachers, introduces middle school students to exciting research in chemical biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, they are developing ""target-locked"" microscopy tools to follow the rapid motions of single proteins and other cellular matter within cells in real time. The information developed in this project will help us Understand the Rules of Life by helping us see what goes on inside biological cells both at high speed and with high resolution.  The Welsher group is also developing a set of experiments for the ""home spectroscopists"" aimed at using smartphones to illustrate the principles of spectroscopy and optics. These experiments illustrate the color components of various samples using simple red-green-blue values. Online videos ""Teachable Tidbits"" are being developed with an aim of demystifying chemistry concepts that are frequently obscured by mathematics. Finally, the research is guiding graduate students into the field of microscopy, with an emphasis on learning microscopy through relatively simple numerical simulations that the students build from scratch. <br/><br/>Internal molecular motions of single proteins have traditionally been investigated by single molecule Forster Resonant Energy Transfer (smFRET), which requires that the protein be tethered to a surface so that it remains in the focal volume of a microscope.  The Welsher group is developing target-locked smFRET to probe untethered single cytosolic proteins in real-time, thereby enabling studies of the effect of cellular crowding and non-equilibrium environments on fast protein domain motions which have eluded traditional smFRET.  The work should provide a more complete picture of the molecular underpinnings of cellular cargo transport by providing simultaneous measurement of ""tug-of-war"" motions of individual motor proteins and the local nanometer-scale cytoskeletal structure using target-locked super-resolution (TL-SR) microscopy. The high-speed, high-precision tracking and local sub-diffraction imaging of TL-SR may enable distinction between existing models of cargo trafficking.

The major goal of this project is to perform cutting-edge experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to explore both fundamental issues through precision tests of fundamental symmetries in the decay of particular subatomic particles, mesons.    The results from these experiments have the potential to shed light on critical questions such as:  the origin and dynamics of quark confinement, the nature of dark matter, and the mystery of the asymmetry of matter-antimatter in the universe. This project will also offer great opportunities to engage undergraduate students in research. It will create a research-enriched learning environment, explore new approaches to recruiting prospective students, and develop new courses which are research related.  Students will work in an international collaboration, which will enhance their international experience and allow them to gain gain global perspectives.<br/><br/>The major objectives of this project include: (1) publish the results from the PrimEx-II experiment (E-08-023), a precision measurement of the pi-zero lifetime; (2) prepare and perform the PrimEx-eta experiment to measure the eta radiative decay width (eta decay to two photons) (E-10-011); (3) develop an upgraded FCAL-II calorimeter for the newly approved JEF experiment (E12-12-002A) to study eta and eta-prime decays with emphasis on rare neutral modes in Hall D; and (4) continue the responsibility for maintaining and operating the low-granularity pair spectrometer detectors to control the photon beam in Hall D at JLab.  The symmetries of QCD are manifested in their most unambiguous form in the sector of light pseudoscalar mesons pi-zero, eta, and eta-prime. Precision measurements of their properties are crucial to understanding the QCD symmetry structure at low energy, as well as the origin and dynamics of QCD confinement.  In addition, the measurements of various rare and forbidden decays of the eta and eta-prime will provide sensitive probes for sub-GeV dark gauge bosons (a leptophobic vector B-prime and an electrophobic scalar meson) and C-violating, P-conserving new forces, which will extend our knowledge of the dark sector and explore new sources of CP violation needed to explain the matter and anti-matter asymmetry in the universe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of applications where this challenge is central is associating the shape of a tumor to molecular processes or associating the shape of the roots of a rice plant to crop yield.  In graphics and anatomy, there is the related question of how to warp one object into another, such as the molar of a child to a molar of an adult.  This project seeks to develop methodology to transform these shape data, such as meshes or 3-dimensional images, into representations for which standard statistical models are available. These methods are crucial to advancing data-enabled science in extracting, conceptualizing, interpreting, and visualizing information residing in datasets comprising complex objects such 3D shapes.  Cutting edge ideas in mathematics, specifically from the field of geometry, will be used to address the fundamental problems of (i) modeling structural variation in diverse collections of shapes and (ii) modeling transformations between shapes. Solutions to these problems are crucial to many practical applications and disciplines including biology, medicine, social sciences, and ecology. As such, an important component of the project is validation of methods and tools through applications in radiology and anthropology<br/><br/>Geometric concepts beyond Riemannian geometry and smooth manifolds will be leveraged to develop novel statistical methodology to address complex challenges in data analysis.  Methods and tools, grounded on solid mathematical foundations, will be developed for modeling complex objects (such as shapes and surfaces) and complex relations within data (such as multi-commodity flow or aligning shapes).  The research will address two statistical challenges using geometric tools: (1) representing surfaces and shapes via integral geometry, and (2) learning group actions or transformations between pairs of objects using the geometry of fiber bundles.  Addressing the first challenge results in a framework for parametric and non-parametric statistical models for collections of shapes and surfaces, without the requirement of landmark points and without requiring the shapes to be isomorphic. Addressing the second challenge provides a statistical framework for alignment problems ranging from aligning a collection of shapes such as teeth, to optimization problems on networks such as multi-commodity flow.  The solutions proposed will impact statistics and geometry, and the methods may catalyze transformative advances in practical applications and scientific disciplines as diverse as biology, medicine, social sciences, and ecology."

Total frictional losses in a typical diesel engine, for example, exceed 10% of the total fuel energy. Reducing the losses to 1% would save roughly a billion gallons of diesel fuel in the U.S. alone. Furthermore, today's lubricants were developed in an era that focused on wear elimination over energy losses from friction, and did not consider environmental consequences.

Scientists construct mathematical and computer models intended to capture the important features of a complex physical phenomenon, and learn more about the phenomenon by exploring what values of any uncertain model parameters lead to model predictions that mimic closely what is observed in nature.  Still, at best the models typically cannot capture all of nature's complexity ? or, as George Box famously put it, ""All models are wrong, but some are useful.""  This is really a good thing for discovery ? often scientists can get new insights and develop deeper understanding by studying precisely why their models fail to match reality.  In this research the PIs will develop a new approach to quantifying this ""discrepancy"" between mathematical models and observations, intended specifically for problems in which the data are numerical counts of events or objects.  Examples arise in nearly every scientific field ? counts of volcanoes or earthquakes or disease cases; of galaxies or stars or exoplanets; of photons or gamma ray burst pulses or neutrinos.  This project will specifically address two classes of problems in astronomy.  One class concerns how astronomers can convert raw data measuring light from astrophysical objects (such as stars and galaxies) into estimates of properties of the sources (such as brightness and color) with accurately quantified uncertainties, even when the precise shapes of the objects are not known, and their images overlap.  A second class concerns using astronomical survey catalogs to learn the dominant demographic properties of stars, galaxies, or minor planets (such as asteroids), such as the distribution of their luminosities or masses. The NSF-funded Vera Rubin Observatory will produce data for both types of problems. The research will include developing fast, open-source<br/>computational algorithms implementing the new approaches.<br/><br/>The project is motivated by application areas in which salient feature discovery is threatened by model misspecification.  In applications with real-valued magnitude data with additive Gaussian errors, statisticians have addressed misspecification by introducing additive discrepancy processes into models, often using Gaussian processes.  The two problem areas addressed here require analysis of discrete count or point process data: photon counting data comprising images and time series from cosmic sources, or demographic data in astronomical survey catalogs.  Both areas rely on Poisson point process models, with an intensity function describing, say, the photon arrival rate (per unit area) as a function of direction and time, or the density of galaxies as a function of spatial location and luminosity.  Additive discrepancy models are not applicable to such discrete-data settings.  The team will develop new semiparametric methods that supplement parametric salient feature models with nonparametric discrepancy processes that flexibly model the departure of salient models from the true data generating process.  An approach serving as a starting point represents the true underlying intensity function as the product of the salient feature model and a stochastic multiplicative discrepancy process.  The salient feature model will be a parametricintensity function (e.g., with location, amplitude, scale, and shape parameters), sometimes in a superposition of multiple components (e.g., stars in an image, pulses in a transient burst, or population components). To model discrepancy from the salient model, a natural choice with appealing theoretical properties is a multiplicative gamma discrepancy process; composition with the Poisson point process leads to an overall negative binomial point process for the observations.  The team will implement this approach, and generalize it in several directions. For demographic models, the discrepancy models will be embedded in a hierarchical model that accounts for measurement error and selection effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical effort will provide a platform, starting from a baseline model and simulation of exposure to inhaled COVID-19 without Ab protection. The baseline model will distinguish clearance of the inhaled viral load versus onset and propagation of respiratory infection. Two experimental interventions will be simulated on top of the baseline model at progressive stages of infection: inhaled doses of COVID-19-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and of structure-targeted mucolytics.  Both labs will leverage mathematical predictions to accelerate and optimize their strategies to mitigate COVID-19 disease. Likewise, experimental results and data will be leveraged to validate models and learn hidden factors critical to the predictive accuracy of the models.  The potential broader impact of this project is to predict optimal, mAb-based and mucolytic-based treatments for specific sub-populations at various stages of COVID-19 lung infection.<br/><br/>The mathematical modeling platform will explore the delicate interplay among: inhaled loads of COVID-19, their diffusion within, and potentially through, the mucus-coated respiratory tract; infectivity onset as COVID-19 reaches and invades epithelial cells, produces daughters that invade new cells and propagate the infection; how long after exposure to COVID-19 either natural antibodies or engineered mAb are introduced into the mucus layer; and, the rate of clearance of the mucus layer from the lung.  The latter clearance rate is known to depend, often dramatically, on structural properties of mucus in vulnerable sub-populations to COVID-19.  The experimental team will test outcomes of existing mAb on non-infectious COVID-19 nanoparticles. A multi-species stochastic model will simulate diffusion and propagation of COVID-19, interrupted by mAb-crosslinks between COVID-19 and mucins.

This line of research will shed light on what type of behavior one can expect to see in a typical system. From the statistical perspective, the project focuses on the ``inverse problem,"" in which one would like to learn or draw inferences from observations of a (possibly unknown) dynamical system. More specifically, the project involves analyzing the performance of statistical inference methods when applied to observations of a dynamical system or group action. Results in this direction will provide theoretical guidance on when statistical procedures may be successfully applied in the context of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials are made up of long, individual polymer molecules that are connected in a network that forms the bulk material.  In recent years, chemists have learned how to produce remarkable properties in the individual polymer molecules and control the connections between them.  The Center for the Chemistry of Molecularly Optimized Networks (MONET) is developing the knowledge and methods to translate the remarkable properties now available at the molecular level to new properties of polymer networks.  It fuels innovation in formulation and manufacturing, potentially leading to the development of tough, longer-lived materials that reduce waste while being perfectly tailored to their use.  The broader impacts of the Center include interdisciplinary technical training for young scientists across emerging areas of polymer chemistry, and communication and entrepreneurship experiences that position Center trainees for future careers. Finally, the Center partners with community colleges to increase public awareness of the societal impact of science innovation while simultaneously encouraging broader participation in the sciences by communicating the range of career opportunities available to the diverse community college population.<br/><br/>The scope of MONET comprises quantitative structure-activity relationships that relate polymer network toughness to the toughness of individual network strands, the molecular architecture of the network, and the mechanism and spatial organization of dynamic strand exchange reactions. These objectives are pursued through a unique combination of methods, including precision polymer synthesis, single molecule spectroscopy, coordination chemistry, photochemical switching, and the development and application of new theoretical models and methods. In addition, a prototype database and digital notation for polymer entry (GIGA - the Global Index of Gel Attributes) is being established. The combined gains in fundamental knowledge, technical capability, and informatics strategy address a major chemical knowledge gap. MONET addresses the role of precisely controlled polymer chain length, the molecular mechanical response of a polymer chain, and the mechanisms by which polymer strands exchange in dynamic networks, as well as the influence of molecular scale network defects on each. The knowledge gained informs strategies to bring remarkable properties to polymer networks, by treating them as complex but understandable chemical systems that can be harnessed to produce currently inaccessible collective properties. Key broader impacts of this award include the development of a polymer network database, technical training and professional development for developing scientists, and science communication to diverse audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The Standard Model predicted that there were three different kinds of neutrinos, all massless, that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they undergo whenever they interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another.   Additionally, experimental measurements have indicated the possibility of yet an additional type of sterile neutrino.   Detailed measurements of the interactions of these unusual particles are one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>This project is led by group members of the COHERENT collaboration that has been the first to observe Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering.   The reaction was predicted in the early 1970s and has now been observed nearly a half century later, given the advances in highly-sensitive, low-noise instrumentation and very high beam fluxes, for example at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source facility.  To understand the nature of this process, a range of nuclear targets must be studied, as the cross section for the scattering scales approximately with the square of the number of neutrons in the target nuclei.   Through this MRI award, the group from Duke, North Carolina State and North Carolina Central Universities will build and then operate a Germanium (Ge) detector for which the neutron dependence of the cross section can be verified.  Germanium is a natural choice for such a measurement given the excellent energy sensitivity afforded by this material.<br/><br/>In the broader context, the Ge instrumentation to be developed here has the potential for applications in nuclear reactor monitoring.   And the instrumentation development will provide extensive experience for post docs and students in the technically challenging research techniques of low-energy recoil measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

His research advances computational methodologies and simulates electron motion using of a large number of processors (or separate computers) to perform a set of coordinated computations in parallel (simultaneously) - this is called massively parallel computing. They are using this technique to study microscopic details of how electrons move in materials i.e., how materials carry electrical current.  This research may enable modern electronics to continue to decrease in size, while increasing in speed and complexity.  A new class of materials called topological materials represents a great opportunity to improve electronics if scientists can exploit their unique electrical conductivity properties. Current scientific understanding of how chemical features in topological insulators control the unique electron transport behavior is largely lacking. By developing novel computational methods, new simulations will enable a microscopic understanding of how electron transport properties are governed at the molecular scale.  The research activities will also promote science education at the undergraduate level for underrepresented minority students with interests in computational sciences,  Professor Kanai engages students through summer hands-on workshops where the students build a parallel computer and learn about both hardware and software development.  The student will be taught to perform electronic structure calculations and program simple code on the computers they build.<br/><br/>The large-scale, real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method is formulated in the maximally-localized Wannier function (MLWF) gauge. It is used to develop a fundamental understanding of quantized charge transport in extended systems at the molecular level. Topological Floquet theory is studied beyond the typical adiabatic evolution limit by simulating quantum-mechanical electron dynamics in real chemical systems. In particular, the quantized charge transport behavior is investigated and how chemical moieties can potentially be used to control the quantized transport is studied. The work further explores the novel concept of optically gated transistors that exhibits quantized conductance. Improving the real-time TDDFT code by incorporating advanced exchange-correlation approximations via time-dependent MLWFs is an important aspect of this investigation. Professor Kanai also provides hands-on tutorials on TDDFT methodologies at workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project's new approach, disordered carbon is converted into diamond or Q-carbon (a new phase of carbon that is harder than diamond) at ambient temperatures and pressures in air. This route to create diamond avoids the conventional extremely high temperatures and pressures needed in an inert atmosphere. Thus, this new approach provides a very inexpensive and rapid way to convert disordered carbon into useful (hard) diamond or Q-carbon structures for a variety of applications. This research involves a close collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) where their Advanced Atomic-resolution instrumentation is quite complementary to atomic scale characterization facilities at North Carolina (NC) State University. This project engages research collaboration and training of graduate and undergraduate students from a nearby Historically Black Colleges and Universities, NC A&T and Shaw. To disseminate nanomaterials research, NC State University has launched an MS (Master of Science) in Nanoengineering through Engineering Online network under the leadership of the principal investigator, where students around the globe complete their Master?s degrees. The students trained in this area are highly sought after for the employment in microelectronics, optoelectronics and biomedical industries. The principal investigator is continuing with a very successful ASM (American Society for Materials) Materials Summer Camp, where high-school students are trained for a week on new materials and technologies.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research develops a fundamental understanding of basic mechanisms involved in the direct conversion of disordered carbon into Q-carbon and/or diamond. The next step is to use this understanding to create novel Q-carbon and diamond nanostructures with unique properties for a variety of applications. By using nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation, carbon layers are melted in a super undercooled state at around 4000K (about 1000K below the melting point of carbon) and are quenched subsequently into a new phase of Q-carbon or diamond in the form of nanodiamonds, microdiamonds, nanoneedles, microneedles or large-area single-crystal films. These structures are doped with n- and p-type dopants, thus opening a new frontier in diamond nanoelectronics and high-power devices. Doping of nanodiamonds with nitrogen atoms (N) and vacancies (V) results in NV nanodiamonds which are grown epitaxially on sapphire substrates for atomic sensors and quantum computing applications. As a part of Nanoengineering program, the PI teaches a series of courses where students learn about the latest developments in new materials, thin film epitaxy, defect control, processing, characterization and modeling and next-generation multifunctional smart devices."

This effort begins with exploring superstructures designed to possess exceptional polarized spin transport properties, and their attachment chemistry to metallic electrodes.
