Oil and water don't mix. Examples of this common wisdom are prevalent in everyday life from the sheen formed on a rain puddle by spilled gasoline, to the separation of oil and vinegar in a bottle of salad dressing. These are large-scale examples of a physical principle known as hydrophobicity - a word derived from Ancient Greek that characterizes the ""horror for water"" experienced by particular molecules. This physical principle is also active at microscopic scales, with hydrophobicity playing an important role in controlling the structure and function of molecules in water. Of particular interest is the behavior of proteins: a class of molecules that use the hydrophobic effect to perform functions critical to life, serving as - among many other things - enzymes to help break down food, hormones to regulate physiology, and antibodies to protect against infection. Some physical forces can be described by simple and elegant equations, such as Newton's law of gravitation or Coulomb's law of electrostatics, but decades of work have shown that no such simple descriptions seem to exist for hydrophobicity. Instead, the hydrophobic interaction is a very complicated force that depends sensitively on the details of the hydrophobic molecule and its interactions with the water molecules around it. Unraveling the details of this interaction in the context of proteins is important in helping understand the fundamentals of this ubiquitous and important force, and in helping discover and design proteins to serve as new drugs or novel molecular machines.<br/><br/>How might one probe and understand the complexities of hydrophobicity? Artificial intelligence techniques are now ubiquitous in modern life, serving as recommendation engines for online shopping, automatically recognizing faces in camera phones, and enabling autonomous and assisted driving. Conventional computer programs work by executing a pre-programmed set of rules to achieve an outcome; modern artificial intelligence techniques are instead provided with a set of examples and automatically learn the rules from the data. This research project will use artificial intelligence techniques to learn the rules of hydrophobicity from computer simulations of water around proteins. Specifically, using sophisticated molecular simulations to model the interactions and dynamics of water molecules, and special tools to measure hydrophobicity, databases of the ""horror for water"" of different regions of the protein surface will be compiled. Artificial intelligence tools will then analyze these databases to find a mathematical model between hydrophobicity and the chemical composition and shape of the protein surface. The models learned in this way will help untangle the complexities of hydrophobicity, and can be used to quickly predict how proteins in water will behave. The tools will also be adapted and analyzed to provide human-interpretable explanations that help provide new understanding of hydrophobicity rather than just furnishing a complicated mathematical model.<br/><br/>These research activities will provide new models and understanding of protein hydrophobicity that can be used to search for new drug molecules and engineer proteins with new structures and functions. The simulation and artificial intelligence tools will be made broadly available to the scientific community and general public through open source molecular simulation packages, free software libraries, and through online code sharing sites. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research projects through 10-week paid summer internships to be offered in each year of the award. These research experiences will be designed according to best practices in providing authentic and valuable training experiences, and special efforts will be made to recruit students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This EAGER award supports research and education involving a new collaboration kindled at the MATDAT18 Datathon event focused on integrating sophisticated molecular simulation tools with machine learning techniques to understand hydrophobicity at the nanoscale. The hydrophobic effect - the tendency for non-polar moieties to cluster together and exclude water molecules in aqueous solvent - plays an important role in the interactions and assemblies of complex molecules, such as cavitands, dendrimers, and proteins. However, quantifying the hydrophobicity of such molecules, which display complex chemical and topographical patterns at the nanoscale, has proven to be an enduring and open challenge. Recent work has illuminated the failure of additive approaches that attempt to break down molecular hydrophobicity as a sum of the hydrophobicities of the constituent surface groups, and demonstrated that hydrophobicity at the nanoscale is a complex, collective, many-body response of hydration waters to chemical and topographical surface cues. This complexity not only frustrates a fundamental molecular understanding of hydrophobicity at the nanoscale, but also has important practical consequences, such as the inability to accurately screen ligands for drug discovery.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research project is to conduct enhanced sampling molecular simulations to accurately quantify the hydrophobicity of an extensive library of nanostructured surfaces through the free energy of cavity formation, and to deploy supervised machine learning techniques to unveil new understanding of the physical, chemical, and topographical cues governing surface hydrophobicity. The central hypothesis of this project is that the application of data-centric tools can provide new understanding of the molecular determinants of hydrophobicity beyond what is possible with simple conceptual models and human intuition. The first objective of this work is to quantify the hydrophobicity of an extensive library of patterned self-assembled monolayer surfaces and proteins by estimating the free energy of interfacial cavity formation using enhanced sampling techniques. The second objective is to conduct supervised learning over the hydrophobicity libraries to construct quantitative structure property relationship models relating chemical composition and physical structure to the free energy of interfacial cavity formation. A number of machine learning techniques will be explored, including support vector machines, random forests, partial least squares regression, and artificial neural networks. The techniques will be adapted to be physics-aware by ""baking in"" the physics of hydrophobicity into the model, and to be explainable by furnishing human-interpretable understanding of their behaviors.<br/><br/>Successful completion of this research will have impacts in both materials and data science. From a materials science perspective, unveiling the molecular determinants of protein hydrophobicity - the relation between the topographical and chemical patterns displayed by the protein and the free energy of cavity formation - will shed new light on the driving force behind protein interactions and assembly, furnish precepts for rational engineering of protein structure and function, and open up applications in virtual high-throughput screening for the computational discovery of drugs, ligands, bioseparation agents, and co-solutes to modulate protein solubility. From a data science perspective, this work will establish new physics/chemistry-aware machine learning tools whose behaviors are more interpretable and comprehensible in the analysis of molecular behaviors than generic off-the-shelf techniques.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Starting in the 1990s the field has been benefited from the rapidly evolving and expanding field of machine learning. The intelligent systems that have been borne out of machine learning, such as search engines, recommendation platforms, and speech and image recognition software, have become an indispensable part of modern society.  Rooted in statistics and relying heavily on the efficiency of numerical algorithms, machine learning techniques capitalize on increasingly powerful computing platforms and the availability of very large datasets.  One of the pillars of machine learning is mathematical optimization, which, in this context, involves the computation of parameters for a system designed to make decisions based on yet unseen data. The goal of this project is to develop new optimization algorithms that will enable the continuing rise of the field of machine learning.<br/>  <br/>The research consists of two projects, which are thematically related and address the solution of optimization problems that are nonlinear, high dimensional, stochastic, involve very large data sets and in some cases are non-convex. Two families of algorithms will be developed to garner the benefits of both stochastic gradient methods and batch methods, while avoiding their shortcomings. One of these algorithms uses a gradient aggregation approach that re-uses gradient values computed at previous iterations. The challenge is to design an algorithm that is efficient in minimizing testing error, not just training error. The second approach employs adaptive sampling techniques to reduce the noise in stochastic gradient approximations as the optimization progresses. An important aspect of this research is the design of an efficient strategy for incorporating second-order information that captures curvature of the optimized loss function, even in the case when Hessian estimates are based on inaccurate gradients. In all cases, the goal is research is to design and implement algorithms in software, and test them on realistic machine learning applications."

The materials within the cell are separated and protected from the environment by the cell membrane that is composed of molecules derived from fatty acids.  These molecules function well under relatively benign natural conditions, such as in water at room temperature and pressure. Under harsh environments, such as extreme temperatures and pressures prevalent in industrial processes, these molecules are unstable therefore making it difficult to deploy cells within such environments.  Furthermore, it is difficult to engineer natural membrane molecules with new functions such as the ability to sense their environment or bind particular surfaces or target molecules.  It is the primary goal of this work to discover and synthesize a new class of molecules based on proteins as an alternative 'chassis' material for synthetic cell membranes that have improved mechanical and chemical stability and can be engineered to endow the membrane with new functions.  Profs. Ferguson and Liu combine fast experimental synthesis and testing with computer simulations and artificial intelligence tools to search for new synthetic membranes with the ability to survive in harsh environments and the capacity to assemble synthetic cells together into synthetic tissues.  By combining experiment and computation within a virtuous cycle, wherein computation guides experiment and experiment informs computational modeling, massive savings in labor, time, and resources are realized compared to traditional trial-and-improvement experimentation.  In the course of this work, Profs. Ferguson and Liu provide research opportunities for post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high-school trainees, incorporate the outcomes of the research into classes that they teach, and engage in outreach activities through a Girls in Science and Engineering summer camp, Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, and University of Chicago After School Matters summer internship program.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The aim of this work is to discover novel peptidic biomaterials as an alternative ""chassis"" material for synthetic cells.  While biology has settled on using lipid bilayer membrane as the material for compartmentalizing cytoplasm and for membrane-bound organelles, polypeptides offer an alternative biomaterial that can establish peptidic microcompartments with improved mechanical and chemical stability and the capacity for additional engineered biological function.  Peptidic chassis materials offer unique advantages compared to lipid and polymersome membrane materials in terms of biocompatibility, chemical and mechanical stability, and capacity for additional functionalization that make them extremely desirable for applications in biomedicine, drug delivery, biosensing, and deployment in non-natural environments.  The discovery of peptide sequences capable of spontaneous self-assembly into solute-filled microcompartments with desired materials properties is frustrated by the vast size of the protein sequence search space that makes exhaustive exploration intractable and Edisonian trial-and-improvement inefficient.  In this work, we establish an integrated data-driven modeling and high-throughput cell-free synthesis platform to rapidly traverse sequence space.  In a tightly integrated feedback loop between theory and modeling, we employ an 'active learning' paradigm to extract information from experimental data, guide rational traversal of the vast peptide sequence space, and optimally deploy experimental resources.  Completion of this work will lead to the discovery of highly sought-after peptide-based synthetic cell 'chassis materials' that are more robust to harsh environments and which have complementary binding functionality to enable self-organization of the synthetic cells into synthetic tissues.  In the course of this work, Profs. Ferguson and Liu offer research opportunities for high-school and undergraduate students to provide exposure to scientific research and improve representation in the STEM pipeline, train graduate and post-doctoral trainees in integrated computational and experimental research, incorporate the scientific outcomes in course materials, and engage in outreach activities through a Girls in Science and Engineering summer camp, Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, and University of Chicago After School Matters summer internship program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is cofunded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research. Proteins are molecular workhorses that perform the essential functions of life.  Proteins have evolved to adopt shapes that enable them to do these tasks. Determining the shape and motions of a protein can help reveal how it works and inform how to design new proteins to help treat disease, produce biofuels, or make new materials. Computer simulations of proteins are very useful in that they can identify the precise locations and motions of all the constituent atoms. For all but the smallest proteins, however, it is too computationally intensive to accurately predict their structure and motions even with powerful supercomputers. Ways to accelerate these simulations have been developed, but to work well they need good estimates of the structural rearrangements that the protein will make. This is a problem, since this is usually the question the simulations are trying to answer. In this work, Professor Ferguson is developing a new approach to accelerate protein folding simulations using a type of machine learning known as artificial neural networks so-called because they are based on the structure of neurons in the brain.  Neural networks allow computers to both determine these important structural pathways and use them to make simulations run faster. This new approach is being used to help understand large proteins involved in cancer and HIV infection.  It is also being incorporated into popular simulation software available for free public download. Professor Ferguson is providing research opportunities for undergraduates to work with him on this project and he is developing hands-on workshops in computational materials science as part of the Girls Learning About Materials (GLAM) summer camp at the University of Illinois. <br/><br/>The aim of this work is to establish a nonlinear machine learning approach to discover collective variables for protein folding and to use these variables to perform enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics simulations. The success of enhanced sampling techniques in accelerating conformational sampling is predicated on the availability of good collective variables (CVs) correlated with important molecular motions. Existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., diffusion maps, Isomap, land ocally linear embedding) can ably discover good CVs, but do not furnish the explicit coordinate mapping so that biased sampling must be conducted inefficiently and indirectly in proxy variables. This work establishes a new enhanced sampling approach based on auto-associative artificial neural networks (""autoencoders"") to discover CVs that are explicit differentiable functions of the atomic coordinates and to permit calculation of analytical biasing forces. This approach is termed MESA (Molecular Enhanced Sampling with Autoencoders). MESA is validated on the short peptides alanine dipeptide and tryptophan-cage, and deployed to discover metastable states and structural transitions in a kinase overexpressed in many cancers and an envelope protein presented on the surface of HIV. MESA is made broadly available to the molecular simulation community by collaborating with the developers of OpenMM and PLUMED to contribute the approach to future releases of these software packages. Positive research experiences have great benefits for undergraduate success and retention and this work supports 10-week summer research opportunities during each year of the award. Professor Ferguson is also developing new and exciting content for the highly successful Girls Learning About Materials (GLAM) summer camp at the University of Illinois to illustrate and promote computational materials science among female high school students and elevate female enrollment in STEM degree programs."

In addition, often the available information, as, for example, in weather prediction, is not exact (deterministic) but statistical (random) with large fluctuations. On macroscopic scales that are much larger than the ones of the heterogeneities, the models often show an effective deterministic behavior, which is much simpler than the original one. The process of the averaging is known as homogenization. Mathematically, this means that the original random and inhomogeneous problem is replaced by a deterministic and homogeneous one. When this averaging is not possible, which is typically the case when the fluctuations are too strong (wild), it is necessary to deal with stochastic media (stochastic partial differential equations), which have rather singular behavior in space and time.  The mathematical study of both the stochastic averaging and the stochastic partial differential equations requires original ideas and the development of new methodologies, since both topics fall outside the traditional theories of averaging and partial differential equations.  Another burgeoning area of research is the theory of mean field games. Applications that have been so far looked at range from complex socio-economical topics, regulatory financial issues, crowd movement, meaningful big data and advertising to engineering contexts involving ""decentralized intelligence'"" and machine learning. Mean field games are the ideal mathematical structures to study the quintessential problems in the social-economical sciences, which differ from physical settings because of the forward looking behavior on the part of individual agents. Concrete examples of applications in this direction include the modeling of the macroeconomy and conflicts in the modern era. In both cases, a large number of agents interact strategically in a stochastically evolving environment, all responding to partly common and partly idiosyncratic incentives, and all trying to simultaneously forecast the decision of others. Training of graduate students is an integral part of this research project.<br/><br/>The project is about developing general methodologies to study random homogenization, nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations and applications to front propagation, phase transitions, and mean field games. Random environments are much more general than periodic ones. The latter are basically fixed translations of a certain equation while the former can be thought as all the possible equations. This leads to considerable issues of lack of compactness. It is therefore necessary to develop novel tools that combine both the differential and random structures of the media. In this setting, the equation is the random variable and the special dependence signifies the location in space where the equation is observed. The PI and his collaborators were the first to consider stochastic homogenization in stationary ergodic environments. A large part of the project is about the further development of the theory.  Stochastic partial differential equations have coefficients with very singular (Brownian) behavior. In the linear context, this can be typically handled by known methods like the classical martingale approach. The latter is based on the linear character of the higher order part of the equation and thus cannot be used for nonlinear problems, where it is necessary to find appropriate notions of solutions. In the context of first- and second-order nonlinear equations, these are the stochastic viscosity and pathwise entropy solutions, introduced by the PI and his collaborators.  A part of the project is about the study of the qualitative behavior/properties of these solutions. In the context of mean field games, the PI will concentrate on the role of inhomogeneities at the several level of the game up to the master equation and models with common noise. This will require the development of novel techniques to understand the behavior of the problem past singularities and the role of the averaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

STAGE, with its method of finding subtle parallels and metaphors between scientific themes and human experience, is translating the richness and nuances of this topic into a relatable form of expression. Participants include scientists, engineers, technology/media experts, professional artists (e.g., actors, directors, writers, dramaturgs, cinematographers, editors, as well as set, lighting, sound, projection, and costume designers), and undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars from all disciplines, all working simultaneously whenever possible. Much of the script is created through improvisation, and each improvisation is akin to running an experiment, i.e., the improvisation is used to generate and investigate new ideas, with continuous analysis and feedback. The project participants weigh and examine what each improvisation reveals, and, just as scientists analyze their results and use that information to revise an experiment, the project team adjust the circumstances of a scenario and improvise again to guide the creation of the script, as well as what will eventually be performed publicly. Moreover, the STAGE lab has a team of quantum physicists and nanotechnology experts actively collaborating on the theatre piece. Through this project, students, scientists, and the public engage with the University of Chicago students and faculty, the surrounding neighborhoods of Hyde Park, Chicago's South Side, and the greater Chicago area, all of which provide a diverse, multicultural audience, including underrepresented minority and at-risk students. By engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations and unique creative methods in the STAGE lab, UChicago's students sharpen qualities fundamental to their work: intuitive skills, the ability to think and act spontaneously, and imagination, all of which are invaluable to the practice of science.

The first is related to algebra and  number theory, and the second is in machine learning. Model theory is a part of mathematical logic which has seen extensive applications in other areas of mathematics and computer science in the last several decades. The project aims to resolve several long-standing problems related to number theory and algebraic differential equations. Number theory and differential equations are central areas of mathematics with applications throughout the sciences, and this project aims to resolve fundamental questions in these areas. Connections between model theory and machine learning have emerged in the last several years, and this project seeks to build on those connections to bring new techniques to both disciplines. In the past several years open problems in both model theory and machine learning have been resolved using techniques from the other, a process this project will continue. Machine learning has emerged as one of the most influential technologies of the last decade and is in the process of rapid growth, and this project aims to attack foundational problems in machine learning using techniques from mathematical logic. The education component of the project involves training of graduate students and undergraduate students through research and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>The first main area of this project centers around nonlinear ordinary differential equations which arise in a number of classical contexts. The project will study the differential equations satisfied by automorphic functions and apply the results to prove new transcendence results as well as obtaining diophantine applications around unlikely intersections. Here, the techniques include analysis, differential Galois theory, and geometric stability theory. Painleve equations will be studied, where the central goal is a classification of the algebraic relations between solutions. The second main area of this project is machine learning.

The discovery and design of new materials requires the ability to predict how different chemical elements can combine to make different compounds depending on the temperature. One example of great technological relevance are metallic alloys that form by combining multiple metallic elements at elevated temperatures. Over the past century, materials scientists have measured such compound-formation processes for many materials systems, but the available data still represents only a tiny fraction of the entire space of all possible combinations of chemical elements and temperatures. Meanwhile, machine-learning and data science have made great strides in discovering new patterns and connections, and being able to ?fill in? missing information from large data sets. The research team will extend and develop state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to apply to mathematical models and data for metallic alloys to learn new connections between chemical elements and discover new alloys. If successful, the research team will enable the development of new and improved lightweight structural alloys and longer-lived, higher power density batteries. All of the developed software tools will have publicly available implementations throughout the funding period to accelerate such developments. The research team?s approach uses close collaboration between domain and data scientists with strong ?cross-training? to develop the next generation of scientists and engineers, and data scientists enabling convergent approaches to the challenging problems of science and engineering.<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award brings together materials science and engineering, and data science to develop data-intensive methods to determine materials phase diagrams. Design and discovery of new materials relies extensively on phase diagrams that quantify what phase(s) are stable at a given temperature and chemical composition, which is determined by the free energy of different phases. Moreover, many equilibrium material properties are derived from free energies or free-energy differences. Extensive resources have been devoted to experimental determination of phase diagrams for many material systems, but despite these efforts only a tiny fraction of the entire space of possible materials has been explored. High-throughput computational approaches have added to our knowledge, but it is time-consuming to extrapolate from the easy-to-compute zero temperature results to experimentally relevant finite temperature results. While some qualitative chemical and structural trends have been identified?the periodic table being the most well-known example?leveraging this for quantitative predictions is difficult. Simultaneously, significant developments in machine learning have expanded the range of non-linear functions that can be interpolated with uncertainty quantification, advanced the field of dimensionality reduction, and revealed new underlying patterns in data. Continual expansion of computational and experimental open data sets of materials thermodynamics presents a tipping point where constructing machine-learned models for thermodynamic extrapolation becomes feasible, and offers a significant advance beyond high-throughput methods alone.<br/><br/>The research team will develop a novel thermodynamic machine learning engine and demonstrate it for the modeling of materials at relevant conditions with a focus on: (1) lightweight metallic alloys to predict phase diagrams at new compositions, and (2) extending to native oxide thermodynamics. The PIs will employ a combination of semi-supervised learning, a generative adversarial network framework for discriminative and generative learning, and functional quantile learning including uncertainty quantification. If successful, the thermodynamic machine learning engine can be expanded to other material spaces including high-temperature alloys, and battery and fuel cell materials. It can drive future high-throughput computation and experiment. The team will interact with TRIPODS centers for dissemination, discussions, and collaborations as it develops deeper connections with data science driven by the challenges of domain science and engineering.<br/><br/>Developing an accurate, predictive, and computationally efficient free energy function for the full range of materials space is a transformative innovation for the design and discovery of materials. The underlying dimensionality reduction inherent in the universal free energy function permits the discovery of new relationships between chemical elements and solid phases, beyond existing qualitative relationships. Uncertainty quantification can identify unexplored but valuable regions of chemical and structure space to provide a new paradigm for high-throughput computation and experimental methods to optimally expand our knowledge of materials and chemical relationships. The data science innovations will extend the scope of Gaussian process-based modeling, enable machine learning with functional data and couple it with recent advances in data-depth, advance generative adversarial networks and related Bayesian studies for functional data generative models with uncertainty quantification, and extend quantile regression to function-valued responses.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division, and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major milestone in the understanding of protein behavior emerged with the advent of the ""new view"" of protein folding. This perspective conceives of protein structure, stability, and dynamics as governed by a molecular-level landscape not unlike a relief map describing the surface of the Earth. Each point on the landscape - analogous to latitude and longitude - corresponds to a particular spatial arrangement of protein atoms. The altitude of each point on the map defines protein stability - unstable conformations lie on mountaintops and stable conformations within valley floors. Determining these landscapes is a key goal of protein biology since they are useful in the understanding of natural proteins and design of synthetic proteins as drugs, enzymes, and molecular machines. It is relatively straightforward to calculate these landscapes for small proteins using computer simulations, but it has not been possible to do so from experimental measurements. It is the primary objective of this research to combine mathematical tools from the modeling of dynamical systems with machine learning approaches to analyze high-dimensional datasets to determine approximate protein folding landscapes directly from experimental data. The approach will first be validated in computer simulations of small proteins where the folding landscape is known. Theoretical analyses will place bounds on how close the approximate landscapes are to the true landscapes, and place conditions on the experimental data required for their determination. Ultimately the approach will be applied to experimental measurements of a tuberculosis protein. The computational analysis tool will be released as user-friendly software for free public download. Positive research experiences have great benefits for undergraduate success and retention, and this award will support summer and academic year research opportunities. New educational outreach materials will be developed for the University of Illinois ""Engineering Open House"" to promote awareness of materials science and engineering among middle- and high-school students.<br/><br/>The aim of this work is to integrate nonlinear manifold learning with dynamical systems theory to reconstruct protein folding landscapes from experimental time series measuring a single system observable. The ""new view"" of protein folding revolutionized understanding of folding as a conformational search over rugged and funneled free energy landscapes parameterized by a small number of emergent collective variables, with transformative implications for the understanding and design of proteins as drugs, enzymes, and molecular machines. It is now relatively routine to determine multidimensional folding landscapes from computer simulations in which all atomic coordinates are known, but it has not been possible to do so from experimental measurements of protein dynamics that are restricted to small numbers of coarse-grained observables. This research project integrates Takens' delay embeddings with nonlinear manifold learning using diffusion maps to first project univariate time series in an experimentally measurable observable into a high-dimensional space in which the dynamics are C1-equivalent to those in real space, and then extract from this space a topologically and geometrically equivalent reconstruction of the folding funnel to that which would have been determined from knowledge of all atomic coordinates. The reconstructed landscape preserves the topology of the true funnel - the metastable configurations and folding pathways - but the topography may be perturbed, i.e., the heights and depths of the free energy peaks and valleys. The three primary objectives of this work are to (i) validate the approach in molecular dynamics simulations of small proteins for which the true landscape is known, (ii) place conditions on the sampling resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in experimental measurements for robust landscape recovery, and theoretical bounds on the induced topographical perturbations, and (iii) apply the approach to experimental single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements on the lid-opening and closing dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase (Mtb-PtpB)."

The project focuses on complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), a class of novel alloys that mix atoms of different species at nearly equal ratios. The scientific drive for studying CCAs is to understand and utilize the vast chemical and structural design space associated with multiple elements in search of new materials properties. Current understanding about the stability, structures, and properties of alloys is limited to the corners and edges of the multi-element space, such as binary or dilute alloys. The information for CCAs close to the center of the composition space is virtually non-existent for systems with four or more elements. The project intends to fill this knowledge gap in alloy theory for these complex alloy systems by (i) establishing an accurate predictive understanding of the atomic structures in CCAs through a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and statistical mechanics methods, and (ii) integrating quantum mechanical calculations, empirical models and close-loop machine learning methods to predict the structural and defect features in CCAs for accelerated design of CCAs for structural or functional applications.

Severe lattice distortion is an important phenomenon that is correlated to a variety of physical and chemical properties in CCAs. However, the nature of severe lattice distortions in CCAs is poorly understood, especially with the coupling of SRO. The PI will study SRO and related lattice distortions in CCAs with a unique synergy of mechanism investigation, predictive modeling, and methodology development. The research will elucidate SRO on the structures of lattice distortions in CCAs, which will be utilized to quantify the impact of the distorted lattices on the phonon characteristics of CCAs. Results and methodology from bulk CCAs will be applied to establish a predictive mapping linking defect characteristics with local environments in CCAs, providing the foundation for computational design of CCAs for superior mechanical properties.

Our understanding and modeling of the large-scale dynamics of the Earth climate system and associated regional-scale climate variability significantly affects our ability to predict and mitigate climatic extremes and hazards. Earth observations and climate model outputs are witnessing an unprecedented increase in data volume, creating new opportunities to advance climate science but also leading to new data science challenges that must be addressed using tools from mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This project focuses on two central challenges at the heart of modern data-enabled climate science: (1) Increasing the predictive capacity of subseasonal forecasts by discovering and quantifying the sources of (un)predictability, including known and emergent climate modes and their interactions and non-stationarities; and (2) Understanding and quantifying the intricate space-time dynamics of the climate system to provide guidance for climate model assessment and regional forecasting.  This project brings together an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in both hydroclimate science and statistical machine learning to create new platforms for climate diagnostics and prognostics.  The broader impacts of an enhanced knowledge of the climate system and robust and accurate seasonal forecasts have wide-ranging implications for society as a whole. For example, better seasonal forecasts will allow water resource managers to make sustainable decisions for water allocation.<br/><br/>This TRIPODS+CLIMATE project will develop novel machine learning and network estimation methodologies for analyzing the climate system over a range of space and time scales, to understand climate modes of variability and change and to explore their predictive ability for regional hydroclimatology. The two main objectives of this project are the following.  Objective 1: Develop novel classification and regression tools that account for highly-correlated features or covariates, nonlinear interaction terms in high-dimensional settings, and nonstationarity in climate observations. These tools will be used to improve seasonal-to-subseasonal forecasts of regional precipitation using multidimensional climate modes and feature vectors in the presence of evolving dynamics and nonstationarities. Objective 2: Develop network identification methods that leverage recent advances in machine learning and statistics and that can account for the nonstationarity and limited timeframe of climate data. The network representation will be used to analyze the structure and dynamics of the learned dependencies to contextualize and interpret them physically, and to quantify changing patterns in climate modes and their regional predictive capacity.  Emphasis will be placed on the western Pacific dynamics where an interhemispheric bi-directional connection has recently been discovered, promising earlier and more accurate seasonal-to-subseasonal forecasts in the southwestern US and other parts of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems arise in different areas of science and engineering, including massive data analysis, machine learning, signal processing, medical image reconstruction, statistics, traffic and logistical networks, and operations research. Most of them share the irregular phenomenon of nonsmoothness or nonconvexity that challenges computation. Despite several practically successful algorithms recently proposed to solve such problems, the underlying fundamental theory is not quite understood and explored. Only analyzing the complexity and the deep mathematics behind these problems and algorithms provides practitioners across related, vital science and engineering areas new tools to comprehend their core features, be able to design more efficient algorithms, and attack more challenging problems arising from practice. The investigators develop such tools via a novel approach from a relatively young subfield of applied mathematics, variational analysis, which is naturally compatible with these nonsmooth and complex structures. Several topics from this project are integrated with teaching topic courses and training of students.<br/><br/>     This project is devoted to developing the theory of second-order variational analysis (SOVA) and using it to study the stability, sensitivity, and computational complexity of algorithms for solving structured optimization problems. The first part of this project serves as the theoretical foundation; it concerns the theory of SOVA with connections to stability and sensitivity analysis. More specifically, the investigators intend to study: (i) tilt stability and full stability for general optimization problems with connections to Robinson's strong regularity and Kojima's strong stability for conic programming via SOVA; (ii) metric (sub)regularity of the subdifferential and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property on nonsmooth (possibly nonconvex) functions via SOVA; and (iii) stability for parametric variational systems including Nash equilibrium systems and variational inequalities via SOVA. The second part of this project consists of designing and analyzing proximal algorithms for solving convex and nonconvex structured problems. Immediate applications include Lasso, group Lasso, elastic net, basic pursuit, sparsity, low-rank problems, and completion matrix problems that originate from compressed sensing, image reconstruction, machine learning, and data science. Stability theory developed in the first part plays a significant role here, especially in the complexity analysis of these algorithms. It explains why the development of many recent proximal algorithms is strongly influenced by the hidden power of SOVA. The specific objectives of this part are: (i) to accelerate the forward-backward splitting method and analyze the phenomenon of linear convergence encountered frequently in numerical experiments; and (ii) to design efficient methods of Douglas-Rachford splitting type for solving nonconvex optimization and feasibility problems. Other important applications include inverse problems corrupted by Poisson noise and total variation denoising models, both of which are well recognized in imaging science and statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Initially, the engine will predict if `killer' defects limit the available dopant range. The engine will ultimately grow to suggest specific extrinsic dopants for compounds that pass this initial screening.  Together, this combination of accurate predictions of intrinsic transport properties (prior DMREF) and dopability (proposed DMREF) is expected to accelerate the discovery process for thermoelectric materials."

Such multiscale models, at both the atomistic and coarse grain levels, contribute greatly to our understanding of how this virus replicates.   Molecular simulations of viral processes in COVID-19 are useful to identify possible weaknesses in the viral life cycle.  This research focuses on the dynamics of coronavirus processes, including the conformational transitions that are required for the virus to function. The project has three main foci:  1) all-atom simulations of individual viral proteins that are essential to the viral life cycle; 2) a coarse-grain models to a holistic understanding of entire virion (the virus outside the host cell) and its large scale processes, such as fusion of virions with host cells; and 3) machine-learning-based approaches to link the all-atom and coarse grain models and further refine their accuracy.  As part of a larger, international community working on COVID-19, all data, models and analysis code will be made publicly available as soon as they are developed, including through the NSF-funded Molecular Science Software Institute (MolSSI).   The complete multiscale picture of virus structure and dynamics will be used to identify potential target sites for drug development and other therapeutic strategies.<br/><br/><br/>The research in this RAPID project is for the development and application of multiscale computer simulation methods to characterize key elements of large-scale viral processes in SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The specific compounds of interest include oxides with transition metal cations, and focus on the effect that fluorine, which can substitute for oxygen in the materials, has on the electronic functionality. Previous research on transition metal oxides has established the importance of atomic structure engineering of electronic responses in many crystal families. Most conventional property-by-design routes rely, however, on changing the transition metal cation in oxides. This project seeks to apply another route - tuning the interactions in the crystal through anion (fluorine and oxygen) substitution. Changes in the geometry, arrangement and composition of the anion atoms will be explored through a confluence of materials theory techniques based on symmetry analyses, materials informatics (machine learning), and quantum mechanical calculations. The PI has ongoing collaborations with leading experts in synthesis and characterization of such materials composed of transition metals, oxygen, and fluorine; understanding derived here will stimulate experimental methods and vice versa. Continued investigation of known materials, while valuable, is inadequate to formulate strategies for deterministic property control. Knowledge obtained here will facilitate the selection and design of materials with tunable electronic states.

Conventional routes to direct the responses in transition metal oxides primarily rely on cation substitution and interfacial effects in thin films and superlattices, which offer limited control owing to a single (oxygen) anion - this makes materials discovery challenging. Remarkably, ligand (anion) engineering with mixed anion polyhedral building blocks remains to be fully exploited for property control and design, especially in these materials which already find use in energy generation and storage, phosphors, and catalysis.<br/> <br/>Combinations of applied group theory, informatics, and density functional theory calculations will be applied to achieve the main research objectives, which include (1) Advancing new theoretical methods to establish structure-function axioms for how anion order can be used to direct crystal structure and properties; (2) Formulating a quantitative theory of structure stability based on understanding the ligand sublattice symmetry and local bonding interactions; and (3) Understanding the consequences of mixed-anion polyhedral topologies on electronic properties. Structure-property axioms will be extracted by studying the consequences of anion substitution using oxyfluoride building blocks on physical properties in cryolite and elpasolite structures. With that knowledge, quantitative guidelines will be constructed to tailor electronic structure and properties in new oxyfluorides: metal-insulator transitions, electronic band gaps, and large non-linear optical responses. Success in this research will produce new knowledge underlying crystal stability, chemical bonding, and electronic behavior. It will articulate predictive rules for selecting new oxyfluorides, accelerate discovery, and enable an unprecedented expansion of compounds with varying electronic functions. Ultimately, interactions with experimental groups will lead to the discovery of functional properties in structurally and chemically more complex (hybrid) organic and inorganic materials than those proposed. Such collaborations will ensure that the virtual predictions translate into realistic models and new materials, which may transform the discovery process for materials deployed in glasses, phosphors, fuel-conversion, and Li-ion batteries technologies.<br/><br/>This project will further the educational opportunities of students at Northwestern University and other academic institutions, precollege students, and contribute to the professional development of high school teachers.

One of the fundamental questions in modern data science is how to efficiently process massive data sets with minimal information loss to aid scientific discovery and decision making.  This has led the scientific community to adopt approximate statistical procedures that achieve the optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical efficiency.  On the one hand, the approximation should be tractable to gain computational benefits. On the other hand, the approximation needs to be tight, so as to not compromise much in terms of the statistical optimality of the original problem. This project aims to bridge the computational and theoretical gaps in various statistical problems under complex and nonstandard settings. The results of the proposed research will significantly impact areas known for applying computationally intensive methods on a routine basis.  These include population genetics, astronomy, computer vision, political science, social science, and animal science.<br/><br/>Recent developments in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning focus on exploring the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the problem. This poses new challenges in terms of both statistical optimality and computational efficiency.  Variational inference is a technique that addresses both challenges by seeking a variational approximation to the original problem that is not only tractable, but also tight.  However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation of variational inference from both the computational and statistical perspective.  The goals of the project include: (1) theoretical investigations of variational Bayesian procedures; and (2) variational optimization strategies in robust estimation.  The project's success will help bridge the computational and theoretical gaps in modern data science and lead to significant theoretical and computational advances in variational inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decision Trees are an important type of predictive modelling method. They have a long history and modern variations like random forest are among the most powerful techniques available. One part of the project would develop new and theoretically sound decision trees accompanied by software implementation. The other part of the project applies to signal processing. Total Variation Denoising is a popular method used in image processing to do noise removal. The current algorithm as it stands, is not fully automated. This project would develop a fully automated version of this algorithm which is theoretically valid. In the bigger picture, the research would generate improved versions of these time tested algorithms and our understanding of how and why they work would be refined. <br/><br/><br/>A main focus of the project is to study non parametric estimation of non smooth functions such as piecewise constant/linear/polynomial functions, in high dimensions. One major agenda here is to give theoretical guarantees for CART like estimators. These guarantees would provably demonstrate adaptivity to the number and arrangement of rectangular level sets of the regression function. Theoretical understanding of such adaptivity for CART like estimators are largely absent in the literature and this research should be a first step towards filling this gap. In this project, an extension of the Dyadic CART estimator, called Model Selection Cart (MS Cart) is proposed as a computationally and theoretically tractable method to achieve the desired adaptivity. We have already developed an algorithm (to be implemented and made publicly available), based on a dynamic programming approach, which provably computes the MS Cart estimator efficiently. We are currently working on showing theoretical guarantees for MS Cart. Another main focus of the proposal is to study the methodology of Total Variation Denoising (TVD). This technique is a non linear image denoising technique heavily used in the image processing community. The first problem talked about in this proposal, under this topic, is a step towards rigorous understanding of the statistical risk of the TVD estimator. Worst case analysis of this risk is now well understood in the literature. The research proposed here will go beyond worst case analysis and reveal the adaptivity of the TVD estimator. The second proposed problem deals with the very practical issue of choosing the tuning parameter for TVD in a fully data driven way. A new tuning parameter free estimator is proposed here whose practical performance has been thoroughly checked by us in simulations. We will show that our proposed estimator is minimax rate optimal while being fully data driven. Such an estimator is not available in the literature, as of now. This estimator has the potential to make the TVD methodology much more user friendly than it already is as choosing a tuning parameter can be a delicate issue. The PI will also address several non parametric estimation problems in settings such as quantile regression and in general exponential families. In particular, one agenda here is to study shape constrained estimation in quantile regression which would be a first step towards going beyond restrictive linear assumptions often made in the existing literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Denmark of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Professor Denmark is developing a new paradigm for the development of catalysts that combines the creative power of ""diversity-oriented synthesis"" with the computational power of informatics. Under the data-driven discovery science in Chemistry (D3SC) initiative, the foundation of this program is the invention and implementation of high-resolution descriptors that are able to accurately reflect the chemical properties of molecules in a form that is readable by a computer. The current state of the art is insufficient to provide the level of granularity needed to assure that the properties of computer generated libraries of hypothetical catalysts are accurate reflections of the true character of the molecules. Most importantly, however, the development of a truly general, computationally guided workflow for the optimization of molecular function can impact the entire spectrum of chemical properties from optimizing the performance of functional materials (sensors, LEDs, adhesives, energy storage systems, etc.) to the discovery and optimization of catalysts for industrially relevant chemical processes.<br/><br/>The goals of this proposal are summarized in the basic components of a discovery oriented program that combines computational analysis with experimentation, namely: (1) in-silico generation of a massive library of hypothetical catalyst structures based on a given scaffold followed by calculation of descriptors of each library member, (2) diversity analysis to generate representative ""training set"", (3) synthesis of training set, (4) evaluation of the training set in a given reaction, (5) development and validation of a mathematical model that correlates empirical output with molecular properties (6) application of that model to the virtual library of catalysts, (7) synthesis and evaluation of best predicted catalysts, and (8) repeat steps 4-8 until desired output is achieved. Great potential exists for 3D-Quantitative Structure Selectivity Relationship (3D-QSSR) modeling to impact asymmetric catalysis, not only by identifying high performance catalyst structures, but also by providing a new framework to elucidate the structural features that govern the activity and enantioselectivity of catalysts for any given chemical transformation. Most importantly, this framework should be universally applicable to the optimization of any kind of molecular property or function. These activities are ideal for the intellectual and practical training of graduate students and postdoctoral coworkers. The interplay of theory and experiment is the essence of the scientific method. Students are presented with hypotheses for the outcome of planned experiments and they must learn to collect and interpret data to substantiate or eliminate the hypothesis. They also become expert synthetic chemists, proficient scientific programmers, and competent in computational chemistry, data-science, and machine learning. The unifying theme of this activity is the development of a computationally guided workflow that leads to the creation of universally applicable training sets of molecules that can be used to optimize myriad chemical reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Less than two years later, over the span of 12 hours on August 17, 2017, the field of gravitational- wave multi-messenger astronomy was born with the detection of both gravitational-waves and light from the collision of two neutron stars. Over the next years many additional collisions will be detected, and this project will explore what these sources will teach us about physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The project focuses on learning about how the distribution of the masses of the detected systems help us understand how the Universe makes black holes and neutron stars. This relates to how the Universe makes stars, which in turn relates to how the universe makes the elements which are crucial to life. In addition to exploring these fascinating questions and publishing results to help move the field forward, the group will also perform extensive education and outreach activities related to gravitational-waves and black holes.<br/><br/>The project will analyze the source catalogs and determine underlying population distributions. The PI will examine the mass distribution of the component compact objects in the detected binaries. In particular, the PI will explore both the putative lower mass gap (between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole), as well as the upper mass gap (a dearth of black holes of mass 50 solar masses ). Similarly, the PI will explore the spin and mass ratio distributions of the population, as well as the redshift evolution of all of these distributions. Characterizing these distributions, and their evolution, will teach us about the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars, as well as binaries that contain them. As our understanding of the distributions improves, the ability to characterize outliers from these underlying distributions also improves. The PI will further study this process, both highlighting the nature of outliers, as well as developing population-based parameter estimation.

A year after the initial discovery, a group of researchers demonstrated that the high electric fields produced by a laser pulse converted the light passing through a quartz crystal from one color to another (red to green) via a nonlinear optical (NLO) process called second-harmonic generation. Since then, NLO materials like quartz have played a key role in advancing frontiers in laser science. NLO activity and other exciting properties are allowed in materials where inversion symmetry in broken, which are known as noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids. Through this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, Prof. Poeppelmeier's group at Northwestern University advances the understanding how chemistry can be used to create materials with broken inversion symmetry and connect atomic structure to properties. A variety of synthetic approaches are used to control the alignment of the building blocks that make up a crystal structure. Their growth of large, high-quality crystals of NCS materials enables detailed investigation of the connection between atomic structure and properties in NCS materials.

These synthetic efforts are guided by chemical knowledge as well as machine learning methods that elucidate important trends from large amounts of experimental data. The growth of large, high-quality crystals enables structural characterization with single crystal and powder x-ray diffraction along with NLO and other property measurements to determine structure-property relationships.

The approach extends to a robust modeling approach in case of model failures that can occur when covering a large study domain. In particular, the research team will develop Gaussian process-based emulator that models both the sparsely observed computer model and the unknown discrepancy that explains the gap between the model and reality. The approach is Bayesian which provides for the natural quantification of uncertainties. The key tool for statistical inference is to replace the standard practice of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with a novel usage of variational Bayes (VB) inference. While the variational Bayes is popular in machine learning literature, the technique is not as popular in statistics as MCMC based sampling techniques. The slow uptake the VB framework seems to be due to the additional complexities it adds to modeling and the relatively uncharted theoretical properties. This project develops an innovative VB algorithm to resolve the present issues in computer model calibration with the aim of improving the computation scalability and extendibility in a robust modeling approach.

It interrupts businesses, and even poses risks to environment and public safety. Protecting power systems from large-scale outages is no doubt a top priority. Early detection of random component failures and prediction of cascading failures are critical to the prevention of large-scale blackouts, but they can be achieved only when the power grid is equipped with adequate capability for system understanding, situational awareness, and emergency response. Modern power systems are becoming increasingly complex with the addition of a variety of active controllers, renewable energy resources and storages. With the complexity and uncertainty involved, traditional approaches based on intensive computation to solve a system of model equations are no longer suitable for real-time analysis and control. One graduate student will be support in year 1 of this award.<br/><br/>In this project, we leverage recent advances in data science to improve power systems reliability, security, and resilience. In particular we propose to use deep neural networks and data-driven uncertainty quantification, to advance the core algorithms pertaining to the analysis and control of power systems. The proposed work includes three major thrusts: (1) real-time power flow analysis, (2) real-time anomaly detection and causal analysis, and (3) real-time contingency analysis and optimal emergency control.

By making use of structures with well-defined geometric features, it is possible to directly interpret the electrochemical data.

Typical electrochemical structures incorporate random, high-surface area features to maximize overall performance and are not well-suited to extraction of fundamental behavior. In contrast, geometrically well-defined systems enable determination of properties such as length-specific triple-phase boundary activity, bulk chemical diffusion coefficient, area-specific surface activity, and much more. These are essential parameters for the deliberate engineering of high-performance structures. The painstaking nature of acquiring such data using individually prepared samples has, however, limited the study of geometrically well-defined electrochemical systems to a few important examples, despite growing recognition of its value. In this project, advanced fabrication tools are utilized to create libraries of electrode structures on electrolyte substrates and rapidly measure the entire contents of each library using an in-house constructed, unique scanning electrochemical probe system. Computational tools are developed to handle the massive quantities of data generated, including data mining and machine learning capabilities to create efficiencies in data acquisition and analysis. Libraries of geometrically graded microdot electrodes are complemented with selected compositionally-graded libraries, with the compositional space identified to further elucidate rate-limiting steps. Electrochemical studies are complemented with a broad suite of physical and chemical characterization methods to provide a comprehensive picture of material behavior as relevant to electrocatalysis. Generation of new insights into electrochemical reaction pathways is an essential step in the creation of next-generation electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices and as such has an important role in a sustainable energy future."

Such datasets offer exciting opportunities to make better decisions and reveal new discoveries to improve decision making in various applications, and meanwhile, also raise statistical challenges. Over the past decades, regularization methods such as Lasso, SCAD, and MCP have been proposed to conduct model estimation in the presence of high dimensional covariates. Various numerical algorithms have been developed for these methods, and their theoretical properties are well studied. However, questions of how to efficiently and effectively utilize high-dimensional data to make optimal decisions and conduct inference are relatively less studied, although such problems are of vital practical importance. This project will develop new methods and theories for making optimal decisions and conducting valid inference under high-dimensional settings. The methods have wide applications, for instance, in personalized medicine where the goal is to determine the optimal treatments for a patient based on predictor information, including several thousand genetic markers. The principal investigators will develop and distribute user-friendly open-source software to practitioners and provide training opportunities to students at different levels. <br/><br/>The project has three research aims. The first aim is to study the high-dimensional contextual bandit problem with binary actions, which is an online decision-making problem that finds applications in personalized healthcare and precision medicine. In this problem, the player sequentially chooses one action and observes a reward, where the goal is to maximize the reward. The principal investigators will develop a new algorithm to provide an optimal decision rule, which achieves the minimax optimal regret. The second aim is to study general inference problems that arise from high-dimensional stochastic convex optimization, where the goal is to quantify the uncertainties of the optimal objective value. The third goal is to consider the general stochastic linear bandit problem with a finite and random action space.

Examples include the search for a subpopulation of patients who most benefit from a given treatment, the identification of subsets of mutations that characterize different tumor cell subpopulations that could then serve as possible treatment targets, or the discovery of latent disease patterns in electronic health records that could be used to propose an improved allocation of resources.  In all three examples, the unusual nature of the inference targets as random subsets gives rise to challenging data analysis problems. In contrast, most traditional methods work for inference targets that are a single number, like a treatment effect, a level of differential protein expression, or a mean response.  This project aims to address this gap in currently available methodology by developing and applying new methods to solve several specific inference problems related to random subsets.<br/><br/>This project develops novel statistical inference methods for random subsets to approach such inference problems by explicitly introducing parsimony and interpretability as criteria for the reported inference. Related methods are developed for random partitions, feature allocation, and extensions of such structures. Besides the development of models and inference paradigms, a second major thrust of the proposed work is the development of computationally feasible implementations for large data sets. Model-based Bayesian inference for random subsets quickly leads to prohibitively computation-intensive implementations when simulation-exact posterior Monte Carlo methods are used. While several big data posterior simulation methods for global parameters have been developed in recent literature, there are few such methods for random subsets, i.e., local parameters.

They are utilized mainly in biomedical applications. They undergo a structural transformation under the application of temperature or stress. Under repeated transformations or cyclic loadings, shape memory alloys can undergo mechanical fatigue. Fatigue is the progressive deterioration of metals under cyclic loading, resulting in damage due to cracking and ultimately failure. This can negatively affect the actuation performance in many applications. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to advance the science-based knowledge of fatigue progression in such alloys by developing a fundamental approach to estimate the fatigue threshold stress intensity as a function of key material parameters.  The work will address how the material variables affect the macroscopic fatigue parameters such  controlling crack advance.  <br/>The impact of this work is to remove the empiricism associated with fatigue threshold determination in shape memory materials. The proposed modeling will reveal understanding  that can advance prediction of fatigue damage. This research will examine the most important shape memory material NiTi which is not well understood, and then consider new classes of promising alloys that currently remain untested. The proposed research recognizes the need for revamping education in this field with outreach efforts to high school students. A novel project is proposed to build a small fatigue machine using rapid prototyping methodology. The students will learn how to build the machine during the summer camp and observe the failure of  alloy wires under fatigue. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Fundamental understanding of shape memory alloy (SMA) fatigue damage tolerance has not been established despite the significance of these alloys. The lack of understanding of fatigue hinders the widespread use of SMAs and has confined SMA utilization to very few compositions. This project is an effort on modeling from atomistic to micro- mechanical scales to develop a superior understanding of fatigue thresholds in shape memory alloys (SMAs). This science-based methodology of fatigue-damage prediction is one of the challenges that the shape memory community faces especially under varying stress in endovascular stents and potential applications such as elastocaloric cooling where the SMAs could see thousands of cycles. The work requires deep knowledge of several fields- physics of fatigue, atomistic models and shape memory behavior. The proposal will utilize modeling at atomic scale via ab-initio calculations as well as molecular dynamics to understand: (i) the role of elastic anisotropy (including cubic, tetragonal and monoclinic lattices), (ii) the role of dislocation-mediated slip resulting in irreversibility, residual martensite, and residual austenites, and their role in producing crack closure forces. The alloys to be considered such as NiTi and CoNiAl exhibit different crystal lattices, ordering and transformation stresses as a function of composition and heat treatment. To verify the models at various length scales, electron microscopy in meso-scale fatigue experiments will be utilized. Only the confluence of these techniques can provide the needed insight to advance the current knowledge of mechanical fatigue of SMAs. <br/>This proposal will evaluate two shape memory alloy systems with experiments (NiTi and Co-Ni-Al with varying compositions). The proposed experiments consider very fine measurements of displacements at crack tips allowing determination of crack advance. Concurrently, the focus will be on theoretical developments to compute the crack closure forces due to transformation strains which will account for the elastic moduli tensors, anisotropy of internal tractions, and transformation and plasticity zones. The proposal plans to predict the fatigue crack advance under three different material conditions: (i) monolithic austenitic state (ii) martensitic state (detwinned and self-accommodated cases) and (iii) stress- induced transformation (austenite to martensite) conditions. The study of these three material conditions will provide a complete spectrum of understanding of SMA fatigue behavior. <br/>A novel project is proposed for students to build a small fatigue machine using rapid prototyping methodology and test SMA wires under high-speed rotation. The curvature of the wire dictates the strain amplitude and the rotation of the wire generates cyclic loading that alternates between tension and compression and ultimately results in fatigue failure. The students will learn how to build the machine during the summer camp and observe the failure of SMA wires under fatigue."

They are introduced to mimic the behavior of electron spins naturally occurring in magnetic materials. Instead of focusing on bar magnets, each of the nanobars can be 'broken up' into a positive and negative magnetic charges, enabling to design an artificial spin structure that produces a magnetic charge ice with reconfigurable charge configurations. When an artificial-spin-ice structure is placed onto a superconducting thin film, its magnetic charges strongly interact with the flux quanta in the superconductor, enabling the realization of various disordered and crystallized flux quanta states. The different states have measurable effects on the superconducting critical current profile, which can be reconfigured by precise selection of the spin ice magnetic state through application of an external magnetic field. This research provides a foundation for understanding and manipulating the new complex and collective effects that are expected in the flux quanta system in a controllable way.

A paradigm system with geometric frustration is spin ice materials such as pyrochlores with 'two spins in, two spins out' spin configuration, which are magnetic analogues of the old problem of how hydrogen atoms order in the water ice lattice. Recently, an artificial spin structure has been developed to produce magnetic charge ices with in-situ tunable long-range ordering. This project is to investigate a hetero-structure consisting of such an artificial-spin structure on top of a superconducting thin film. Certain magnetic charge configurations of the spin structure lead to ordered arrangements of vortices in the superconducting film, whereas others frustrate the vortex ensemble. This research is to establish a new front in geometric frustration research by pursuing the experimental realization and novel properties of frustrated vortex matter. This project can lead to new approaches for in-situ tunable critical currents in a superconductor and novel superconducting devices such as vortex diodes. The coupling of an artificial-spin-structure with other functional materials provides a new setting for designing and controlling geometric frustrations in magnetic 'particle' systems, such as magnetic skyrmions and magnetic colloids. It also leads to an effective way to design in-situ reconfigurable functionalities and electronic devices in a wide range of electronic materials, such as graphene, topological insulators, and quantum wells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It takes inspiration from the fundamental processes that govern the structure and enormous adaptability of biological networks in order to derive new principles for pluripotent material fabrication by varying the training protocol.  The IRG on Activated Architectured Materials constructs materials with spatiotemporally programmable and self-regulating transport properties by bringing together recent advances in active materials with inorganic colloidal and thin film synthesis.  This work enables dynamic control of transport properties of inorganic materials with potential applications in sensing, actuation and biodesign. A Super-Seed on Materials for Electrical-Optical Quantum Transduction focuses on the challenge of creating integrated quantum circuits with coherent interfaces between different quantum materials spanning across many energy scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include patterned ultra-small antennas that modulate local electromagnetic field strengths upon different sun positions, or automotive ""skins"" that optimize the aerodynamics of vehicles in varying environments. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the Principal Investigator's NSF CAREER grant is focused on deciphering the rules upon which nanometer-sized building blocks self-organize and reorganize into such adaptive materials. These building blocks are chosen due to the unique potential for miniaturization and the collective properties determined by the structures they organize into. The key enabling innovations of this project are two-fold. First, a novel imaging tool will be used to trace and videotape the building block motions on the fly at up to atomic resolution. Second, the obtained motions will be analyzed to interpret the crosstalk among these building blocks. The obtained fundamental understanding can also be applied to other systems composed of tiny elementary objects such as biological molecules which are critical for human health, or to create new materials that can achieve cheap and clean renewable energy. The project provides training to both undergraduate and graduate students. A ""tri-M lab"" including Modular lab demos, a Mobile game app, and Movies is utilized as a platform for broad dissemination to the general public.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator's long-term goal is to transmute inanimate materials into animate ones, capable of reconfiguring their structure and property on demand. The key challenge in designing reconfigurable materials from nanoscale building blocks lies in understanding the kinetic pathways of their self-assembly. These pathways define how building blocks interact and assemble into targeted structures, i.e. the building block nanoscale interaction-targeted structure relationship. However, the kinetic pathways are associated with how building blocks continuously diffuse and tumble in a solvent, which is both spatiotemporally varying and nanoscopic in nature. Thus, fully understanding these pathways requires real-space, in-situ characterization with high spatiotemporal resolution, which is not offered by existing ex-situ and ensemble methods. The research objective of this CAREER proposal is thus to address this challenge and to quantify the interactions and kinetic pathways governing self-assembly and structural reconfiguration in model systems of anisotropic gold nanoparticles (NPs). The proposed approach is to combine the emergent liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with automated movie analysis methods developed in the PI's group to quantify the dynamics of NP self-assembly. Specifically, this research will (i) capture the self-assembly trajectories of representative anisotropic NPs using low-dose liquid-phase TEM with nanometer and millisecond resolution, (ii) extract from these trajectories hitherto physical parameters, such as NP-NP interaction potentials and self-assembly kinetic pathways, based on high-throughput statistical analysis of these trajectories, and (iii) quantify how diverse stimuli, such as temperature and solvent polarity, affect phase transition dynamics in systems of NPs with reconfigurable polymer coronas, moving towards systems that adapt their structure and functions entirely from the bottom-up. This approach will help establish a quantitative building block-nanoscale interaction-targeted structure relationship for predictive materials design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results are expected to aid in the design of phase domains on the surface of a vesicle such that specific proteins can anchor on the membrane to initiate subsequent biological reactions.

At the continuum level, the mathematical description of vesicle dynamics is a highly nonlinear, nonlocal moving boundary problem where the bilayer membrane serves as the moving boundary. The fundamental mathematical feature is that this system effectively couples surface phase dynamics, morphological evolution and compartment formation, and fluid motion so that the model describes a more realistic physical system than has been developed previously in the literature. The investigators develop and apply state-of-the-art adaptive numerical methods, perform analytical, numerical and modeling studies of important constituent processes, and work with experimentalists to test the model predictions and to help elucidate the underlying physical processes.

In physics, there remain open challenges to understanding how physical quantities like charge, heat, and even information evolve and undergo transport in systems of many interacting particles, especially when quantum effects are taken into account. Recently, new approaches to the study of transport in quantum systems have emerged based on the concepts of ""synthetic dimensions"" and ""synthetic lattices,"" in which our normal picture of transport in real space is abstracted to the transport of population in a space spanned by the internal states of small quantum systems such as individual atoms or molecules. For example, population can ""move"" between the electronic states of an atom (like hydrogen) through the absorption of light from an incident laser field.  In this way, a collection of atoms, which is well-understood and highly controllable with lasers or other electromagnetic fields, can be used to ""simulate"" a more complex condensed matter system, and lead to advances in our understanding of the complex system. The experimental effort in the current project will extend this type of approach to the study of transport to a new regime of strong inter-particle interactions. The team will conduct experiments based on samples of atoms that can be individually controlled and detected at the microscopic level. Microwave electromagnetic fields will be used to precisely control the transport of population between states of the atoms, allowing for new kinds of explorations into transport phenomena. Additionally, the team will lead an effort to broaden the scope and impact of undergraduate research opportunities, with a primary emphasis on increasing the participation of members from underrepresented groups. This effort will focus on building a new, undergraduate student-led research project on networks of mechanical oscillators that are coupled by ""synthetic,"" or engineered and indirect, forces. This effort will incorporate undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in cutting-edge research related to new kinds of transport phenomena, and will use these human-scale experiments to generate visualization video content that will be utilized for outreach and instruction.<br/><br/>This project builds on previous work designing synthetic lattices in neutral atoms and photons, extending these ideas to a new platform for the exploration of many-body transport phenomena based on the internal degrees of freedom of ultracold Rydberg atoms. By considering the problem of quantum transport taking place in an internal state space (driven by coherent microwave transitions and strong dipole-dipole interactions) rather than real space, this approach leverages the ability to manipulate internal degrees of freedom with spectroscopic control. This spectroscopic control allows for the precise engineering of synthetic lattices with nontrivial band topology, kinetic frustration, and tunable disorder. Resonant dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms will lead to new phenomena with relevance to the interplay of topology and strong interactions, to the study of relaxation and thermalization in isolated interacting disordered systems, and perhaps to the emergence of entirely new forms of many-body phenomena. The research team will explore the ability to engineer novel synthetic lattice models in the internal state space of Rydberg atoms, and will explore how resonant dipole-dipole interactions lead to new many-body phenomena in these synthetic lattices. An additional effort related to broadening the scope and impact of undergraduate research will lead a project to create topological lattice models based on synthetically-coupled oscillator networks. This research effort will enable new functionality of engineered mechanical networks, including new capabilities for designing non-reciprocity, artificial gauge fields, disorder, and strong nonlinearities.

These Metal-organic frameworks have unique properties when they react with light. The goal of this research is to make framework compositions with the ability to capture and specifically channel light for efficient light harvesting and conversion into stored chemical energy. The knowledge gained through this CAREER research will have a broad impact in southern Illinois by augmenting young student's (high school and below) perception towards basic science.

The project is interdisciplinary by design - the problems cut across the fields of materials science and fluid dynamics - and is motivated by both practical and futuristic engineering applications. In materials science, for instance, there is the potential for new biologically-inspired and growth-based design mechanisms for building highly flexible but controlled solid membranes. Regarding fluid dynamics, besides the potential for the design of new and extremely efficient heat exchangers, the investigation is motivated by the broader scientific challenge of deriving the scaling laws of naturally occurring transport in turbulent fluids. As experience shows, these questions are very difficult to solve on a computer by applying conventional numerical techniques. There are oftentimes many nearly optimal answers, and each can be rather complex. Rigorous mathematical analysis presents the possibility of knowing that certain patterns are truly optimal overall: such information cannot be gleaned using other non-rigorous approaches. Thus, the project is an important contribution to the larger scientific community interested in understanding why or how such complex patterns achieve global optimality.  <br/>  <br/>This project consists of two main parts: (a) The first class of problems concerns the mechanics of thin elastic sheets, such as naturally occurring ones like leaves and flowers, but also man-made versions which can be orders of magnitude thinner than a standard sheet of paper. The thinner an elastic sheet becomes the more easily it can be deformed, in particular through bending forces, but extracting from such intuitive physical principles the mathematical mechanisms behind the vast array of wrinkling, folding, and crumpling patterns found in experiments is a clear and difficult challenge. The investigator seeks to derive through rigorous mathematical analysis the effective, coarse-grained models governing optimal elastic patterns in the vanishing thickness limit. A key task is to obtain the scaling law of the minimum energy in any natural parameters, and then to ask which patterns can possibly attain such energy scaling laws. (b) The second class of problems regards the design of incompressible fluid flows for achieving optimal heat transfer. While hot objects submerged in fluid media do cool on their own, it is natural to ask whether the efficiency of heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by intelligent stirring of the surrounding fluid. Oftentimes, any stirring protocol achieves some enhancement of heat transfer, but determining which strategies attain maximal heat transfer overall is an intriguing and open question. In the advection-dominated limit, which can be reached by increasing the amount of power available with which to stir, such optimal strategies exhibit patterns remarkably similar to those from problems of ""energy-driven pattern formation"" in mathematical materials science. The investigator is developing a precise and general link between these apparently related classes of problems, and is exploring its ramifications for the study of the scaling laws of naturally occurring turbulent transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful.

Defects are deviations from the ideal expected structure of a material and include: missing atoms, the appearance of impurity atoms, and rearrangements of atoms. Most conventional three-dimensional semiconductor materials, such as those that make up the transistors in computers, rely on the intentional incorporation of defects to modify their properties to enable them to function as required for the application. For instance, photovoltaic solar cells rely on incorporation of defects to enable sunlight to electricity conversion as a renewable energy source. Thermoelectric materials rely on defect incorporation into semiconductors to convert heat to electricity, which is used to power satellites in space and may be useful for waste heat harvesting on earth. The properties of defects in semiconductors are closely linked to the behavior of electrons in the material, which is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop and apply predictive computational tools to understand how defects control the properties of emerging two-dimensional materials that are promising for applications. Single atomic-layer thick graphene with a honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms that resembles atomic-scale chicken wire provides one example.  In comparison to three-dimensional materials, the defect-property relationships in two-dimensional are not well understood. A unique coupling between material structure and electronic properties arises in 2D materials and leads to a distinct and rich defect physics that is different from 3D materials. The outcomes of this research will be the development of computational tools to establish these relationships, and an enhanced understanding of defect engineering in two-dimensional systems to help realize better performing devices in electronics, photonics, energy harvesting and storage, and other areas.  <br/><br/>The research effort will be integrated with educational and outreach activities to increase the diversity of the next generation technical workforce.

A critical barrier is that defects in 2D materials exhibit behavior from those in 3D materials, and currently they are not well understood. A unique coupling between topological structure and electronic structure arises in 2D materials and gives rise to a distinct and rich defect physics. The goal of this work is to exploit this unique coupling to enable unprecedented functionality through the purposeful addition of defects in a controlled way.<br/><br/>To merge aspects of topological structure and electronic structure in 2D materials, the PI will invoke approaches that span length scales from the atomic scale where a quantum mechanical description based on the interacting Schrodinger equation is required to micrometer-scale topological defect structures. Statistical mechanics frameworks that predict the defect topology of a 2D material that deforms in 3D will be directly linked with first-principles electronic structure methods to demonstrate that topology and chemical doping can be integrated in ways that enable new functionality. First-principles approaches will utilize both hybrid density functional theory and emerging, high-accuracy quantum Monte Carlo methods. Since quantitative first-principles descriptions of defects require extraordinarily high accuracy, potential limitations to the accuracy attainable will be assessed. The integrated approach will be used to answer several outstanding questions on defect physics in 2D systems.  These include: (a) How can topological structure and functionalization be integrated to design high-performance 2D thermoelectrics? (b) How can topological structure and chemical doping be integrated to design high-performance 2D photovoltaics? (c) Do 2D materials undergo defect-mediated ductile/brittle transitions as their 3D counterparts? (d) What is the nature of the defect-induced insulator to metal transitions in 2D materials? <br/><br/>The research effort will be integrated with educational and outreach activities to increase the diversity of the next generation technical workforce. Through the introduction of a new course entitled ""Community Outreach for Science and Engineering Researchers,"" the effort targets several key junctures of the student development pipeline from middle school to graduate students.  Graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in the course will be directly engaged in outreach activities to local schools.  They will design, test, revise, deploy, and disseminate active learning modules both to local middle schools in the Champaign-Urbana region and at weeklong residential summer camps for high school students held on the Illinois campus. The learning activities will be disseminated to the community through annual teacher training workshops and an online dedicated website. Software developed in the course of the research will be disseminated as open source to the broader community through GitHub."

Abnormalities in neurochemical communication are implicated in disorders and diseases of the nervous system, which include drug addiction, dementia, diabetes, cancer, and aging. Dr. Mei Shen of the University of Illinois creates new electrochemical methods and microscopes to detect, measure, and visualize the presence of chemicals that are used as neurotransmitters (neurochemicals) that currently cannot be investigated by other methods. These novel measurement tools enable new discoveries in chemical communications between nerve cells, which result from electrical and chemical signals.  The tools and techniques promise to provide an increased understanding of brain function. Professor Shen's program also promotes early-childhood education, and teaching and learning of both college and graduate students through an education project called NANO. Educational efforts with young children in the program help develop positive attitudes toward science and serve as an early intervention to reduce science achievement gaps that are present before kindergarten. The college-level educational activities serve local communities by generating fundamental knowledge to address societal health-care challenges and provide enriching opportunities for students in science. <br/><br/>With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Dr. Mei Shen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to develop new neuroanalysis platforms to enable better understanding of brain chemistry. Until now, it has been difficult to concurrently measure two different groups of monoamine and cholinergic neurotransmitters at the location where neurons communicate. This research program seeks to create chemically-sensitive, multimodal, electrochemical platforms that provide fast (microsecond), nanometer-resolution measurements of these two groups of neurotransmitters. This project is interdisciplinary, impacting the fields of electrochemistry, nanoscience, neuroscience, and brain chemistry. In education and outreach, ""Nanoelectrochemistry And Neuroscience Outreach (NANO)"" education projects are developed to teach nanoscience and brain chemistry to children from preschool age to grade 12 in public schools. The long term education goals include helping children develop positive attitudes toward science through science learning experiences in early childhood and addressing the science achievement gaps that are initially present during preschool and continue to occur as children age. Collaborations with the Child Development Laboratory of Illinois (CDL) and public schools provide opportunities for teaching brain chemistry to diverse groups of children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The quantum mechanical nature of atoms and electrons governs the behavior of materials at microscopic length- and time scales, but at large scales a fully atomistic approach is intractable. Computer simulations that bridge different length scales carry the promise of bringing fundamental research closer to manufacturing: New materials and technological applications could be developed faster and cheaper. That is particularly true for optical materials that are, for instance, needed for photovoltaic devices and energy production, displays, and novel efficient sensors for biological and medical applications.<br/><br/>In this project, the research team seeks to develop an approach for computational design and discovery of optical materials across multiple length scales. The researchers will improve approximations that are used to achieve a quantum mechanical description of optical absorption. This in turn will enable the team to successfully describe materials with strong interactions between electrons and ions, a subject of intense current interest. Based on the results of these predictive simulations, the team will abandon the atomistic resolution of the model in order to simulate optical materials that are structured at nanoscale dimensions. The team will incorporate data from recently developed public online databases into the computational framework aiming to discover new candidate materials and investigate their suitability for modern optical applications. The input and output research data sets will be made publicly available for advanced verification and validation, and possibly unforeseen uses, e.g. in data-mining.<br/><br/>While the broader availability of supercomputers transforms how modern research is done, skilled, interdisciplinary researchers are becoming an essential component. For that reason, the research project is tightly integrated with educational activities to train the next-generation workforce at the nexus of materials and computer science. The PI will incorporate computer simulations into the undergraduate curriculum at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and develop computational learning modules that can be directly used in the classroom.

The researchers will extend presently used first-principles quantum-mechanical techniques to overcome limitations that lead to large uncertainties for optical absorption spectra, and especially for excitonic effects in polar materials. They will achieve multiscale predictions for nanostructured materials by solving Maxwell equations, and they will develop approaches to screen online data repositories for excited-state properties. This framework will allow the design and discovery of novel optical materials, entirely based on computer simulations.<br/><br/>To achieve the goals of this project, the research team will develop detailed understanding of complicated electron-electron and electron-ion interactions based on parameter-free quantum-mechanical simulations. They will improve the description of dielectric screening by accounting for contributions from free carriers and the lattice, overcoming uncertainties for novel polar materials. Using these results in Maxwell-equation-based modeling of nanostructured materials eliminates the dependence on input from experiment, and extends the atomistic first-principles simulations into the nanoscale regime. The team will use existing data from large density-functional theory based online databases to learn about excited-state properties, and to facilitate the discovery of new optical materials within tens of thousands of available datasets.

Such ""big data"" problem challenges many statistical approaches and significantly increases the amount of computation in estimation and inference. In this project, the PI focuses on specific instances of large-scale experiments and develops a set of novel theories and methodologies on experimental design, sampling, and analysis. The research has two major parts. In Part 1, the PI focuses on the type of experiments that contains a large dimension of covariate variables. For example, in a clinical trial, the covariates can be patients' rich medical history. How should the treatment settings be assigned to each patient? The PI provides the answer through a general experimental design framework so that the treatment effects are estimated accurately despite the influence of the covariates. In Part 2, the PI focuses on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, one of the most popular statistical learning tools. The computation required is prohibitive for analyzing large-scale experiments such as the climate model simulations. The PI develops a dimension reduction framework and an active learning method that significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of the GP model.<br/><br/><br/>Three major methodologies are considered. In Parts 1-3, the PI introduces a new discrepancy-based design to achieve covariate balance for experiments with a large dimension of covariates. The discrepancy criterion also has appealing theoretical properties that lead to a more accurate estimation of the parameters including both treatment effects and covariates' effects. Optimal design algorithms are developed for both offline and online experiments. In Part 4, the PI develops a novel dimension reduction method that finds the optimal convex combination of low-dimension kernel functions for the GP model. It is shown that the proposed method is a significantly less computational and more accurate approximation of certain types of underlying functions. In  Part 5, an active learning method based on the generalized Cook's Distance is developed for the GP regression. It is more efficient than the standard random sampling method. The research is novel in ideas, rigorous in theories, and useful in practice, and will open new directions in the statistical design and analysis of experiments area. The PI has a detailed education plan to develop new course modules, tutorials, and workshops based on the research products from this project. The research outcomes are readily applicable to a variety of scientific, engineering, medicine and other fields where large-scale data collection and analysis are demanded.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, to realize these advances, one needs to understand how quantum systems interact with various environments.  This project will aid in the development of quantum technologies by adding to the theoretical approaches that can be used to plan optimum control of quantum systems. In particular, this project will investigate how to avoid errors in quantum computation that arise because of prior correlations between quantum systems and their environment.  This is important because understanding how quantum systems behave in various environments will lead to new knowledge in several fields ranging from biological systems, to materials science, fundamental physics, and molecular scale machines.  This work could thus enable better health care, better materials for use in industry as well as everyday life, and a variety of technologies that operate on the molecular scale.  This project will train students to use quantum physics techniques and to understand the physical concepts.  Outreach activities intended to reach a broader audience will also be undertaken as part of this project.<br/> <br/>In order to achieve reliable quantum information processing we must develop methods for controlling quantum systems.  This includes modeling quantum systems that are noisy due to interactions with their environment.  A standard method for describing the evolution of open quantum systems is to assume the environment and the system in question are initially decoupled, evolve under some joint evolution, and then average over the environmental degrees of freedom to obtain an effective noisy evolution.  This method of modeling the evolution is inadequate under some conditions such as strong coupling and quantum systems that are initially coupled to their environment.  The objective of this work is to aid in the development of quantum technologies by helping understand and describe requirements for practical modeling and error prevention strategies in these circumstances by understanding the limitations of previous work and finding ways to describe systems that do not satisfy the standard assumptions.

However, big knowledge gaps remain in the understanding of how these principles apply to other ions such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium; all of these ions are crucial components of exciting next-generation batteries. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program at NSF, introduces ultra-thin electrodes, which are composed of a few atom-thick flat layers of carbon, so-called few-layer graphene (FLG), as a platform for identifying problems during the storage of a broad range of ions. Because FLG is so thin, experiments can be performed very quickly. On this project researchers use techniques for seeing through FLG easily, and perform reliable quantum calculations mimicking their behavior. This allows them to swiftly evaluate ion storage performance and to learn fundamental principles impacting battery systems at large. This project aligns to NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing national prosperity by creating new knowledge on strategic materials for energy storage, such as batteries. This helps the USA to remain at the forefront of science.

This research will be integrated with broader impact activities aimed at changing the attitudes of K-12 students and the general public toward physics and science through activities that will be developed in the eXtreme Gravity Institute at Montana State University, a fertile training ground for the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>This project is aimed at (i) the development of analytic, ready-to-use models for the orbital dynamics and gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of generic compact binaries (black hole and neutron star binaries with arbitrary spin and eccentricity), and (ii) the use of these models to analyze and interpret current and future ground-based gravitational wave data to study astrophysics and experimental relativity implications. The gravitational wave models used currently are restricted to (at most nearly) quasi-circular inspirals with (typically) spins aligned/anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum (or to simple-precession-like approximations). Such models are sufficient for the detection and characterization of current GW observations, but as advanced LIGO is upgraded to reach design sensitivity and third-generation detectors are constructed, more accurate models will be needed. Not only will these models prevent the biasing of parameter estimation due to mis-modeling systematics, but the additional information they encode will allow for more accurate parameter estimation and the extraction of new information from the data. This new information, such as the orbital eccentricity and the spin vector components, can inform astrophysical population models, as well as allow for new tests of General Relativity in the mostly-unexplored, extreme gravity regime. The proposed research includes the implementation of the ready-to-use models in data analysis studies to determine the astrophysics and experimental-relativity information that can be extracted from current and future gravitational wave data. This research will be integrated with broader impact activities aimed at changing the attitudes of K-12 students and the general public toward physics and science. ""The Art of Physics"" activity is an art competition and residency program in the Department of Physics at MSU, in which undergraduate students will be educated in cutting-edge physics and create art works that convey its concepts. The art pieces will compete at a juried exhibition, with the winning artist becoming the resident artist in physics for the next year. The ""Learn to Fail"" activity is an art installation in which Montana State University faculty will share their failure stories with the MSU student population and general public on camera while contrasting their biggest achievements. Through this juxtaposition between failures and successes, the installation will generate an honest dialogue about the role and meaning of failure in academia. ""eXtreme Gravity for Middle School? are fully-formed, standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers aimed at supporting them in learning how to deliver content on topics including gravitational lensing, neutron stars, black holes and gravitational waves to middle school students. Other activities include a black-hole themed bout for the local roller derby team, public talks given by the PI, and continued STEM mentoring for middle-school students from local schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, their resistance to radiation damage is insufficient. We investigate here one approach to increase materials radiation resistance, where small additions of carefully selected alloying elements are used to drastically slow down the kinetics of evolution of these materials. The approach takes advantage of the large body of accurate data now available to the community from high-throughput atomistic calculations to screen the most promising alloying elements. The research proposes to employ state-of-the-art nanoscale experiments to validate this approach in a copper matrix, for which antimony has been pre-selected as a promising alloying element. The work also aims at determining whether this material design approach can be combined with another one, relying on the spontaneous formation of precipitates at the nanoscale, thus resulting in extreme radiation resistance. The research will provide education for two graduate students and several undergraduate students, with an emphasis on advanced materials synthesis and characterization techniques, and atomistic modeling. Special effort will be made to recruit female and underrepresented minority students. The research will be integrated with education to further develop and implement active learning techniques.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/><br/>This fundamental research program examines a strategy for designing single phase materials resistant to radiation damage by using small alloying additions of solutes that trap point defects so as to increase point defect mutual recombination over their elimination at sinks. While this strategy has been considered in the past, and yielded encouraging results, it has not received widespread attention in large part because no reliable method was available to select the best solutes to trap point defect. The proposed research takes advantage of recent modeling advances to overcome these limitations. Specifically, for a Cu matrix, using first principles calculations to calculate solute-point defect interactions, and self-consistent mean-field theory to calculate defect and solute transport coefficients, Sb was identified as one of these promising solutes. The experimental program measures directly the relative rate of recombination over sink elimination during irradiation of dilute Cu-Sb alloys from the broadening and the drift of thin marker layers placed at strategic positions in a Cu thin film bounded by Nb layers, the Cu/Nb interfaces providing near perfect sinks for point defect elimination. These broadenings and shifts are measured at the nanoscale using atom probe tomography (APT) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition this approach is implemented for imparting radiation resistance to alloys that self-organizes under irradiation, such as Cu-Fe, so as to further extend their stability under irradiation. By combining the two approaches, point defect trapping and compositional patterning, radiation resistance can be achieved in a vastly extended domain of irradiation conditions. The experimental program is complemented by atomistic KMC simulations to support the data analysis and to explore the potential impact of simplifications made during the solute screening stage. The impact of the program is broadened by offering research opportunities to undergraduates and by integrating research with education through computational modules in courses taught by the PIs. Active engagement is also offered to develop, assess, and spread active learning techniques."

With the abundance of available observations, traditional statistical methods under the parametric assumption that a model can be characterized by a pre-specified number of parameters become inadequate and less attractive. Bayesian nonparametric models are attractive in this context which allow the resolution level of the analysis to be determined in a data-driven manner, and provide automatic characterization of uncertainty. The goal of this project is to develop new theory, methodology and computational tools for Bayesian nonparametric inference via Gaussian process priors. <br/><br/>Given the availability of massive data, nonparametric inference offers an attractive framework for flexibly modeling the underlying structure and extracting useful information. For instance, such challenges occur in chemical physics, computational biology, computer vision, engineering, and meteorology. This project aims to lay down a solid methodological, algorithmic, and theoretical foundation for nonparametric inference based on Gaussian processes. In particular, Gaussian process-based approaches tend to be vulnerable to data contamination and have heavy computational costs. To alleviate the high-computational cost of Gaussian process inference procedures, the investigator puts forward two novel computational frameworks which differ at their respective approximating targets as being either the prior or the posterior. To enhance the robustness of Gaussian process inference against data contamination, the investigator proposes a novel class of Bayesian hierarchical models for incorporating this extra measurement error structure, leading to a class of robust Gaussian process inference procedures. The new theoretical development offers valuable insight to experiment-design practitioners into the impact of measurement errors upon prediction and estimation, and provides evidence on the deep connection between computational complexity and statistical learnability. These computational and theoretical frameworks also benefit other disciplines such as applied mathematics, computer science and finance where stochastic processes such as Gaussian processes are routinely used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, dark matter is known to exist from astronomical observations; however, the particle properties of dark matter remain shrouded in mystery.

One of the great mysteries of our world is how myriad forms of life grow and develop from a single cell into a new organism.  The sequence of developmental events is surprisingly robust, even though the biological processes emerge from a complex interplay between genetic programming and environmental inputs that can be quite variable.  The revolution in ""omics"" and high-throughput analysis has uncovered associations in this process, but the causal mechanisms remain unknown.  The research at the Center seeks to understand the underlying biological mechanisms and principles associated with these remarkable phenomena.  The Center focuses on four interrelated research areas selected to elucidate distinct aspects of growth and development.  Each project integrates hypothesis-driven mathematical modeling and data-driven mathematical analysis with advanced imaging, genomics, and metabolomics tools to explore biological processes across time, space, and extrinsic variables.  Graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral trainees will be embedded in shared mathematical and biological environments, engaged in work with investigators across this multi-disciplinary spectrum.  The Center will build interdisciplinary capacity through a visiting scholars program, a named fellows program, a pilot project program, a middle-school science club learning module, workshops, and training courses.  It will advance knowledge in the biological and mathematical sciences, generate new conceptual models explaining development and growth, and train new investigators who are experienced in both fields.<br/><br/>The NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology aims to transform understanding of organismal growth and development through quantitative approaches that combine three fundamental mathematical areas: dynamical systems theory, stochastic processes, and dimension reduction.  The Center also intends to make substantial technical advances in quantitative approaches, by producing new high-dimensional biological datasets across spatial (cellular to organismal) and temporal scales, new conceptual models of diverse developmental processes, and mathematical models that describe developmental emergence.  Project 1 will produce single-cell RNA-sequence data from a frog embryo and mouse embryonic stem cells at various stages during development and new conceptual models of embryogenesis using dynamical systems theory and statistical dimension reduction.  The high-dimensional approach and datasets from Project 2 will enable a new mathematical model of roundworm growth as a function of genotype and environmental variables.

Qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computation, are the quantum analogs of the binary states of classical computers. A fundamental requirement of qubits is that the time over which they retain the encoded information, known as lifetime, is long compared to the operations that manipulate them.  Here, the research team proposes a method to dramatically increase qubit lifetimes in specialized two-dimensional semiconductor materials. The main mechanism by which information in a qubit is lost is through interactions of the system and its environment, much like a pendulum is slowed down by friction at its suspension point.  A common approach to increasing qubit lifetime is to isolate the system, analogous to lubricating the point of suspension of the pendulum, but this is highly impractical for many quantum information applications. The approach proposed here is to periodically decouple the system from its environment using various external controls. In this way, qubit lifetime is extended even at room temperature, greatly expanding the range of materials that can be used for quantum information applications. These research aims are naturally integrated with an educational plan that seeks to advance undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training. The mechanism of this program is the development of online tutorial courses and outreach work that promotes science learning to a broad audience.<br/><br/>Technical description: A major challenge in quantum information sciences has been the prevalence of short-lived coherences between quantum states, which impede practical utilization of quantum phenomena. This is especially problematic at room temperature where the environment causes large energy fluctuations that greatly accelerate decoherence.  Here, the research team proposes a method to dramatically increase electronic coherence times in quantum-confined two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors at room temperature.  The approach is multi-faceted: 1) perform 'single' particle measurements to minimize heterogeneous broadening, 2) identify transient excitonic states that are well-below the bandgap of the materials, and 3) create unique decoherence-free subspaces by optical driving fields that decouple the excitons from strongly coupled phonons, thereby giving rise to long-lived coherences among electronic states of matter. The proposed platform based on highly tunable 2D organic-inorganic perovskite crystals is used to create robust quantum states far from thermal equilibrium for applications in quantum sensing, quantum transport, and quantum information processing. 2D perovskites are ideal materials for this purpose because they exhibit a large manifold of transient and strongly-coupled exciton states that can be used as qubits in quantum information processing and sensing.  The approach combines ideas from magnetic resonance, quantum chemistry, coherent spectroscopy, and quantum optics in order to create long-lived coherences with orders-of-magnitude longer electronic coherence times than currently possible in condensed-phase molecular systems under ambient conditions. The work proposed here enables understanding of how structural and chemical changes to the system, as well as modifications of the bath through external perturbations, affect decoherence far from thermal equilibrium. This project incorporates an educational component that advances undergraduate and graduate training through the creation of online tutorial courses that disseminate the research findings and the scientific background necessary to understand them. These courses are made available to a wide audience of students and teachers at the K-12 levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A research collaboration between the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago will investigate whether careful measurement of the properties of GW events, when combined with traditional astronomical observations can help astronomers to better determine the Hubble constant, H0, which is related to the age and expansion rate of the universe.  This research will be integrated with activities aimed at changing the attitudes of middle-school students and the general public toward physics and science, through a newly-developed planetarium show and accompanying standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers, along with public talks by the lead scientists. <br/> <br/>The research is aimed at studying whether the use of more sophisticated models for the GWs emitted in the coalescence of neutron stars can be used to better measure the Hubble constant.  The GW waveform models used today depend on the tidal Love numbers of each star in the binary, dimensionless parameters that measure the rigidity of a body in response to tides.  It is known that these constants are related to each other and to the mass ratio of the binary through certain equation-of-state insensitive relations. The use of the latter allows for the extraction of the individual tidal parameters, which can then be used to extract the source masses of the binary components. The waveform, on the other hand, also depends on the redshifted chirp mass of the binary, which can be extracted as an independent parameter. Therefore, the combination of the measurement of the individual source masses through the tidal parameters and the measurement of the redshifted chirp mass should yield a measurement of the redshift, independently from any electromagnetic counterpart. The research will study how well the redshift can be measured through this technique, and whether the accuracy to which H0 can be estimated may be improved by combining this redshift measurement with information from an electromagnetic counterpart or through the stacking of information from multiple GW events.  The principal investigator of the project has developed a planetarium show called Einstein?s Gravity Playlist, which is designed to explain general relativity, black holes, and gravitational waves to young audiences. This show will be deployed in the Midwest, starting at the Staerkel Planetarium in Champaign, Illinois, and later at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The show will be paired with ""eXtreme Gravity for Middle School,"" a set of fully formed, standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers aimed at supporting them in learning how to deliver content on topics including gravitational lensing, neutron stars, black holes and gravitational waves to middle school students.

Professor Punit Kohli from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and colleagues Saikat Talapatra, Kyle Plunkett, Farhan Chowdhury and Senetta Bancroft are acquiring a multimode atomic force microscope (AFM). The microscope is a powerful tool for studying the surface of various materials.  It uses an atomic scale probe in which the pointed tip scans across a surface and measures the force between the probe and the surface.  This produces a high-resolution image of the surface with information on its structure and properties.  It leads to a basic understanding of complicated phenomenon that are in play at the atomic level.  Such knowledge is needed for understanding key physical properties of nanoscale materials and systems. An example of its use is in the synthesis of materials effective for treating contaminated water by photo catalytic methods to destroy organic contaminants such as dioxane or polyfluoroalkyl substances.  The instrument is employed by students in their research. It is used in classroom and laboratory instruction.  Therefore, the availability of this instrument significantly augments the learning experience of the students, faculty and staff not only at the SIUC campus but also beyond at other colleges and universities in the rural Southern Illinois region. <br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  The AFM is used to investigate the  mechanical properties at the nanoscale of organic, inorganic, and biological materials.  The fabrication and assembly of three dimensional (3D) architectural devices for electronics  and neuron circuits is being studied.  Strategic innovations in nanomaterials synthesis and design are under investigation for improving opto-electronics devices for energy storage and catalysis.  Materials for contaminant sequestration and bioremediation to improve water quality are also targeted. Another application addresses engineering a microenvironment for homogeneous epiblast stem cell renewal. The results have implications in multiple fields including cell mechanics, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A research collaboration between the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago will investigate whether careful measurement of the properties of GW events, when combined with traditional astronomical observations can help astronomers to better determine the Hubble constant, H0, which is related to the age and expansion rate of the universe.  This research will be integrated with activities aimed at changing the attitudes of middle-school students and the general public toward physics and science, through a newly-developed planetarium show and accompanying standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers, along with public talks by the lead scientists. <br/> <br/>The research is aimed at studying whether the use of more sophisticated models for the GWs emitted in the coalescence of neutron stars can be used to better measure the Hubble constant.  The GW waveform models used today depend on the tidal Love numbers of each star in the binary, dimensionless parameters that measure the rigidity of a body in response to tides.  It is known that these constants are related to each other and to the mass ratio of the binary through certain equation-of-state insensitive relations. The use of the latter allows for the extraction of the individual tidal parameters, which can then be used to extract the source masses of the binary components. The waveform, on the other hand, also depends on the redshifted chirp mass of the binary, which can be extracted as an independent parameter. Therefore, the combination of the measurement of the individual source masses through the tidal parameters and the measurement of the redshifted chirp mass should yield a measurement of the redshift, independently from any electromagnetic counterpart. The research will study how well the redshift can be measured through this technique, and whether the accuracy to which H0 can be estimated may be improved by combining this redshift measurement with information from an electromagnetic counterpart or through the stacking of information from multiple GW events.  The principal investigator of the project has developed a planetarium show called Einstein?s Gravity Playlist, which is designed to explain general relativity, black holes, and gravitational waves to young audiences. This show will be deployed in the Midwest, starting at the Staerkel Planetarium in Champaign, Illinois, and later at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The show will be paired with ""eXtreme Gravity for Middle School,"" a set of fully formed, standards-aligned lesson plans for middle school teachers aimed at supporting them in learning how to deliver content on topics including gravitational lensing, neutron stars, black holes and gravitational waves to middle school students.

In crystalline metals, which means practically all technical alloys, these defects are called dislocations. Acting cooperatively, many dislocations can begin to move at the same time. This process can lead to abrupt plastic instabilities that deteriorate the structural stability of components and eventually trigger failure. One main problem with such collective, avalanche-like, processes is that they occur spontaneously, which means that they are hard to predict. In addition, these dislocation avalanches are confined to the nanometer scale and proceed extremely fast. As a result, very little is known about how they proceed in space and time. In this research effort, the PI and his students will unravel the precise dynamics of dislocation avalanches. We will not only track their spatiotemporal dynamics, but we will also define how they respond to changes in temperature. This will be done by unique micro-scale and temperature-dependent deformation experiments with extremely fast response dynamics. General statistical and physical models that are predicted to describe the avalanche behavior will be tested with the experimental data, and novel deformation models will be proposed. A successful completion of our research will lead to a better control of structural stability, and drive the development of mathematical models that can predict avalanches and therefore failure. Since avalanches occur in many other systems, such as earthquakes, disordered materials, or magnetism, the significance of the here-obtained results will extend well beyond plasticity of metals. In order to increase the nation's diversity and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM education, the PI will develop an educational program in the area of solid materials for the middle-school age-bracket, which he will present in outreach activities at schools, and also pioneer a new middle-school camp for girls. These interventions will be integrated with active learning techniques that the PI is currently implementing in undergraduate education.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This proposal will tackle a notoriously difficult problem that controls the structural integrity of metallic materials: How do local structural instabilities proceed in the space-time-temperature domain? These instabilities are caused by collective defect dynamics, called dislocation avalanches in crystals. The challenge lies in the spatial confinement and the short time scales of such processes. Using nanoseconds time resolution in combination with sub-nanometer displacement resolution during a temperature-dependent micro-scale straining experiment, the objective will be to trace dislocation avalanches in real time. This will be achieved by extending a commercially available nanoindenter with MHz data sampling capabilities, and to integrate the system into a cryostat. Four main thrusts compose the core of this research program: 1) non-linear modeling of the device-sample dynamics, 2) experimental validation of theoretically predicted scaling laws, 3) unraveling the transition from intermittent to smooth plastic flow, and 4) determining thermal activation parameters for dislocation avalanche dynamics. If successful, the hereby generated large experimental data set will be a unique basis for the development of predictive materials modeling, and may lead to a better control of the depinning transition and thus the strength of structural materials. Key of this project will be a unified experimental approach with highly time-resolved and temperature-dependent small-scale deformation experiments that can assess the velocity-profiles of dislocation avalanches, thereby scrutinizing recently proposed theories for avalanches near the depinning transition. The impact of these efforts is a first real-time assessment of a dynamic phase in crystal plasticity, which will improve our physical understanding of a process that ultimately dictates the mechanical stability of metals, or forming of small metallic components. The results will be relevant for bulk metals in general, and provide numerous important parameters for materials modeling and systems that undergo similar dynamic phase transitions, ranging from crystals to granular materials. Unravelling avalanche characteristics will furthermore provide a coarse-grained view on dislocation plasticity that can bridge between dislocation dynamics and constitutive crystal plasticity modeling, which may directly lead to more efficient multi-scale modeling frameworks."

Remarkably, particle physics theories proposed for other reasons predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituents of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Over the past three years, the SuperCDMS collaboration has led the field in the search for low-mass dark matter.  The most recent results from CDMSlite reached an energy threshold for electron recoils as low as 56 eV. These results excluded new parameter space for the dark matter-nucleon spin-independent cross section for dark matter masses between 1.6 and 5.5 GeV/c2.  This project will focus on better understanding the response of the signal detectors in a push to make the SuperCDMS yet more sensitive.<br/><br/>The SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment will have a broad impact which extends beyond the search for dark matter. The experiment's phonon-mediated detectors have applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry. This effort will contribute opportunities for training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. SuperCDMS will engage in education and outreach at local institutions and will coordinate outreach at SNOLAB and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota to increase the broader impact with a focus on secondary education. This award will support participating in SNOLAB-hosted teacher workshops, modifying and providing middle school dark matter education modules to U.S. educators, and maintaining SuperCDMS-related outreach materials for SNOLAB in Canada and SURF. Existing alliances will enable out-reach to Sudbury First Nations communities. This effort will also support post-graduate education and outreach to underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>In order to maximize the science output of SuperCDMS SNOLAB, detailed understanding of the response of detectors to potential signals and backgrounds is required.

Resulting data will allow energy scale calibration, measurements of background levels, understanding of the detailed phonon and electron physics of the detectors, development of improved background-rejection techniques, validation and tuning of Detector Monte Carlo, and optimization of SuperCDMS SNOLAB operational parameters. These data should also provide a dark matter search with world-leading sensitivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This flexibility is important for the role it plays in other areas in being able to deal with somewhat noisy or imprecise data, and reason rigorously about it.  For many purposes, however, one wants to know how large or complex topological constructions are, and how stable solutions are to perturbations.  This requires, technically, that one studies not just nonlinear functions from one space to another, but also spaces that bound measurements (such as the size of derivatives) on the functions.  This mixed analytic topological study will be at the core of the project, with applications to geometric complexity, to spaces with singularities, which benefit from such study, but also require additional geometric and algebraic tools. Application to problems of numerical computation with natural resource bounds is anticipated<br/><br/>In more detail, this project will study the complexity measured in terms of Lipschitz constants and bi-Lipschitz constants of homotopies, embeddings, immersions and (volumes for) cobordisms in smooth and PL settings.  In some sense this should have the same relation to usual geometric topology as theoretical computer science has to logic. Indeed, using undecidability results, one can prove lower complexity bounds (as in Nabutovsky's ICM talk), but much homotopy theory, especially stable homotopy theory are decidable, but not effectively so (following Brown). The new information can be thought of as providing geometric information about function spaces of Lipschitz maps, showing that they have some bounds on diameter that are quite striking in comparison to the much larger estimates (that underly approximation theory, and some learning theory) for their volumes (also known as entropy, or covering numbers).  Besides the intrinsic interest in these questions, they also bear on variational problems and perhaps on computation (as in, for example, the Blum-Shub-Smale model).  Earlier variants of these quantitative concerns have already arisen in the study of square integrable cohomology and controlled (and bounded) topology.  These theories will continue to be studied, hopefully revealing more subtle refinements of the Borel/Baum-Connes conjectures in special cases (such as virtually solvable groups) and applications to understanding group actions on aspherical manifolds.  Interestingly, although there is currently no known quantitative bound at all on the number of embeddings of one manifold in another in codimension at least three, finiteness is known (for any Bi-Lipschitz bound), there is a natural strategy combining controlled topology with new information about function spaces to give, conjecturally, sharp estimates for these finite numbers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang?  Will the universe end in a Big Crunch?  Is there really a multiverse of possibilities?  In order to answer such basic questions about the nature of space and time, we need a quantum theory of gravity.  String theory is our best candidate for such a theory.  In his research, Professor Sethi aims to explore structure and symmetry in both string theory and the kinds of so-called ""quantum field theories"" of interest to particle physicists and condensed-matter physicists.  This research program is therefore in the national interest by advancing the development of the infrastructure of basic science in the United States.   This research program also has concomitant broader impacts in three areas.  The first comes from providing research opportunities for undergraduates, including continued participation in the Summer REU Opportunities for Minorities and Women program at the University of Chicago.  The second is through continued participation in both the Space Explorers inner-city K-12 enrichment program and the Life-Long Learning (L3) program.  The final aspect involves improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, through direct collaboration, and through the organization of relevant scientific meetings.<br/><br/>More technically, the goals of Professor Sethi's research center around two broad themes.  The ""structure"" aspect of this research involves exploring landscapes in field theory and string theory.  This will involve a number of topics, among them the description of flux backgrounds from a field-theory perspective and their realization in string theory via a novel landscape of anti-de Sitter space solutions;  the development of flux vacua in M-theory and type IIA string theory;  the role of anti-branes in flux vacua;  the exploration of constraints on inflating and de Sitter constructions in string theory;  the construction of accelerating space-times using stringy domain-wall solutions;  and the study of chiral gauge theory in two dimensions and its relation to new geometric structures.    By contrast, the ""symmetry"" aspect of the proposal involves exploring the implications of spontaneously broken symmetries in gravity and in effective field theory.  The questions in gravity revolve around the extent to which the dynamics of gravitational lumps is determined by symmetry.  In a broader context, anomalous and non-anomalous global symmetries can constrain effective field theory couplings with implications for condensed-matter systems such as quantum Hall systems.  The final set of questions involve supersymmetry in two ways:  first to develop a symbolic computation package that can generate supersymmetric Lagrangians with higher-derivative couplings (a long-needed tool that will have a host of applications in both string theory and field theory), and second to explore surprising simplifications in the vacuum structure of supersymmetric quantum-mechanics models."

Professor Mohr is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  His research program is combined with the development of new educational tools that can be used to explain complex concepts to science learners.  On the research front, Professor Mohr and his students seek to control the behavior of highly reactive molecules that contain either an unpaired electron or an anion. These ""intermediates"" are formed and then converted into the production of target molecules where the specific spatial arrangement of the atoms required is difficult to obtain using currently available methods. This project contributes to the fields of organic synthesis, organometallic chemistry, and physical organic chemistry and builds new molecules with potential long-range applications in medicine, agriculture, biochemistry, and materials science. On the educational front, Professor Mohr is working to educate young students through outreach activities that involve children in grades K-12 students, and to increase laboratory research opportunities for underrepresented students. Within this overall effort is a plan to introduce the concept of catalysis to middle school students. Catalysts are molecules that help reactions proceed faster toward desirable targets while not being consumed. By helping students to understand how catalysts react, Professor Mohr is able to teach the students many of the key concepts that form the foundation of modern chemical methods. Professor Mohr's education plan also includes an effort to identify college age organic chemistry students that are prone to have difficulty with spatial recognition tasks. Such difficulties can impede their education, so his plan is to identify the problem early so that extra help can be provided to the students in a timely fashion so as to ensure their long-term success. <br/><br/>First-row transition metals are attractive catalysts for generating reactive organic radical intermediates.  These radical species are particularly suited to novel regio- and stereoselective coupling reactions with conjugated alkenes.  This research seeks to develop new variants of such transformations that have specific uses in the synthesis of complex molecules applicable to the synthesis of natural products, functional materials, agrochemicals, and biochemical probes. This approach explores control of site-selectivity in reactions of conjugated dienolates.  The research uses insights into the electronic structure of these anionic intermediates to overcome the typical selectivity in the location of bond formation with ambident nucleophiles.  Use of this concept to synthesize organofluorine compounds reveals an unprecedented stereocontrol element with the potential to generate valuable, stereochemically rich organofluorine compounds.  The research also seeks to understand the fundamental chemical concepts that explain this novel stereocontrol effect.  The educational plan makes use of chemical reactivity as a platform to introduce the concept of metal catalysis to middle school students through a tangible demonstration.  A second portion of the educational plan seeks to identify students at risk for difficulty in learning stereochemical concepts and to provide early interventions that improve educational outcomes.  These components address scientific development at multiple levels."

A different strategy for a future generation of electronic devices is based on materials that exist in multiple electronic states. A new generation of electronic materials are required for this purpose, as are the means for switching between multiple electronic states. The fundamental science that is the focus of this project is centered on the sudden change in the electrical properties of certain materials when they are switched through a so-called metal-to-insulator transition by an external trigger. On one side of the transition, the material behaves like copper metal, while on the other side, it behaves like insulating wood. The project goal is to design and discover materials exhibiting such metal-to-insulator transitions that enable room-temperature operation and that display large changes in the key property of interest; the electrical resistivity. The strategy is to control properties by structural design at the atomic scale. The approach employs a tightly integrated combination of experiment, theory, and data-mining of the literature, that would enable new insights to emerge and aid in the design of desirable materials. This project will deliver a research workflow with a suite of tools to enable assessment and experimental validation of new concepts for the discovery of key materials. The project will articulate protocols for selecting high-performing materials, leading to an expanded palette of compounds that could impact future technologies. The teaching and training of students and the discovery capabilities of the project are interwoven, and aimed at broadening participation through the involvement of the investigators and their group members in public outreach events. The development of modules for undergraduate and graduate courses and the involvement of students in interdisciplinary team environments are intrinsic to project plan.

At the present time, the essential data and structure-electronic function relationships to decipher the genetic code (generic descriptors) of metal-to-insulator transitions do not exist in a format which permits predictive synthesis. The project?s significance is that it recasts the problem into one of atomic structure, focusing on the role of different kinds of structural distortions, notably, breathing modes, Jahn-Teller distortions, and Peierls-like instabilities across a broad range of structure types and chemistries. The project will generate and collect a range of data that will permit the mapping of electronic interactions into atomic features, applying informatics-based methods to enable supervised and unsupervised learning. The project will articulate predictive rules and protocols for selecting high-performing materials, leading to an expanded palette of compounds that could impact technologies beyond electronics. The teaching and training of students at multiple levels and the discovery capabilities of the project are interwoven and aimed at broadening participation by through public outreach events, through the development of modules for undergraduate and graduate courses; and finally, by involving students in interdisciplinary team environments. The project will yield a plethora of new data on a range of oxides and new computational materials approaches. These will be aggregated into databases on public web-portals using a new portable file format designed for materials data. New methods of data visualization will allow external users to interact, query, and analyze the data for aims beyond those proposed herein. Data-driven models and informatics workflows for generating quantitative models for metal-to-insulator performance will be hosted with the aforementioned data and visualization tools on the MIST: Metals and Insulators by Structural Tuning platform. The PIs also plan to release MIST as open source and build a user community around the platform by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the MIST codebase. This will allow a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award. Advances in synthesis, theory, and characterization will strengthen the scientific capabilities and workforce by allowing students and academic or industrial researchers to employ the formulated structure-property relationships for educational and research purposes."

Carbon-carbon bonds are an essential part of almost all organic chemicals. These important bonds form the backbone of most medicines and plastics (polymers) and thus are produced on massive scales.  Dr. Dong?s research focuses on forming carbon-carbon bonds from simple, inexpensive and non-toxic stating materials without also producing by-products which must be separated and/or discarded. This approach follows the principles of ?Green Chemistry? in that the new synthetic routes to commodity and specialty chemicals are more environmentally friendly. The research grant also supports the education of students at many levels.  Professor Dong is actively engaged in the ""ChiS&E"" program to provide early chemistry education to Chicago public middle-school students.  He is also involved in the Collegiate Scholars Program to teach high school students and the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) to offer laboratory research experiences to undergraduate students. These outreach activities encourage a diverse group students to explore careers in science and engineering while learning and actively contributing to research.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop byproduct-free ketone-olefin coupling reactions via transition metal (TM)-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond activation.  These approaches could serve as more environmentally-friendly approaches to access alkylated ketones. The research plan employs bifunctional templates to enable enamine/TM or imine/TM cooperative catalysis. The team's objectives are first, to develop a direct branched-selective alpha-alkylation of ketones with simple olefins via enamine/TM cooperative catalysis and second, to develop a direct alkylation of ketones with simple olefins via imine/TM cooperative catalysis. Carbonyl functionalization plays a central role in organic synthesis. Enolate alkylation and conjugate (alkyl) addition represent two common and important approaches for introducing alkyl groups at carbonyl positions.. Notably, these reactions are not economically- or environmentally-friendly processes mainly due to the use of stoichiometric halogen-based alkylating agents and/or stoichiometric organometallic species. Here, Professor Dong and his team employ a TM-catalyzed enamine or imine-mediated C-H functionalization strategy to achieve ketone alkylation using simple unactivated olefins as the alkylating agents. This approach is considered more sustainable than current methods because stoichiometric by-products are not generated and the reaction conditions are generally pH- and redox-neutral, thereby tolerating a broad range of functional groups.  From a practical viewpoint, olefins are typically a cheaper and more readily available feedstock than the corresponding alkyl halides or organometallic species. Byproduct-free ketone alkylation methods using regular olefins as the alkylating agents are developed through the new bifunctional catalysts. Professor Dong and his team are engaged in several outreach activities, including introducing grade school students to chemical concepts.  Integrating educational activities of students from diverse age groups and backgrounds into the existing research program has been a primary goal of the research group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, chemical treatments are used to alter the surface characteristics of semiconductors, and a continuous flow of electrical currents is used to change the surface characteristics of metals. In contrast, the surface characteristics of graphene, a material which consists of a single atomic layer of hexagonally bonded carbon atoms, can be dynamically tuned while preserving the superb properties of graphene. This is due to the atomically-thin nature and unique properties of graphene. This project studies tunable surface characteristics of graphene to enable a novel and multi-functional coating material. The capacity to dynamically tune the surface characteristics of graphene can be used to advance corrosion and oxidation resistant coating, sensing, condensation heat transfer, battery and supercapacitator efficiency, and microfluidics. These improvements increase productivity and reduce costs in the energy, manufacturing, and health sectors. In addition, the new knowledge and broader implications realized in this project offer an excellent educational opportunity to enhance community engagement and outreach in the exciting and growing field of nanotechnology. Specific avenues for dissemination include online learning platforms, summer research experiences for students, and field trips and summer science camps for high-school students.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Graphene, which consists of fully saturated and chemically inert sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, senses and interacts with external molecules in close vicinity via delocalized pi electrons. Unlike conventional bulk materials, external molecules can modulate the doping levels of graphene by interacting with these delocalized, massless Dirac fermions. Likewise, the modulation of doping levels can in turn affect the way graphene reacts with external molecules. The objective of this project is to establish a fundamental understanding of electrical doping-induced tunable surface energy and reactivity of graphene to address the knowledge gap concerning the coupling between graphene's electronic states and its surface energy/reactivity. The principal investigators' hypothesis is that the modulation of graphene's electron state by doping contributes to the tunable electrostatic force which graphene exerts on external molecules, and in turn impacts the tunable surface energy and reactivity of graphene. The research combines in situ experimental investigations with quantum and atomistic theoretical modeling. In situ microscopy, such as atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy, as well as spectroscopic characterizations, including Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, are performed to experimentally investigate how doping influences the surface energy and reactivity of graphene. Furthermore, theoretical investigations, including detailed quantum, atomistic and reactive molecular dynamics calculations, are performed to complement and explain experimental finding of doping-induced surface energy/reactivity, while the experimentally obtained parameters are used to develop a comprehensive theory for the prediction and development of new surface phenomena. This project advances the scientific knowledge of how modulation of doping levels affect graphene's reaction to external molecules as well as improves the technical capability of tunable surface characteristics of graphene."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). One of the promising techniques to look for BSM physics is to make precision measurements using standard particles like electrons and muons. One technique, in particular, is to make very precise measurements of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of electrons or muons. To do the next generation of EDM measurements will require advances in accelerator techniques and this award will  focus on those advancements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Direct EDM searches using all-electric storage rings, with measurements of stored electrons, protons, or radioactive nuclei are being considered. Historically only a very small number of all-electric rings have been constructed and none at the scale envisioned for these dedicated EDM measurements. Thus, the research enabled here will provide essential insights into the feasibility of using larger-scale high-gradient electric field devices for these important measurements. The success of the EDM experimental procedure is strongly connected to the ability to create a suitably robust storage ring that can perform the desired functions necessary for successful spin precession measurements of intense beams at the accuracies required. Through this award, studies will be performed in pursuit of storage ring arrangements and parameter sets suitable for use in EDM measurements. For verification of results, comparisons will be made, where applicable, to beam conditions being created for a present-day EDM measurement of the muon system. This award will provide students of accelerator science the opportunity to engage with expert members of the field to acquire first-hand experience in the design and specification process for relevant storage ring systems for future EDM experiments, yielding a more experienced workforce upon exit from the university program.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Accelerator science will lead the way to future accelerators for virtually every branch of science and for a broad spectrum of applications to meet national needs, and collaboration between national laboratories and research universities is a natural approach to attract, train and educate a new generation of accelerator scientists and engineers. The learning curve for scientists to cross into the applied field of accelerator science is often long, and hence acquiring practical skill and knowledge as graduate students will provide a highly desired early-experience for future members of the much-needed workforce. The training and experiences enabled through this award will ultimately reach into many areas of research as the workforce expands into other technical disciplines."

Peptides are typically small biomolecules discovered as fragments of proteins or coming from natural sources such as hormones. They are a class of molecule used to treat diseases such as diabetes. However, widespread use across diverse diseases has been severely limited compared to how many peptides are known. The promise of peptide biomaterials has also been limited because of several conspiring attributes. One is that, in using these molecules we are trying to make functional therapeutics out of that which we normally regard as food. Natural digestion processes break down peptides to amino acids before they can function. In addition, cells and tissues have physical barriers that prevent most foreign peptides from entering; an evolutionary feature that usually serves us well. These processes mean that peptides are short lived when given intravenously or orally as medicines. In addition, unlike large proteins such as antibodies, individual peptides lack the ability to make multiple contacts with target receptors that may be present on cells or invading pathogens. This is analogous to the difference between picking up a pen with one finger versus using an entire hand. We term this multivalency in target binding. This award focuses on the experimental and theoretical development of a new kind of peptide biomaterial formulation. These formulations display peptides at exceptionally high-density, enabling resistance to degradation, while maintaining and enhancing cell uptake and receptor binding, or gripping strength by multivalency. Through this effort to impact scientific problems of urgency and relevance to society, the award will establish a research internship for underrepresented post-baccalaureate students in science, to recruit them to STEM fields. The award will also enable outreach programs including one focused on clinicians interested in learning about future technologies of potential translational relevance arising from the fields of polymer chemistry and nanoscience.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>Peptides show tremendous potential as therapeutics and as tools in chemical biology. However, this promise has been consistently compromised by natural digestion processes and by chemical and physical barriers in cells and tissues. These processes mean that peptides suffer from short half-lives upon systemic (intravenous or oral) administration and are degraded or excluded entirely from cells and organs. In addition, they can be low molecular weight as individual strands, a feature contributing to rapid clearance when administered systemically and to a lack of multivalency in target binding. This award focuses on the experimental and theoretical development of polymer scaffolds that are capable of displaying peptides at exceptionally high density enabling resistance to degradation, while maintaining and enhancing cell uptake and bioactivity. Furthermore, the project offers opportunities for broader societal impact. This is based on the fact that peptides are exciting targets, ripe for development with new delivery methods for longstanding, and for emerging diseases alike. To fuel these scientific thrusts, the program has established a research internship for underrepresented post-baccalaureate students in science to prepare them to apply for graduate school. The multidisciplinary research program seeks to broaden the base of students coming into STEM fields by recruiting them to work on scientific problems of urgency and relevance to society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the Big Data revolution brings a great opportunity to obtain valuable and profound insights from the richness of data and to enhance data-driven decision making, it also brings challenging demands for innovation and knowledge discovery in three crucial aspects from statisticians and data scientists: (i) development of flexible models that can appropriately describe the complexities of the data (ii) efficient and valid statistical estimation and inferential procedures, and (iii) development of computational algorithms that scale-up to large datasets. The purpose of this project is to make advances in all the three aspects by fully exploring the Bayesian framework, which treats the parameters of a model to be random and provides an efficient mechanism to quantify the uncertainty of the model parameters. In particular, the techniques developed will be useful for analyzing datasets containing a large number of covariates, for learning the dependence structures between a large number of outcome variables, and for obtaining a comprehensive description of the impact of covariates on outcome variables by modeling their relationships at different quantile levels. The research developed will have impact on statistical practice in various disciplines including biology, economics, environmental sciences, marketing, and medical sciences. The training component will integrate research into teaching by offering special topics courses to graduate students based on the proposed research and by developing undergraduate research projects that incorporate research concepts at an accessible level. The PI will mentor high school research projects and organize a K-12 outreach workshop to provide exposure to modern statistics and its applications to high school students and teachers. <br/><br/>Statistically rigorous and computationally efficient Bayesian methodologies and inferential procedures will be developed which will be applicable for a variety of complex high dimensional models including generalized linear models, quantile regression models, and graphical models. General classes of Bayesian regularization priors will be proposed, and their regularization properties will be rigorously studied for a variety of commonly used likelihood functions. In contrast to most of the existing Bayesian approaches that focus on high dimensional estimation, a novel Bayesian framework for performing high dimensional Bayesian inference having valid frequentist properties will be developed. Scalable computational techniques that do not involve large matrix operations for obtaining point estimators from the posteriors as well as for sampling the full posterior distributions will be devised and their statistical properties will be studied. An attractive feature of the computational developments will be that they will be applicable to a diverse range of statistical models commonly used in practice. The research developed will be closely related to several highly active areas of modern statistics including high dimensional modeling, Bayesian computation, nonconvex regularization, post-selection inference, graphical models, and quantile regression, and will contribute to the advancement of and interaction between these areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A compelling explanation is the existence of hitherto unknown Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), and a world-wide experimental effort is on-going to test this hypothesis. The nature of Dark Matter (DM), so far elusive, constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science. Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. This project focuses on the DAMIC-M (Dark Matter In CCDs) experiment, which will search beyond the heavy WIMP paradigm by detecting nuclear recoils and electrons induced by light DM in charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The one-kg detector will be installed at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, France by an international collaboration. This award provides US support for the construction of the DAMIC-M detector.<br/><br/>Immersive research experiences, engagement of the local community and innovative partnerships will bring DM science to formal and informal audiences. Research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups - e.g., U. Chicago and Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge, the Community College Transfer Program at U. Washington - will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The local community will be broadly engaged in Chicago by integrating high school URM students of the Space Explorers Program and of the STEM Science Inquiry and Research program in a stimulating research environment, by enhancing the RISE program for URM middle-school students and by communicating science to older adults via the Life-long Learning program; in the Pacific Northwest by engaging science school teachers in research at U.

This has led to a wide range of very useful materials (such as fibers, plastics and adhesives) that are ubiquitous in our daily lives. One issue with such materials is that when they break or degrade it can be difficult and/or not cost effective to repair or recycle them. What if plastics could be accessed that would allow them to either heal scratches or deformations or to be more efficiently recycled. One way to achieve this is to design into the polymer structure reversible bonds that can be broken and remade upon application of a relatively small amount of heat or light. With this NSF funding the Rowan group is working on a range of different stimuli-responsive reversible bonds that will be incorporated into polymers and used to access new classes of responsive/adaptive materials. A key component of these systems is the ability to systematically control the stimulus required to access the reversible character of the bond which in turn allows them to be tailored for different applications. With these materials the Rowan group will focus on the development of (1) new soft actuators that act like 'polymeric muscles' and offer applications to (soft) robotics, (2) materials that exhibit both scratch-healing characteristics as well as enhanced toughness to extend their useful operational lifetime, and (3) on-demand reversible glues and adhesives. This project involves graduate and undergraduate students, students from local high schools, including students from underserved and predominately minority neighborhoods of Chicago. The integrated approach of this project provides students at all levels with an exciting learning environment and broad research experiences. In addition, Prof. Rowan and his research group will design new hands-on demonstrations for a Museum outreach program entitled ""Nature's Materials"", which is part of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's ""Winter Discovery Day"" on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  This program aims (i) to expose the local community to polymers and how Nature's materials can help us create a sustainable planet, and (ii) to train current graduate students on how to communicate to and educate the general public and younger students about science and technology.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The introduction of dynamic bonds (that can undergo reversible exchange) into a polymer network imparts new adaptive properties onto the materials. The adaptive properties come from the network's ability to alter its architecture (and/or composition) through dynamic bond exchange and as such have been termed structurally-dynamic polymers. Depending on the specific type, placement and amount of the dynamic bond incorporated into the network the resulting films will have the ability to be re-processable/re-moldable, exhibit healing and/or shape-memory properties, and even open the door to materials that have enhanced toughness, stress relaxation, and/or adaptive adhesion capabilities. This proposal outlines the synthetic as well as structural (via NMR, MALDI-MS, FT-IR, UV, POM and WAXS/SAXS) and mechanical (rheology, tensile testing, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) studies on three different classes of structurally-dynamic polymers, focusing not only on investigating the basic science of these systems but also on targeting specific applications that suit the specific dynamic behavior of the film's chemistry. Specifically, the Rowan group will focus on the synthesis, characterization, and investigation of (1) poly(disulfides), (2) thia-Michael adduct-containing polymers and (3) poly(alkylureas). While poly(disulfides) networks are known and have been investigated as healable materials, their use to access photo-adaptive liquid crystalline elastomers is new.  Specific interest is in accessing 3D actuating films with this class of material. The thia-Michael reaction can be dynamic at room temperature, but to date, this class of dynamic bond has received little attention in the polymer field. The advantage of this bond is that both its exchange thermodynamics and kinetics can be systematically altered by changing the electronics of the alkene (Michael acceptor). The final class of dynamic bond the PI will investigate is the most commercially relevant and is based on bulky alkylureas. Alkylureas are used as blocked (protected) isocyanates in the polyurethane industry that deblock at temperatures >100C. The PI will target/develop alkylureas and derivatives that can deblock at lower temperatures. The goal for these last two classes of materials is to develop structure/property relationships focusing on their solid state mechanical and adaptive properties."

Further, dark matter is known to exist from astronomical observations; however the particle properties of dark matter remain shrouded in mystery. The combined activities of the UIC group address those basic questions puzzling science - the origin of mass and the particle nature of dark matter - and have the potential for surprising discoveries that may change the way we understand our physical world.<br/><br/>The award also supports technological advances for high energy frontier experiments, in particular building and commissioning sophisticated high-speed electronics and silicon tracking systems for particle physics experiments.  The challenges faced in advancing those technologies enhance the disciplinary knowledge in engineering fields. The data analyses and hardware projects supported by this award provide valuable experience and knowledge for students and post doctoral associates at UIC, enabling them to pursue successful careers in the private sector, academia, or research laboratories. The UIC group also fosters close collaboration between high school teachers and the UIC group members, strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago-area high schools. As these high schools serve predominantly minority students, this project aims to increase the number of students from historically underrepresented groups that major in STEM disciplines."

Coherence is a phenomenon resulting from the quantum nature of semiconductors that plays an important role in determining energy and charge migration pathways within these materials and thus influences device performance. However, the role of coherence in charge transfer remains underexplored. This project is investigating how coherences involving molecular vibrations assist charge generation following light absorption by organic semiconductors. The graduate student participants in this project are being educated using an integrated approach that trains them to be problem solvers. The students are being taught to prepare complex materials and at the same time are learning the physical techniques necessary to answer the questions addressed by their research. This approach is very effective in developing the kind of intellectual flexibility necessary to meet the rapidly changing roles of scientists in society. This project also engages the broader community through outreach to elementary schools through to the collegiate level to educate and inspire the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Organic semiconductors suitable for photonic device applications must be designed for ultrafast photo-driven electron-hole pair formation and subsequent rapid charge transport over long distances. Many such materials are based on electron donor-acceptor molecular components, such that optimizing the performance of organic semiconductors requires a fundamental understanding of the microscopic aspects of charge transfer in donor-acceptor systems at the quantum mechanical level. The primary goal of this project is to investigate whether vibrational and/or vibronic coherences assist symmetry-breaking charge generation following photoexcitation of organic semiconductors. The secondary goals of the project are to investigate 1) whether higher-order polygonal structures in solids, i.e. tilings and tessellations, lead to coherences that assist charge separation in organic semiconductors, and 2) whether excitonic coherences resulting from energy transfer processes in organic semiconductors influence subsequent charge transfer within them. While charge transfer is inherently quantum mechanical, many of the salient features of electron transfer kinetics have been treated classically. However, these treatments largely ignore the role of quantum coherences between states as they are typically very short lived (~10-100 fs for electronic states, up to several ps for vibrational/vibronic states) and as such are assumed to have decayed prior to electron transfer. However, with increasingly advanced spectroscopic techniques and improvements in time resolution, it is now possible to probe these processes on the requisite timescales and observe these coherences and their effects directly, which will aid in the design of high-performance organic semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quite often in many applications, due to some local similarity or certain periodicity of a highly multidimensional array such as in image processing, the rank of such tensor usually appears to be significantly lower than its size. When a multi-dimensional array is governed by a low-rank structure, the handling of such a dataset becomes much more approachable, and more importantly, the low rank property indicates that the dataset can be significantly compressed in a meaningful way. This explains why the low rank characteristic is so attractive and practically useful in various applications. The broader significance and importance of this project are mainly reflected by two aspects: firstly, the project aims to promote the creation and development of the next generation of mathematical theory/tools for handling and processing high dimensional data sets more effectively and more efficiently, leading to expand the existing methodology; secondly, the project will enhance the multidisciplinary program for graduate/undergraduate student training and promote the mathematical learning interests for K-12 students in the local community, a rural area at Southern Illinois with many low-income families.<br/> <br/>During the last decade, the low rank approximation of tensors mainly focuses on convex regularization, and the approach appears to be insufficient due to the limitations of convex formulation. In this proposal, we will develop the low rank approximation of tensors via non-convex regularization, which currently is not well established yet for the study of multi-dimensional datasets. There exists very few study for tensors under the non-convex formulation at this point. In this proposal, we propose a framework in which equivalent problems can be formulated in the Fourier domain, where tensor ranks can be characterized in a more approachable way. In this framework, the non-convex formulation can provide more effective approach for tensor related problems than the existing methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award supports the US groups involved in the XENON1T dark matter search program at the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) underground laboratory.<br/><br/>The XENON project continues to captivate the imagination of the public. This is evidenced, for example, by several TV shows such as ""The Big Bang Theory"", which on several occasions featured XENON plots and results. Public interest in science is encouraged through talks and outreach activities. XENON1T will play a significant role in solving the dark matter puzzle, by either detecting WIMPs, or putting them under immense pressure as viable dark matter candidates. In addressing this fundamental physics problem, these awards will engage many undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers, exposing them to a variety of subjects in physics and cosmology, and training them in state-of-the-art technologies, thus preparing to become future leaders in the field. Finally, the instrumentation and techniques used in XENON are relevant to a wide range of applications, from areas in homeland security and medical imaging, to the analysis and statistical treatment of large data sets.<br/><br/>The program for the next four years will focus on the continued operation of the XENON1T experiment and its science data analysis. The international XENON Collaboration of 130 scientists continues to be led by the PI at Columbia University with key roles served by US members both in the management of the experiment and its scientific program. XENON1T uses the largest liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) built to-date, with 2 tonnes active Xe target, and the highest sensitivity to dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), at the level of 2  10^-47 cm^2 for 40 GeV WIMPs. With funding of this proposal, the US will remain in the lead of the direct search for dark matter well beyond the end of the decade."

These transfer processes play a vital role in living organisms, as well as in energy production and storage.  Reactions involving light particles and energy transfer are dominated by quantum mechanical effects.  These effects are based on the idea that elementary particles (protons, electrons, etc.) also behave as waves and thus, have mathematical interpretations of their structure and interactions with other matter.  Quantum mechanical effects cannot be modeled correctly using classical treatments. Professor Makri and her coworkers design new theoretical and computational approaches for circumventing this problem; their approaches produce more accurate and efficient simulation algorithms.  The resulting software may aid in the interpretation of experimental results.  The new software enhances the learning experience in the classroom by augmenting the visualization ability offered by classical simulations.  The project offers graduate students and a postdoctoral researchers opportunities to receive training in quantum dynamics, mastering state-of-the-art theoretical ideas and simulation tools. <br/><br/>The traditional formulation of quantum mechanics is based on wave functions, which require array storage that far exceeds current computer capabilities.

This stretching of the brittle ceramics can cause problems for their durability when they are constrained in devices, such as sensors, reactors, batteries, and fuel cells: it can cause cracks and fracture. On the other hand, this ?breathing? behavior raises the possibility to develop a new application: actuators for use in extreme environments. Additionally, over the past 5-10 years, advanced materials characterization techniques that leverage this behavior have emerged. Therefore, it is an excellent time to measure and understand the breathing more completely and to investigate how to design materials with controlled size changes. This project focuses on a technologically important class of ceramics, called perovskites, and seeks to understand how their structure at the level of local charge, atom, and bond arrangements impacts how they change size during breathing. Experiments are testing three specific ideas about how the local structure of these materials can be tailored to control the amount of expansion. Students are being trained to observe the stretching across many length scales, using precise expansion measurements, advanced microscopy techniques, and the intense light sources available at national laboratories. The expected outcome is knowledge of how to design ceramics with better durability for energy conversion and storage applications and tailored responses for novel actuators and optimized measurements. These research efforts are integrated with educational approaches including international exchange visits to Japan, which train students to be clear communicators, cross-culturally sensitive, both computationally and experimentally literate, and motivated toward deep learning. A new summer camp module links to the research applications in sustainable energy. It aims to encourage participation of under-represented groups in materials science at the undergraduate level by intervening at the high school level to increase students? confidence, motivation, and self-efficacy.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The project seeks to establish quantitative relationships between bond architecture, local point defect-induced distortions, and macroscopic chemically-induced strain in mixed- and proton-conducting perovskite oxides. Point defects govern the behavior of technical ceramics, and this work?s insight into the structure of defects and their role in chemo-mechanical coupling will add to the development of the ?defect genome.? Methods including dilatometry, in situ diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, advanced electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption and scattering, are being used to quantify stoichiometry changes, defect-induced local distortions, and macroscopic strain. The outcome will be the establishment of crystal chemical design rules for tailored coefficients of chemical expansion. These rules can be applied to improve durability and optimize responses of ceramics in energy conversion, storage, sensing, and actuation applications. Additionally, students will be trained in not only technical skills in university and national laboratory settings, but also in a variety of broader professional skills in a global context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solid state materials underpin many products and processes on which our modern society depends.  This project deals with the broader question:  How do we discover and synthesize new solid state materials? It develops the fundamental science and principles of synthesis and how they can be used as tool to design and synthesize useful new materials.  Specifically, the project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, focuses on developing the chemistry of metal chalcogenides. Chalcogenides are compounds of sulfur, selenium and tellurium and they are important in a broad variety of scientific investigations and technologies.  The project pursues chalcogenide materials discovery as a science coupled with the study of crystal structure, physical properties including ion-exchange, charge transport and photo-response of the new materials.  The primary goals are to learn how reactions leading to solid state chalcogenides can be controlled so known materials can be avoided and new materials can be accessed. This research activity enhances, as well as challenges, our scientific understanding.  It will also enhance the effectiveness of existing technological applications and impact new applications. Possible technological impact could be via new semiconductors, materials with high Li mobility, quantum materials and ion-exchange sorbent materials for environmental remediation.  The project provides diverse opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, to learn critical thinking skills that will help advance future scientific research.  Additionally, the educational program encompasses outreach to high schools on ion exchange materials and dissemination of YouTube videos on safe use of the advanced synthetic methods used in the project. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This project pursues chalcogenide materials discovery as a science coupled with the study of crystal structure, physical properties including ion-exchange, charge transport and photo-response of the new materials.  Within an overarching theme of contributing to fundamental understanding of synthesis, particularly using flux-based methods, the project studies: (a) the understanding the synthesis of complex Li-containing chalcogenide phases; (b) the formation of stable boron clusters as building blocks in chalcogenides; (c) the understanding of the synthesis routes that lead to subchalcogenides with low-valent metals; (d) the rational design of ion-exchangers. The expected benefits are:  i) broad new insights regarding the reactivity and stability of lithium-containing chalcogenide phases;  ii), expansion of the small class of the little-known boron cluster-based chalcogenides;  iii) new chemistry and bonding in subchalcogenides and their impact on physical and chemical properties, and iv) delineation of the factors involved in the selective binding of heavy soft metal ions by metal sulfides ion-exchangers and use of this knowledge to create novel compositions using ion-exchange chemistry.  Possible technological impact of these materials could be new semiconductors for radiation detection, materials with high Li mobility, topological quantum materials, open framework systems, and ion-exchange sorbent materials for environmental remediation.

The waves that LIGO detected were the result of a cataclysmic collision of two black holes, each 30 times more massive than our own Sun, crashing into each other at half the speed of light. This detection of gravitational waves has opened up an entirely new way for us to explore our Universe. We will learn about the very first stars in the Universe, how elements such as gold were made in the Universe, and we will also test Einstein's theory of gravity (a fundamental pillar of physics). This project is to help develop this entirely new field of gravitational-wave astrophysics, and to explore what LIGO will teach us about astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The first major theme of this project is LIGO Astrophysics. In the near future interesting LIGO constraints will arise from statistical analyses rather than individual events. For example, we can anticipate three general astrophysical quantities of interest: 1. the rate of mergers of compact binary systems, 2. the mass and mass ratio distributions of these mergers, and 3. the spin distributions of the component systems. The PI will help produce these distributions and the attendant science. This work is at the heart of the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics. In addition to this core work, the PI will engage in a number of related projects, including the modeling of spins in hierarchical formation channels, the use of Gaussian Process Emulators to model waveforms from compact binary coalescence, the role of systematic errors in LIGO astrophysics, and LIGO's ability to constrain electromagnetically charged black holes. The second major theme of the project is Multi-Messenger Astronomy, which focuses on the next gravitational-wave revolution: identifying electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave sources. This will shed light on the underlying astrophysical processes and elucidate the formation channels of these gravitational-wave events. In addition, multi-messenger astronomy offers the potential to use gravitational-wave sources as standard candles to constrain cosmology. The PI plans the development of tools and pipelines to hasten the arrival of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy, including facilitating electromagnetic follow-up efforts through the continuing refinement and implementation of low-latency 3D localization algorithms and the optimization of follow-up resource allocation. This project will help LIGO reach its tremendous potential as an astronomical observatory."

Such control is critical to the future of electronics, computers, and quantum information science (QIS). The degree of control over molecular structure and properties afforded by this research makes it possible to develop molecules and materials that take advantage of electron spin changes to implement new strategies for computer of the future that may have speeds and encryption technologies far beyond the current models. The Wasielewski research group volunteers in the Science In The Classroom program (SITC), with 3rd/4th-graders at an elementary school in an historically under-served and diverse community in Chicago. Approximately one third of the classes served by SITC are multilingual, and learn English as a second language alongside the regular curriculum. By volunteering with the same class of students for the academic year, Northwestern students mentor and inspire young scientists.

This project will address several goals based on what are known in the QIS field as the DiVincenzo criteria, which are essential for exploiting multi-radical assemblies as spin qubits that target QIS applications. Professor Wasielewski and his group use two spin-selective photophysical processes to hyperpolarize electron spins to generate well-defined initial quantum states of spin qubits and determine the dephasing mechanisms of the spin qubits.  The team then manipulates and addresses specific spin qubits to demonstrate quantum gates and uses both microwave and visible photon pulses to move (teleport) spin coherences between two sites.  Finally, the team establishes strategies for scalable spin qubit arrays based on DNA hairpin structures. They use laser excitation to generate the initial hyperpolarized spin qubits and time-resolved pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (pulse-EPR) spectroscopy to observe, manipulate and control the coherent spin states of these qubits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, there is a critical need for new materials and novel structures that may follow the meteoritic growth of conventional silicon microelectronic technology of the past few decades. In this context, new scientific opportunities are presented by emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially those whose composition can be tailored and optimized. Ever since the discovery of graphene, a single 2D layer of carbon atoms, which was the subject of Physics Nobel prize a decade ago, other 2D layered structures are being pursued worldwide. This research focuses on a new class of 2D layered materials, called chalcophosphates where phosphorous, sulphur and analogous elements are arranged in an intricate planar mosaic pattern. This research develops and explores metal chalcophosphates as a new class of ceramic materials for their magnetic, ferroelectric, and coupled properties, with unusual quantum behavior. This unique combination of non-linear phenomena provide rich opportunities to advance science of ceramics, and creates a potential platform for new generation of magneto-electronic devices. This emerging research field is likely to generate new technology industries and require workforce with extensive hands-on expertise in novel multicomponent ceramic materials and their characterization. As a result, research activities are integrated with educational and societal outreach initiatives, anchored by the unique platform for 2D layered ceramic materials. The other broader impact goals include training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced materials research and incorporation of research results into course and curricula. Through an innovative ""Materials-Journalism"" program, Medill school journalism students immerse to witness the scientific process and report their findings in their journalism blogs and reports. Conversely, the research team members learn journalism practices of story-telling and how to synthesize complex scientific undertaking into meaningful discourse with the public. Collectively, the research advances scientific insights with prospects for technology breakthroughs in the new class of 2D ceramics, with educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and societal outreach through the journalism initiative.<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research revolves around synthesis and advanced characterization of 2D layered metal chalcophosphates (MCP), i.e. thiophosphates and selenophosphates, as a new and novel class of 2D layered ceramic systems. Anchored on a variety of possible chemical combinations, especially with heteroanions, the synthesized structures are readily amenable to extensive multimodal characterization methods to map their complex structural characteristics in conjunction with their linear and non-linear properties. Of specific interest are single- and few layered 2D structures to explore the role of spatial and dimensional constraints. This goal is accomplished by classical mechanical exfoliation as well as vapor-based deposition methods developed in the laboratory. Also, this project investigates the nature and extent of coupling between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties, especially in the few- and single layers. The primarily focus is on magnetic M2P2Q6 (M= Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Q=S, Se) and ferroelectric/ferromagnetic AMP2Q6 (A=Ag,Cu, M=In,Ga,Cr,Mn,Fe,Gd). A diverse yet integrated multimodal techniques and characterization methods are employed to unravel the complex labyrinth of microstructure across multiple length-scales. Advanced scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques probe the local structure, phases, chemical partitioning, and related phenomena. Theoretical work conducted in close connection with the experimental efforts examines the bulk properties of materials and analyzes the meso and nano-scale phenomena in heterostrucure architectures of thio- and selenophosphates and its interaction with substrates. The scientific insights governed by unusual combination of heteroanion systems with spatial and dimensional constraints are expected to display unusual linear and non-linear ferroelectric and ferromagnetic as well as coupled properties and phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interface between an electrode and an ionic solution is a crucial part of batteries, supercapacitors and other devices. Surrounding ions affect the physical properties of membranes and modify the behavior of proteins and DNA. Understanding the structure and properties of ions at interfaces is crucial to extracting them from water, whether for desalinization, removal of lead, arsenic or radioactive elements from groundwater or wastewater, or increasing the supply or rare earth materials for modern electronics. All these systems and processes would benefit from a better nanoscale view of how ions actually arrange themselves near wet surfaces.  This project uses synchrotron X-rays to look directly at how ions are arranged near wet surfaces, while varying the surface, the ion, the concentration, the temperature, etc. What is learned from this research will help verify or refute theoretical predictions, and may also ultimately help design systems with specific properties for practical applications. This project trains graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment and gives them experience in the use of synchrotron facilities. Project-related topics are being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses and web-disseminated teaching materials.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>A variety of novel and/or counterintuitive behaviors have been observed in aqueous solutions containing ions.  For example, charged interfaces sometimes attract more counterions than simple electrostatics would predict (""charge inversion"").  Though hydrophobic (nonpolar) surfaces repel water, they are thought to attract certain ions towards the interface. The effects of ions at interfaces and around macromolecules can be strongly ion-specific, e.g. different lanthanides behave very differently. Such effects are exploited, for example, in liquid-liquid separations processes used to extract lanthanides and actinides from solution, but the origins are not understood. These anomalous behaviors are likely to have structural origins.  X-ray scattering studies of interfaces, where one side of the interface is a solution containing ions, are performed in this project. The goal is to characterize the distributions normal to the interfaces, and also to understand whether and under what conditions the ions order laterally to form condensed interfacial phases with modified properties.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  The Standard Model predicted that there were three different kinds of neutrinos, all massless, that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they undergo whenever they interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will make comprehensive measurements of neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations to investigate neutrino CP violation, determine the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates, and perform precision tests of the neutrino Standard Model. DUNE will take advantage of both an accelerator-based neutrino beam from Fermilab and be sensitive to extra-terrestrial neutrinos, including those from supernova explosions. DUNE's massive detector, a 40-kton Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) System, will both enable these precision measurements in neutrino physics and astrophysics as well as extend the sensitivity in the search for nucleon decay.  <br/><br/>The LAr-TPC System will be divided into four 10-kton modules.  At the heart of two of these large modules are wire chamber planes called Anode Plane Assemblies (APA) which record the signatures of particles propagating in the argon and provide high resolution images of neutrino interactions.  The groups leading this planning project, funded in part through earlier investments from the NSF, have led the development of wire chamber planes for LAr-TPC experiments laying the groundwork for DUNE.  These groups will now develop a construction strategy, methodology and plan to construct half of the APAs needed for the first two 10-kton modules of DUNE.  It is envisioned that 2-3 APA ""factories"" would be built at university sites that have the technical facilities and infrastructure required to host the APA production lines. These multiple regional factories would allow for direct participation by many collaborating university groups.   Ultimately, developing and then operating an APA construction program would provide excellent training opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. It is anticipated that the project would interest and engage a diverse group of undergraduate students at each of the construction sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It includes current participation of one local high school student developing state-of-the-art software, science education of student teams from elementary school and from a local high school, and an ongoing research project of an undergraduate student to develop a novel detection instrument for a new generation of nuclear physics experiments.  These activities are outgrowths of, and made possible by, the PI's silica aerogel growth laboratory.  One success story involves three young 7th grade girls who learned to grow silica alcogels as part of a science competition that won state and then national-regional championships. The present project supports this educational program with mentoring from the PI and his graduate student team.  In fact, the central part of the research project is focused on quantum fluids confined within aerogel, an extremely porous glass used to engineer new quantum states of superfluid helium at ultra-low temperatures, a key component of the project.  The importance of low temperature research and technology in today's quantum world is that it drives development of instrumentation, pushing limits in temperature ever lower, where the PI's laboratory has made significant contributions.  This work supplies a need for trained postdocs and new faculty appointments in experimental condensed matter physics and inspires recruitment of young scientists with background in many body physics, complex symmetry breaking, and quantum phase transitions. Investigation of the superfluid helium-three paradigm provides guidance for solutions to some of the challenging scientific problems of the day, ranging from qubit coherence in quantum information science to materials physics. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Superfluid helium-three is a known topological quantum condensed system that is predicted to host Majorana fermionic excitations in the form of quasiparticle bound states, a subject of interest to researchers in the field of quantum information science.  The proposal, Engineering New Anisotropic Superfluid Phases of Helium-three, is a platform for both basic research and instrumentation development. Today it is known that it is possible to stabilize new types of helium-three superfluid phases exhibiting different spontaneously-broken symmetries by engineering anisotropy through confinement of the superfluid in highly porous, anisotropic, aerogels or in thin films.  Each phase has its specific type of orbital and/or spin topological singularities including vortices and superfluid textures of its orbital and spin angular momenta. The surface of the superfluid B-phase, and the vortex cores in the superfluid A-phase, the latter being a chiral phase, are predicted to harbor Majorana fermions of intense interest to researchers in quantum information science.  Chirality, in this context, is the combination of loss of mirror symmetry in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, a key property of topological superconductivity.   In the proposed work new anisotropic phases of superfluid helium-three are investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance and resonant acoustic cavity techniques for a wide range of magnetic field and temperature.  Recent success in the PI's laboratory on which the proposed program builds, is the capability of continuously holding temperatures below 0.001 K, for as long as several months. These extremely efficient refrigerators allow maintenance of quantum coherence over long time scales and offer opportunities for improvement in qubit performance, an essential requirement for quantum information processing.   Preliminary results are promising for understanding the unusual interplay of anisotropy and magnetic field.  One aspect of this research is motivated by prediction of a topological thermodynamic phase transition of Majorana fermions at the free surface of topological superfluid helium-three-B.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Andrew Mitchell in the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University. Often referred to as the central science, chemistry continues to demonstrate extensive utility. Organic chemistry advances biology, medicine, physics, materials, economic development, national defense, and environmental sustainability. Professor Mitchell and his students study important bond-forming reactions called cycloadditions. These reactions perform a crucial function within the discipline of organic synthesis by enabling efficient and selective transformations of flat molecules to three-dimensional building blocks that are embedded within biologically active compounds. Although new reaction discoveries are intellectually fascinating, Dr. Mitchell is equally passionate about training next generation scientists to ask important questions within an organic chemistry CORE (Collaboration, Outreach, Research, Education) curriculum in preparation for the chemical workforce. Collaboration invites students in a research laboratory to work with a range of other scientists. Creativity, teamwork, presentation, deeper understanding, and characterization of new compounds are taught in this environment. For example, students learn to think on their feet and engage in nuanced scientific discussions during lab work and group meetings. Outreach provides opportunities for high school students, many from underrepresented groups, to participate in research experiences during the summer. Research in the undergraduate environment opens the door for greater sophistication through mentorship, critical reasoning, and exposure to state-of-the-art instrumentation as students take ownership of knowledge acquired in coursework.

New synthetic methods and strategies enable the construction of compounds that are essential for advancements in many scientific disciplines, including chemical biology and materials science. Such synthesis opens access to diverse compounds that help us understand biological processes.  New synthetic methods also help chemists prepare large quantities of drugs more cheaply. The Rawal lab examines cycloaddition reactions, which are reactions wherein two molecules are brought together to form a ring. These are one of the most important families of reactions for the synthesis of intricate molecules.  The methods allow for the creation of new compounds and provide students with a rigorous training in reaction development, and the design and synthesis of molecules, thereby preparing them for careers in academics or industry. Undergraduate students and high school students from the Chicago Public School system are also gaining exposure to scientific research through this award.  They learn about the many opportunities and careers available to them in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Professor Rawal is developing new cycloaddition methodologies for the synthesis of complex molecules. He and his students are designing novel substrates for the Diels-Alder (DA) reaction, particularly the meta-selective DA reaction, for the construction of substituted cyclohexanones that are key building blocks to many complex natural products. Given the tremendous need for single enantiomer compounds, with estimated global sales topping $1.3 trillion in 2018, the Rawal lab is examining chiral catalysts to render meta-selective DA reactions enantioselective. This work is providing ready access to important compounds, particularly compounds containing all-carbon quaternary chiral centers, that previously were difficult to synthesize. To demonstrate the unique power of the new chemistry, the Rawal lab is carrying out the chemical synthesis of selected, intricate natural products. This research program is also helping to develop human resources in science and technology through the education and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  Importantly, this project is exposing undergraduate students and high school students in the University of Chicago Collegiate Scholars Program to career opportunities in scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The Standard Model predicted that there were three different kinds of neutrinos, all massless, that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they undergo whenever they interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another.   Additionally, experimental measurements have indicated the possibility of yet an additional type of sterile neutrino.   Detailed measurements of the interactions of these unusual particles are one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The Short-baseline Neutrino (SBN) Experiment at Fermilab, for which Chicago is a co-spokesperson group, will address whether the various anomalies observed in several neutrino experiments could be indications of new physics and in particular the existence of low-mass ""sterile"" neutrino particles.   The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will make comprehensive measurements of neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations to investigate neutrino CP violation, determine the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates, and perform precision tests of the neutrino Standard Model. DUNE will take advantage of both an accelerator-based neutrino beam from Fermilab and be sensitive to extra-terrestrial neutrinos, including those from supernova explosions.<br/><br/>Both experiments employ a transformative detector technology for neutrino physics, the liquid argon time projection chamber, which DUNE aims to realize at unprecedented scales, and for which the SBN detectors are providing invaluable experience in the construction, operation, and analysis of data.   The Chicago group plays a leading role in the design and construction of the near detector, SBND, and in preparation of both near detector and multi-detector physics analyses.   On DUNE, the group has taken a leading role in development of the final design and production plan for the experiment's large wire planes, called Anode Plane Assemblies, the primary detection element of the DUNE Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers.  <br/><br/>The Chicago group supports and co-leads the Enrico Fermi Summer Interns program, a long-running educational program for middle school students from south-side Chicago public schools.  Recognizing the importance of reaching students at an early age in the education process, the program engages the students in concepts of particle physics and gives them hands-on exposure to creative projects based on modern electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The unique properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) make them candidates for materials used in detection technologies. Critical for the success of emerging detection technologies is the attachment of proteins, i.e., antibodies, onto the surface of the AuNPs. Despite extensive efforts in the area of antibody-AuNP conjugation chemistry, current attachment chemistries are not universally applicable to all antibodies, often diminish the function of the antibody, and result in compounds with limited stability. In an effort to address these challenges and to realize the full potential of AuNP-enabled assays, Dr. Jeremy Driskell and his research group at Illinois State University are investigating the underlying principles of the antibody-AuNP interaction.  This research is conducted with the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program. These studies will promote the rational design of highly active and stable antibody-AuNP conjugates. The project provides an intense research experience to undergraduate students who learn advanced analytical techniques and gain an appreciation for a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving. Additionally, Dr. Driskell and his undergraduate students participate in the Illinois Summer Research Academy, an educational outreach program that provides high school students from across the nation with an opportunity to work in a research laboratory.  <br/><br/>Despite many successful examples of antibody-AuNP conjugates, immobilization chemistry still presents a challenge. Direct adsorption of the antibody onto AuNPs is often effective; however, adsorption conditions vary among proteins in an unpredictable manner and the activity of the conjugate is variable. Dr. Driskell's research seeks to identify the underlying principles that cause some antibodies to adsorb onto AuNPs to form stable, highly active conjugates, while other antibodies adsorb weakly and/or exhibit poor binding activity. Dr. Driskell's lab investigates the adsorption dynamics of antibodies onto AuNPs by measuring the adsorption affinity, orientation, reversibility, and displacement by other proteins. Antibodies are chemically modified to precisely alter the protein charge. A systematic investigation into adsorption elucidates the foundational principles needed to build a predictive model for effective surface modification. These efforts support Dr. Driskell's long-term goal of developing a strategy to immobilize antibodies onto AuNPs to form highly active, oriented, and stable conjugates for use in AuNP-enabled immunoassays.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mosquitoes are the most widely distributed disease vectors and are a serious threat to human life and health. West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the mosquito-borne diseases for which there is still no effective treatment; to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported over 40,000 cases across the United States. Temperature and precipitation are the two most important weather variables that affect mosquito populations and thus affect the WNV transmission cycle.  The mosquito infection rate (MIR) is considered an important mediator to study WNV risk. Based on surveillance data for WNV in Illinois, this project aims to develop new methodologies and algorithms to study WNV and MIR using weather and environmental variables. Specifically, the investigators plan first to make predictions of MIR and then characterize the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation to identify the risk level of WNV human illness and MIR. They will also establish a WNV Index to provide a reliable and interpretable warning for vector-borne disease risk. Finally, since mosquito-borne diseases are particularly affected by rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and a higher frequency of extreme weather events, the project aims to both quantitatively and qualitatively project the current risk to the future under climate change. The research will foster fundamental statistical methodology development as well as collaborations between statistics and public health. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in aspects of the scientific research. The project will provide new results on the impact of climate change on national security, of general interest and importance to the wider public and policymakers.<br/><br/>The methods of this project include a spatially-varying-coefficient model with functional weather covariates to make predictions of MIR, as well as a multiple-testing approach to characterize the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation for ultimately classifying the weather pattern into different risk levels with respect to WNV. The statistical models and algorithms learned from the historical data will be applied to downscaled future weather data to study the impact of climate change on WNV human illness and MIR. The analyses will be based on massive data including WNV human cases, MIR, current and future spatio-temporal stochastic weather processes, land cover, and the length of daylight. The statistical methods used in the project are not only effective for this WNV study but can be a general methodology for a wide range of vector-borne diseases. The spatially-varying-coefficient model with functional covariates takes the continuous and dynamic influence of the retrospective weather on MIR into account while allowing the relationship between MIR and weather and other environmental variables to vary over a spatial domain. The characterization of the spatial weather pattern and the establishment of WNV Index provide a new perspective to study and prevent WNV risk. Compared to previous methods that evaluate the difference between two spatio-temporal random fields as a whole, the multiple-testing approach in this project can detect exactly where the differences occur. This feature is crucial for regional risk detection. Quantifying the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases is essential to policymakers; the results of the project are expected to provide a reliable resource for such purposes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These neutrino experiments are all located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The MicroBooNE experiment should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether predicted ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. In addition to the contribution to the fundamental neutrino physics mentioned above, this research will serve as an invaluable proving ground for the calibration, reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments, such as the planned DUNE experiment, a success.<br/><br/>The Broader Impact of the project involves bringing current techniques in high energy physics to the broader local community. The south side neighborhoods surrounding the UChicago campus are largely populated with underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and this project aims to build a program within the Department of Physics that connects university students with local elementary and middle school children to introduce them to concepts in physics with the aid of fun, interactive demonstrations."

The ultimate goal is to gain insights leading to optimization of these designer nanocomposites for applications as wavelength shifters pertaining to up- and down-converters in solar cells and light emitting diodes. Pulsed laser deposition is used to synthesize layered nanocomposite materials so that very fine control of the distribution of the optically-active dopant and the nanocrystalline structure responsible for the optical behavior is achieved, leading to the development of a glass ceramic with enhanced light output. Systematic studies of optical behavior, as a function of parameters such as the designed distribution of the optically-active component layers within the glass matrix and the relative concentrations of optical dopants and nanocrystals, enable an understanding of how energy transfer between the luminescent dopant atoms and the nanocrystals (and thus the optical efficiency) can be controlled. The combination of in situ transmission electron microscopy, ellipsometry and X-ray diffraction enables the structure-property relationships to be visualized and linked together. For example, critical control over optimum dopant position can be achieved by studying the diffusion paths of the dopants during in situ heating."

Due to a range of superlative properties and new physics in the atomically thin limit, 2D materials have attracted significant interest for fundamental studies and prototype device development. Thus far, chemically inert 2D materials have been the most widely studied since they can be processed in ambient conditions with minimal further precautions. However, the family of 2D materials has hundreds of additional members, which have been underexplored due to their high chemical reactivities that introduce challenges in preparing and handling samples for electronic testing. To address this knowledge gap, this project develops encapsulation and related sample preparation protocols to enable characterization of the fundamental properties of chemically reactive 2D materials. Of particular interest are the 2D metal halides since they are theoretically predicted to possess unique combinations of electronic and magnetic properties that are relevant to next-generation computing and quantum technologies. These research results are widely disseminated to diverse audiences through a series of education and outreach activities including Illuminate, which assists and enables low-income, first-generation, and/or underrepresented minority students to attend and complete college, and Science with Seniors, which organizes visits to retirement homes for interactive science presentations and demonstrations.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Among the most chemically reactive two-dimensional (2D) materials are the layered van der Waals transition metal halides. Due to their high chemical reactivity, experimental studies of bulk metal halides are rare and have traditionally required an inert environment and/or vacuum equipment. However, theoretical models have predicted many layered metal halides to be mechanically exfoliatable due to low cleavage energies and large in-plane bond strength, suggesting that they could be explored in the 2D limit if suitable passivation and processing conditions were identified. This project develops atomic layer deposition encapsulation layers that allow 2D metal halides to be handled, processed, and tested in ambient conditions. Preceding atomic layer deposition, the 2D metal halides are passivated with organic buffer layers that minimize charge trapping and scattering, thus allowing intrinsic properties to be probed. The interplay among the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D metal halides is characterized as a function of temperature using lateral field-effect transistors, vertical heterostructures, and Hall bar electrode arrays. By elucidating fundamental charge transport phenomena such as the quantized anomalous Hall effect, this work provides guidance to emerging efforts to incorporate 2D metal halides into advanced magneto-electronic applications including spintronic devices, quantum technologies, and non-volatile memory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two-dimensional substrates offer a unique platform to study NCs owing to their large and well-defined surfaces with no dangling bonds, and minimal scattering of electrons, which allows for imaging of NCs with atomic resolution. The goal of this research is to employ a self-consistent, combined theoretical and experimental approach to study supported metal NCs, and how these adapt by substrate variations. The theoretical calculations are based on classical and quantum theories in conjunction with evolutionary algorithms, while as the experimental approach relies on electron microscopy to determine the structure at the nanoscale. Educationally, the proposed research will serve as an interdisciplinary platform for graduate and undergraduate students to learn about materials discovery at the nanoscale. Given the significant impact that novel materials will have on much of daily life and the national economy, this work will strengthen materials education at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Illinois at Chicago via developing new course components and novel education modules, as well as conducting outreach activities for pre-college and high school students.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The atomic structure of supported sub-nanometer clusters on two-dimensional (2D) substrates is a scientifically challenging and largely unexplored field of study. Upon completion, this work will determine how variations in 2D substrates can impact the atomic structure of supported NCs. The atomic structures are predicted using a genetic algorithm utilizing atomistic force fields and density functional theory, which are then validated using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Significantly, correlating experimental results with theoretical predictions will lead to advances in the fundamental understanding of supported metals on 2D substrates that could be the basis for using such substrates as a means to control the structure of the metal clusters at the atomic scale. The proposed research efforts will be further integrated with educational efforts where graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in multidisciplinary research. Dedicated effort and resources will be used to recruit and support underrepresented students (women, African-Americans, Hispanics, and first-generation) in the proposed research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bone, for example, displays high toughness at low weight and is capable of self-repair; some invertebrate teeth self-sharpen despite continuous wear. Organisms typically form these materials under mild conditions through environmentally sustainable processes, making them appealing targets for bio-inspired or bio-enabled syntheses. Despite the abundance of such materials in nature, many biological mechanisms that allow the organism to control their formation remain poorly understood. As a model organism, sea urchins exert remarkable control over mineralization, creating smoothly curving and branched, yet single crystalline endoskeletal spicules of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Previously, the team designed an in vitro culture system of sea urchin embryo primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) to control the growth of these spicules in the laboratory. They discovered that a signaling protein, VEGF, controls the shape of spicules deposited by PMCs. The team will next probe the roles of a number of proteins that have been identified as potential crystal growth regulators in transcriptomics experiments. Techniques include, proteomics, in vitro assays in microfluidic droplet reactors, and knock-down experiments in vivo. In combination, these studies will lead to an improved understanding of biologically controlled mineralization. Poised at the intersection of molecular biology, materials science, and bioengineering, this research has the potential to inform a wealth of new technologies, from bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials to materials for carbon dioxide sequestration. The team will to leverage the interdisciplinary potential of this research to train undergraduate and graduate students from a broad range of backgrounds. An undergraduate research assistant will learn fundamental biological laboratory skills while also using advanced materials characterization techniques. Finally, the team will utilize instrumentation developed as part of a NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant to help undergraduate students visualize phase transformations in seawater, thus broadening the project?s reach to fundamental materials science education.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: <br/>The proposed activities address gaps in the understanding of how living organisms control crystal growth processes, with the long-term objective to develop bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials. In prior work, the team discovered the role of VEGF signaling in branching of endoskeletal single crystals of calcite that are deposited by primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) of the sea urchin embryo. Going forward, the team will use quantitative proteomics to confirm proteins that have been identified by transcriptomics as candidates involved in crystal growth control. Selected proteins will be produced recombinantly, and recombinant antibodies (rAbs) will be raised against them. rAbs will be used to map proteins across the spicule deposition vesicle and the spicule itself. In parallel, the team will use existing microfluidic devices to dissect the impact of native and recombinant proteins, individually and collectively on nucleation, polymorph selection, and crystal growth. Finally, the team will complement these experiments with functional analyses in vivo. Taken together, the team expects to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of how expression of the relevant proteins, localization in the spicule matrix, and impact on nucleation kinetics and crystal growth may be connected. This is an important first step towards translating key molecular players into a system that is more easily engineered and scaled up, using the tools of synthetic biology for materials processing. The team will thereby address all four challenges in hard materials identified in the Report on the 2012 NSF Biomaterials Workshop. Complementary to the proposed research objectives, the team will engage undergraduates in research, incorporate research outcomes into undergraduate laboratory modules, and host high school interns through Northwestern University's Science in Society program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complementing observations of real galaxies, researchers use computational simulations to model the early Universe and study the results.  This process allows one to learn how these first galaxies might have formed.  However, the sheer size and complexity of such galaxy simulations present their own challenge as a single research group lacks the capacity to explore them fully.  As a result, maximizing the scientific value of simulations demands new tools and services designed to foster the growth of a collaborative, multi-group research community.  This project aims to develop and use a new virtual laboratory to enable transformative scientific inquiry on new and existing galaxy simulations, some of which were produced by prior NSF support.  Enabling public access and unrestricted analysis and fostering a collaborative environment for sharing technology and results will ensure that galaxy simulations continue to be valuable within and beyond the research group that originally conducted them.  This project addresses the national imperative to develop US cyber infrastructure and to develop US leadership in scientific research in astrophysics.<br/><br/>More technically, with prior NSF support the investigators used the Blue Waters supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) to perform the Renaissance Simulations: among the largest, most detailed simulations of the formation and evolution of the first galaxies to date.  The Renaissance Simulations yielded a sample of over 3,000 high redshift (20 > z > 7) galaxies and were specifically designed to simulate the dominant sources responsible for preheating the intergalactic medium and reionization at an unprecedented level of detail.  This project plans two related activities: (1) further analysis of the Renaissance Simulations; and (2) the creation of an open-data access portal, the Renaissance Simulation Laboratory (RSL), which will provide open access to this unique data corpus along with associated data analysis tools for the astronomical research community.  Driving its design and utility, the investigators will use the RSL to carry out their own research investigations.  The investigators' research processes will become part of the RSL in the form of executable ""Jupyter"" notebooks.  The Jupyter Notebook, an evolution of the iPython Notebook, is a fundamental part of the RSL and is ushering in the era of open science.  The investigators' use of Docker containers is equally compelling.  By containerizing Jupyter Notebooks which execute pre-programmed data analysis workflows the investigators are able to bring computation to the data and share how they obtain their scientific results, a key step toward reproducible science.  Users will have the option of downloading notebooks and associated data to their own platforms or executing them on San Diego Supercomputer Center and NCSA high performance platforms."
