The award is co-funded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials Research.  Simulations based on Quantum Mechanics are accurate, versatile and vital to molecular and materials discovery. Unfortunately, for many real-world systems, they are also painstakingly slow.  Thus, scientists are often limited to studying idealized systems at small scales. Ramprasad and Song are utilizing Artificial Intelligence approaches to develop a new, transformative capability that observes, distills and learns the behavior of the Quantum Mechanical equations and notions of chemical (dis)similarity. Their new ""Machine Learning"" capability is able to emulate Quantum Mechanical simulations, but at unprecedented speed-ups of over eight orders of magnitude while still preserving accuracy. This capability progressively improves in quality as it is periodically (or on-demand) exposed to fresh data on new chemistries and molecular configurations in regions of poor knowledge. In other words, the simulation capability can systematically and continuously improve with experience. Several problems currently beyond the reaches of traditional simulation methods may  become solvable. Through their research, pedagogical and dissemination efforts, Ramprasad and Song are training the next generation of students who will require skills in traditional STEM domains as well as in advanced data analytics.  The project is well-aligned with NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution Big Idea. This effort is also aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) which has propelled efforts to hasten the discovery cycle of new chemicals and materials to satisfy a variety of critical technological needs. <br/><br/><br/>The specific flavor of Quantum Mechanical simulations that Ramprasad and Song are targeting in their work involves solving the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation of density functional theory (DFT). Despite its versatility, routine DFT calculations are usually limited to a few hundred atoms due to the computational bottleneck posed by the KS equation. The Machine Learning based DFT-emulation scheme that Ramprasad and Song are developing assimilates the function of the KS equation efficiently using past example reference DFT calculations.  Once trained, the scheme by-passes the KS equation entirely for future calculations, to directly, rapidly and accurately predict the electronic structure of a molecule or material, given just its atomic configuration. Novel rotationally invariant graph neural network representations are being utilized to map the atomic environment around a grid point to the electron density and local electronic density of states at that grid point. This mapping is learned using a deep neural network trained on initial reference DFT results at millions of grid points. Subsequently emerging new data will be absorbed into the neural networks via multi-task learning and transfer learning. The paradigm allows for the high-fidelity emulation of KS DFT, but orders of magnitude faster than the direct solution; indeed, the machine learning prediction scheme is strictly linear-scaling with system size. This capability is being aimed at systems involving C, H, O and N, which encompasses a large chemical space of technologically important polymers and molecules. The vision is to enable a capability to efficiently design molecules and polymers with a target electronic structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This lack of interpretability represents a fundamental barrier to the adoption of machine learning technologies in some areas, such as health care, where transparency is key. Researchers have long relied on decision trees as a means of interpretable machine learning. In this approach, one develops a series of yes/no questions that eventually lead to a particular action being taken. While appealing in their simplicity, researchers have generally accepted that this approach will perform more poorly than more complex (but less interpretable) approaches. This project will establish that this need not be the case. A new approach to creating decision trees will be developed, which has a strong theoretical basis and performance competitive with less interpretable algorithms that are considered state-of-the-art. Software to implement the new approach will be developed and made freely available. The developed methods will be applied to ongoing studies of preventive vaccines and are poised to have broad impacts by providing personalized recommendations for vaccination. The project will also support graduate students and develop pedagogical material pertaining to ethical issues arising in machine learning in public health and clinical care. <br/><br/>The typical process for building a decision tree involves recursively partitioning the feature space using a greedy search. While this approach conveniently yields a decision tree, it is generally accepted to have worse performance when compared to other tree-based strategies, such as random forests or boosted trees. The project seeks to develop an alternative approach, where the feature space is partitioned using a method based on penalization called the highly adaptive lasso. The resultant prediction function enjoys desirable theoretical properties, but is not immediately representable as a decision tree, as it relies on non-recursive partitioning of the feature space. The first aim of the project will develop strategies for optimally representing a given partitioning via a recursive partitioning, thereby allowing a decision tree representation. A novel application of deep learning will be used to learn an optimal strategy for this representation, leveraging this archetypal uninterpretable algorithm to generate interpretable machine learning. In the second aim of the project, the approach will be extended to the context of personalized medicine and optimal decision trees for assigning treatments will be developed. The developments will have broad impacts on the theory of causal inference and robust machine learning. In the final aim, the developed methods will be applied to several contemporary trials of preventive vaccines to develop personalized vaccination recommendations. In particular, the methods will be applied to help determine optimal dosing strategies for a preventive malaria vaccine in children, which could have broad impacts on informing future vaccination strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research work will extend the theory on the statistical properties of potentially fully neural network models to some other neural network models under different structures, such as the convolutional neural networks, to explore the relation between the inferential property and the neural network architecture. The project is to derive the theoretical guarantees of statistical estimators that are based on nonconvex optimization in more general settings. The PI will explore the possibility to carrying out similar analysis in neural network-based models. Statistical model selection can be utilized in identification of partial differential equations. The project is to establish the corresponding statistical theory and uncover the related practical implication.  A set of open-source software products along with related documentation will be generated, to make our work conveniently reproducible.

In machine learning, the well-known curse of dimensionality implies that, in order to achieve a fixed accuracy in prediction, a large number of training data is required. In image and signal recovery, a large number of measurements are needed to recover a high-dimensional vector, unless further assumptions are made. Fortunately, many real-world data sets exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures due to rich local regularities, global symmetries, repetitive patterns, or redundant sampling. The PI will explore low-dimensional geometric structures in data sets for feature extraction, data prediction and signal recovery. Dimension reduction and function approximation given a set of training data are of central interest in machine learning and data science. When data are concentrated near a low-dimensional set or the function has low complexity, the PI will develop new and fast machine learning algorithms whose performance depends on the complexity of the data or the function, instead of the dimension of the data sets.  In image and signal recovery, an interesting problem is to recover a high-dimensional, sparse vector from a small number of structured measurements. This problem is challenging since sensing matrices arising from imaging and signal processing are often deterministic, structured and highly coherent (some columns are highly correlated), which does not allow one to apply standard theory and algorithms. The PI will utilize the structures of sensing matrices, develop efficient algorithms, and prove performance guarantees. The theory and fast algorithms developed in this project can be applied to a wide range of problems in data compression, image analysis, computer vision, and signal recovery.<br/> <br/> <br/>High dimensional data arise in many fields of contemporary science and introduce new challenges. Fortunately, many real-world data sets exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures. This project focuses on exploiting these low-dimensional geometric structures of the data sets, and developing novel methods for dimension reduction, function approximation, and signal recovery. The PI will work on two sets of problems. In the first one, a data set is modeled as point clouds in a D-dimensional space but concentrating near a d-dimensional manifold, where d is much smaller than D. She plans to exploit the geometric structures of the data sets to build low-dimensional representations of data and approximate functions on data. Function approximations in Euclidean spaces have been well studied; however, classical estimators converge to the true function extremely slowly in high dimensions. When data are concentrated near a d-dimensional manifold, or the function has low complexity, the PI aims at constructing estimators that converge to the true function at a faster rate depending on the intrinsic dimension d. The proposed approach is based on the PI's recent work on adaptive geometric approximations for intrinsically low-dimensional data, where a data-driven, fast and robust scheme was developed to construct low-dimensional geometric approximations of data. The second set of problems arise from imaging and signal processing where the goal is to recover a high-dimensional, sparse vector from its noisy low-frequency Fourier coefficients. It is related with super-resolution in imaging, as the missing high-frequency Fourier coefficients correspond to the high-resolution components of the vector. Many existing methods fail since some columns in the sensing matrix are highly correlated. The PI will utilize the structure of the sensing matrix, develop efficient algorithms and prove performance guarantees. A mathematical theory will be developed to explain the fundamental difficulty of super-resolution, as well as the resolution limit of superior subspace methods, such as MUSIC, ESPRIT, and the matrix pencil method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deep learning uses multiple layers of linear transformations followed by nonlinear activations to represent abstractions in the data.  It is a common belief that deep neural networks are good at learning various geometric structures hidden in data sets, such as rich local regularities, global symmetries, or repetitive patterns. However, little theory has been established to explain the power of deep neural networks for analyzing complex data sets containing geometric structures. This project will develop the theoretical and computational foundations to better understand how deep neural networks exploit geometric structures in data sets and achieve outstanding performance. The results will provide new insights on developing new deep learning models and methodologies.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three sets of related but distinct problems. The first set focuses on efficient approximation of functions on low-dimensional manifolds using deep neural networks. Existing theories show that deep learning estimators converge to the true function extremely slowly in high dimensions. When the function is supported on a low dimensional manifold, the PIs plan to prove a fast convergence rate depending on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. This project will make contributions in function approximation theory, error analysis in statistical regression and classification, and adaptive theory of deep learning. The second set of problems concerns estimation of probability distributions supported on a low-dimensional manifold by deep generative models. These models utilize two neural networks to minimize the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) between the estimator and the data distribution, over the class of distributions generated by a deep generator network. The function class in IPM is realized by a deep discriminator network. This project will design proper network architectures of the generator and the discriminator, and prove performance guarantees of deep generative models. The third set of problems will focus on efficiently computing the optimal transport between two probability distributions using deep neural networks. After reformulating the optimal transport problem as a min-max optimization problem parametrized by two neural networks, the PIs propose a primal dual stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In signal processing, those tasks are called de-mixing, which is very challenging, especially when the signals are mixed in a time-varying manner (non-stationary), or when they are not simply added together (nonlinear). The standard methods, such as the algorithms based on classical Fourier analysis or wavelets, can work effectively for linear and stationary signals, but are not as satisfactory for nonlinear or non-stationary signals. Developing algorithms that can handle such signals becomes a timely task that inspires a wave of research in recent years. A new method, named adaptive local iterative filtering (ALIF) is proposed in this project. ALIF can decompose a non-stationary and nonlinear signal into finitely many components, each of which is called an intrinsic mode function (IMF) that reflects the local property at a certain frequency. ALIF is a nonlinear process that can be adaptive according to the input signals, and can separate different local features (frequencies) automatically.  ALIF will also be used together with a machine learning method called factorization machine (FM) to develop a novel signal prediction strategy. It is expected that the ALIF and its prediction algorithms can be used in various applications such as chemical and biological threat detections, ionospheric radio power scintillation in geophysics, data classification and prediction in social media, and financial data analysis.<br/><br/>Nonlinear and non-stationary signals are ubiquitous in real world applications, and they often cannot be handled effectively by the standard algorithms based on Fourier/wavelet transforms, due to the non-linearity and/or their time-varying nature. To capture features, especially the hidden ones, in these signals, it is necessary for the analysis methods to be local, adaptive and stable. The focus of this project has two parts: 1) designing data adaptive algorithms that involve techniques such as iterative filtering for the time frequency analysis; and 2) developing prediction strategies using adaptive iterative filtering techniques in conjunction with the neural networks on nonlinear and non-stationary signals. In the first part, an adaptive local iterative filtering (ALIF) is designed to decompose nonlinear and non-stationary signals, without knowing its instantaneous frequency information in advance. Accompanied with ALIF is a new way, based on dynamical system concepts, to calculate the instantaneous frequencies for decomposed signals. The second part of the project is on a feature prediction strategy, using ALIF together with the factorization machine from neural networks, to learn and predict useful features from noisy signals. In both parts, the mathematical properties, such as convergence and stability of the proposed algorithms, are at the center of studies along with various applications including chemical and biological threat detection, ionospheric radio power scintillation in geophysics, and financial data analysis. The research topic contains a wide range of problems that can be used as projects suitable for undergraduate and graduate education, and postdoctoral scholar training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their use in practice depends on their reliability and efficiency. Reliability requires a fine-tuning of the model parameters and an accurate assessment of the sensitivity to noisy inputs. Efficiency is particularly critical in optimization problems, where the computational procedure identifies the best working conditions of a complex system.  These requirements lead to solving many times models with millions or even billions of unknowns. This process may require days or weeks of computations on high-performance computing facilities. To mitigate these costs, we need new modeling strategies that allow model-runs in minutes to hours on local computing facilities (such as a laptop).  Reduced order models (ROMs) are extremely low-dimensional approximations that can decrease the computational cost of current computational models by orders of magnitude. Having in mind biomedical and wind-engineering applications, this project proposes novel methods of model reduction. Data and numerical results from the expensive (or high-fidelity) models are combined with machine learning approaches, to obtain ROMs that attain both efficiency and accuracy at an unprecedented level. The new data-driven ROM framework will finally make possible the numerical simulation of aortic dissections, pediatric surgery, or wind farm optimization on a laptop in minutes, and aims at becoming a critical and trustworthy tool in decision-making processes.<br/><br/>Data assimilation (DA), uncertainty quantification (UQ), and shape optimization (SO) are central to the development of computational models for significant biomedical and engineering applications.   Since these applications require a large number of model simulations, running an expensive full order model (FOM) is generally prohibitively expensive.  For systems that display dominant structures, reduced order models (ROMs) can decrease the FOM computational cost by orders of magnitude.   Thus, for the clinical and engineering applications above, ROMs appear as a natural and practical alternative to the prohibitively expensive FOMs running on high-performance computing facilities.   Unfortunately, to capture all the geometric scales in the hemodynamics of aortic dissections or to cope with the large Reynolds number in the wind farm optimization, hundreds and thousands of ROM modes are necessary. These relatively high-dimensional ROMs are still not viable to effectively perform DA, UQ, or SO for these applications.  What is needed is ROMs that are not only low-dimensional and efficient, but also accurate.  To develop ROMs that are accurate in realistic, under-resolved regimes, the ROM closure problem needs to be solved, i.e., the effect of the discarded ROM modes on the ROM dynamics needs to be modeled.  The proposed research puts forth a new data-driven ROM paradigm that centers around the hierarchical structure of variational multiscale (VMS) methodology and utilizes modern machine learning (ML) and numerical and observational data to develop structural ROM closures that can dramatically increase the ROM accuracy at a modest computational cost.  The novel data-driven VMS-ROM paradigm maintains the low computational cost of current ROMs but dramatically increases the ROM accuracy.  Biomedical applications in thoracic and pediatric surgery (aortic dissections and Fontan procedure ? where the fate of the patient depends significantly on the shape of the vessels) as well as wind-engineering applications are specifically targeted. The data-driven VMS-ROM framework will finally make possible the efficient DA, UQ, and SO in these and, possibly, other fields relying on mathematical and computational modeling.

This work takes fundamental understanding of functional solids in a new direction and also opens opportunities for new technologies. The materials under study can potentially trap large amounts of gas at room temperature and pressure, and then release the gas on warming. For a given volume, they can contain more gas than the high pressure storage tanks typically used to contain hydrogen, helium and other industrially important gases. Efficient and safe gas storage is one of the major barriers to using hydrogen as a fuel. The new gas-containing materials also have potential for gas separation and purification processes that are of importance to the nuclear industry and national defense. Computer simulations, which make use of a machine learning approach, support and guide the experimental work. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in a variety of techniques that are of wide utility in the development of new functional materials is integrated into the project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research. <br/><br/>Parts 2: Technical Summary<br/>This project explores the preparation and properties of perovskites where a small gas molecule or atom, for example molecular hydrogen, neon or helium, is a structural component of the material. While there is vast body of prior work on perovskites, due to their technological significance across a wide range of applications, there is almost nothing known about gas-containing perovskites. Materials of this type can contain the gas at much higher densities than found in conventional high pressure gas storage tanks, and the small pores within their structures may enable isotope separation by quantum sieving effects.  Synthetic approaches include three distinct strategies for preparing new materials in different compositional families.  High pressure diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, along with gas release measurements from recovered samples, provide information on the formation and properties of the materials.  In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, experiment is complemented by advanced computational tools, so that computation both explains experimental results and guides the preparation of new materials. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, based on force fields derived from density functional theory calculations using a deep-learning convolution neural network approach, provide an opportunity to realistically capture the behavior of the materials. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in a variety of synthetic, computational and materials characterization techniques is integrated into the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a scenario where direct measurements of the unknown quantities are not feasible, and one needs to identify ""cause from effect"" by using (generally nonlinear) mathematical and statistical models. The resulting problems are notoriously ill-posed (or unstable), in a sense that even small measurement errors in the input data may give rise to a substantial noise propagation in the recovered solution, to the extent that this solution gets entirely destroyed. For this reason, special techniques called ""regularization"" must be combined with high-speed optimization procedures, so that reliable information on the unknown effect could be obtained from the available data. The key areas of application include imaging and sensing technology, machine learning, gravitational sounding, ocean acoustics, and data sciences.<br/><br/>This project aims at the development of iteratively regularized Broyden-type numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems in either finite or infinite dimensional spaces. A family of new regularization methods will be designed to solve large-scale unstable least squares problems, where the Jacobian of a discretized nonlinear operator is difficult or even impossible to compute. To overcome this obstacle, PIs consider a family of Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms with the Frechet derivative operator recalculated recursively by using Broyden-type single rank updates. To balance accuracy and stability, the pseudo-inverse for the derivative-free Jacobian is regularized in a problem-specific manner at every step of the iteration process. A variety of filters will be investigated, yielding greater flexibility in the use of qualitative and quantitative a priori information available for each particular applied problem. The proposed iteratively regularized methods will be studied in both deterministic and stochastic settings. For stochastic processes, the minimization functionals are evaluated subject to stochastic errors due to inexact computations to lower per-iteration cost, and/or unavoidable environmental noise and fluctuations. In the framework of the proposed research, PIs will conduct comprehensive convergence analysis of the new algorithms, including convergence rates and optimal policies for the selection of regularization parameters and step sizes. In addition to the theoretical investigation, a significant component of this project is to evaluate the proposed algorithms using extensive numerical experiments on real-world nonlinear inverse problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimal error rates in such estimation problems are often rather slow due to the ``curse of dimensionality"", and it becomes increasingly important to identify low-dimensional structures and features of high-dimensional parameters that could be estimated efficiently with error rates common in classical, ``low-dimensional"" statistics. Such features are often represented by functionals that depend smoothly of unknown parameters and the goal is to take advantage of their smoothness to develop efficient estimation procedures. The problems of this nature often occur in a variety of applications such as signal and image processing, machine learning and data analytics.  The purpose of this project is to study these problems systematically and to develop new approaches to efficient estimation of smooth functionals. The project is in an interdisciplinary area between mathematics, statistics and computer science and it includes a number of activities to facilitate interactions with researchers in these areas and to ensure the impact of proposed research on education. <br/><br/>The main focus of the project is on the development of general methods of estimation of smooth functionals of covariance operators based on high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional observations. It is expected that these methods will be applicable to other important high-dimensional  models such as Gaussian shift models (both in vector and in matrix case); linear regression models (including trace regression and regression models in quantum state tomography); some non-linear models. The methods to be developed include a new approach to bias reduction in smooth functional estimation problems based on iterative application of bootstrap (bootstrap chains) and concentration and normal approximation bounds needed to establish asymptotic efficiency of estimators with reduced bias. The goal is to determine optimal smoothness thresholds for functionals of interest that ensure their efficient estimation, in particular, in a dimension free high-complexity setting, with complexity of the problem characterized by the effective rank of the true covariance. Other directions include the study of efficient estimation of smooth functionals under regularity assumptions on the parameter set and applications of methods of functional estimation to hypotheses testing for high-dimensional parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past two decades, practical applications of sampling have proliferated in areas such as statistics, networking, biology, differential privacy, and, most notably, machine learning. Sampling is used to evaluate models, as a subroutine for optimization, and more generally for exploring large complex spaces. In these practical settings, the time complexity of sampling is a severe limitation; known methods often require either restricting sampling to very small instances or resorting to unproven heuristics or overly restrictive assumptions. This project will develop a toolkit for sampling and evaluate it on real data sets --- a large-scale, high-dimensional toolkit for sampling smooth and non-smooth distributions, and a suite of functions that can be computed or estimated using access to samples. It will be developed working together with domain experts in health metrics and systems biology.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to produce a general-purpose, open-source, and publicly accessible software for sampling non-smooth log-concave distributions with millions of variables. Achieving these goals requires overcoming complex challenges in both theory and implementation. The new algorithms will be inspired by the investigators' expertise in convex optimization, high dimensional geometry, and randomized linear algebra, especially their breakthroughs in linear programming and volume computation. In both target application domains, health metrics and systems biology, the investigators have worked with experts to develop the current state-of-the-art software tools and deployed them.

Activity changes in these circuits contribute to the abnormalities seen in movement disorders such Parkinson?s disease. While activity changes in the basal ganglia are well defined, little is known about parkinsonism-associated changes in the primate basal ganglia-connected motor thalamus and cortex. To understand these changes in humans it is important to study the circuit dysfunction in primates, as these neuronal regions differ in both connections and composition from other species such as rodents. This project aims to enhance understanding of these network dynamics in ways that cannot be accomplished with conventional modeling approaches that often use an unwieldy number of coupled equations. Once the dynamics are described, new treatment approaches directed at normalizing thalamic activity in parkinsonian subjects may be developed and optimized for safety and effectiveness.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of brain circuits are helpful to understand these abnormalities within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network of connections. This project will generate a new multiscale model of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways that will reflect the nonlinear nature of individual neurons while taking advantage of the inherent features of each nucleus. The first objective will be to create a fully functional thalamocortical loop model that can locate and examine the bifurcations between healthy and diseased brain activity states. Of particular interest are the trajectories in parameter space that could allow a parkinsonian subject to return back to the stable healthy state, allowing possibilities for researchers to identify new therapeutic opportunities. Next, since the primate-specific thalamic interneurons cannot currently be targeted with certainty in vivo, the model will be used to examine the roles that these interneurons have on the system. Finally, the model will be validated using an extensive dataset of neuronal recordings from healthy and parkinsonian nonhuman primates. Comparison to the recorded data will restrict the analysis of the mathematical model to a physiologically plausible region of the parameter space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern machines, which include force-generating motors, enabled the industrial revolution and are foundational to human civilization. Miniature micromachines are used in countless devices including cell phone microphones, implantable biosensors, and airplane accelerometers. Further miniaturization to the nanometer scale would enable the design of machines that can manipulate biomolecules and other nanomaterials for applications in medicine, biological research, and material development. Such machines are typically difficult to build because of their small size. However, a recent boom in the field of DNA origami, where DNA is folded into precise three-dimensional structures, now provides the ability to build and test the properties of virtually any three-dimensional structure. In this proposal, the team will study nanoscale DNA machines and investigate the design rules to enhance the speed and endurance of these motors. The potential impact of the project could be in developing more efficient nanoscale motors that have applications such as sensing, computation, and drug delivery systems. This project will integrate research efforts with outreach activities designed to advance the public understanding of nanoscale machines. Educational activities include K-12 outreach to recruit underrepresented students into STEM fields. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this project is to investigate the properties of dynamic force generating DNA nanomachines. Biological motor proteins dynamically alter their interaction with a track through ATP hydrolysis-fueled conformational changes and display directional motion over distances of many microns at micrometer/sec speeds. Recapitulating these functions in synthetic materials is a fundamentally challenging problem that holds the potential to impact several fields. This includes the next generation of synthetic muscles, drug delivery systems, and sensors. Accordingly, the fundamental question driving this proposal is whether it is possible to create artificial molecular motors capable of translocating directionally at high velocities and over long distances. To date, the most promising synthetic motor systems involve DNA-based machines, owing to their predictable and tunable Watson-Crick base pairing. The lab of the PI has discovered a new class of synthetic DNA-based motors that move at a speed that is 1000 times faster than the state-of-the-art. Because the mechanism of motor transport depends on Watson-Crick base-pairing and catalytic hydrolysis of RNA, these motors can be potentially miniaturized to the nanometer length scale. Preliminary experiments support this hypothesis. The project will specifically test the mechanism of how DNA nanomotors dynamically translocate across a surface. This will require the integration of DNA origami assembly coupled with single molecule fluorescence imaging techniques. The research, education, and outreach efforts will be integrated though their emphasis on developing studying dynamic force-generating biomaterials.

The difference between these two sets of laws is what can lend tremendous power to quantum technologies, ranging from quantum computers that promise unparalleled computational speed, to new quantum mechanical sensors that herald improved measurement technologies.  Today there is an increased need for understanding the science that enables such quantum machinery, and to discover the physical laws and limitations relevant to the quantum world.  This team will use an ultracold atomic gas to advance such scientific understanding.  By cooling gases very close to absolute zero, this team will realize a nearly pure quantum system known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), with which they can explore the limits to pure quantum behavior.  One aim of this project is to control the magnetic properties of a BEC using magnetic fields to generate artificial instabilities and to use these instabilities to learn how a quantum system heats up and loses its pure quantum nature, and how one might be able to control that process.

CO2 is the inevitable oxidation product of the primary fossil fuel energy vectors of modern society and reducing it back to useful hydrocarbon products such as formate is desirable for both environmental and economic reasons. It is difficult to activate CO2 towards reduction, however, because it is a very stable molecule, both thermodynamically and kinetically. New catalysts and a method for coupling them to a renewable energy source are required to achieve this goal. Man-made materials such as metal oxide surfaces are inefficient catalysts and suffer from lack of specificity for CO2 substrate over H+ and the interfering hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast, nature has evolved highly efficient catalysts for selective CO2 reduction without competitive H2 evolution. Formate dehydrogenases (FDH), are a class of enzymes from prokaryotes that reversibly catalyze the reduction of CO2 to formate, a precursor to methanol or methane production and a potential energy source itself. In nature, however, FDH enzymes are not naturally activated by light, but require some other input of energy. The Dyer group will develop hybrid biotic/abiotic materials that integrate a nanocrystalline semiconductor (quantum dot) with the FDH enzyme to achieve light driven CO2 reduction. Biotic/abiotic interfaces have evolved in nature to achieve functional designs that range from biofilms to photonic crystals and structural materials. Artificial hybrid abiotic/biotic materials may be rationally designed to achieve novel and emergent functions.  Integrating biomolecular and abiotic structures is a powerful approach to create functional materials. The major goal of this work is to couple the biological enzyme FDH to an abiotic photosensitizer component (quantum dot) that converts solar energy into reactive electrons, to produce functional materials that can be optimized for highly efficient light driven conversion of CO2 to fuel.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The central goal of this grant is to develop hybrid biotic/abiotic functional materials based on a formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme coupled to a nanocrystalline semiconductor (NCS) photosensitizer for light driven, multi-electron reduction of CO2 to formate. The first objective is to design, synthesize and characterize hybrid NCS:FDH materials that convert light to reactive electrons and then efficiently transfer them to the catalyst. The interfacial electron transfer (ET) will be optimized by controlling the NCS:FDH interaction using three different approaches: 1) direct attachment to the NCS surface via an N-terminal His-tag; 2) optimization of ET efficiency using a viologen derivative redox mediator and 3) a covalent ""molecular wire"" to the distal FeS cluster. Interfacial ET will also be optimized by wave-function engineering of the NCS structure (dot, core shell, rod, dot-in-rod structures) and the nature of the capping ligands and interfacial charge. Finally, the efficiency of light-driven CO2 reduction will be correlated to the interfacial ET efficiency and to the underlying structure of the hybrid interface. The second objective of the grant is to elucidate the mechanism of light driven CO2 reduction by hybrid NCS:FDH materials. The intrinsic photosensitivity of these hybrid materials will be exploited to optically trigger the ET and enzyme turnover and thereby study the dynamics of all of the relevant processes, including multi-exciton generation and extraction, interfacial electron transfer and enzyme turnover. These experiments will test the important hypothesis that a quantum confined NCS may act as a multi-electron photosensitizer by multi-exciton generation and extraction. This approach will also be used to elucidate the CO2 reduction mechanism by the FDH enzymes. The Dyer lab has developed a unique capability for this purpose, based on the laser induced potential jump coupled with structure-specific, time-resolved methods including ultrafast infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally, these materials will be integrated into photo-electrodes to demonstrate sustained light-driven CO2 reduction without the limitations imposed by the use of a sacrificial electron donor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nucleic acids provide exceptionally information-rich architectures, and this capability can be harnessed for a variety of applications in biotechnology.  However, the molecules typically used in these applications are not suitable for use in biological environments, as they are rapidly degraded by enzymes. This proposal will explore non-natural nucleic acids that are not degraded in biological environments.  Importantly, these nucleic acids can also be functionalized to impart a diverse range of chemical properties.  In the proposed research, the modulation of these properties will be explored to control formation and disruption of nanoscale assemblies, which is anticipated to enable controlled binding and release of small guest molecules such as therapeutics.  This research project will span the fields of materials science, chemistry, and molecular biology, providing undergraduate and graduate students with a highly interdisciplinary training experience involving the use of cutting edge techniques.  This project will also contribute to public scientific literacy through a blog project implemented in a course taught by the PI, as well as through the PI's participation as a judge and student mentor for the high school International Science Fair.<br/><br/>Technical: This research project will explore amphiphilic peptide nucleic acids (PNA) as a new class of programmable materials capable of stimuli-responsive assembly, disassembly, and guest release.  PNA is an artificial nucleic acid having unique physicochemical properties, which can largely be attributed to the fact that it has an achiral, peptide-like backbone in place of the sugar-phosphate backbone found in native nucleic acids.  Specifically, PNA is not degraded by nucleases or proteases, and exhibits increased binding affinity with DNA and RNA.  Additionally, PNA can be synthesized having a functionally diverse array of side chains located at sequence-defined positions along the backbone.  <br/><br/>Synthesis and exploration of amphiphilic PNA strands in which side chains are strategically located to enable phase-driven self-assembly into micellar architectures will be studied.  Specifically, the project will (1) establish design rules for the assembly and guest binding properties of amphiphilic PNA sequences; (2) evaluate disassembly and guest release from PNA micelles in response to small-molecule and nucleic acid targets; (3) explore stimuli-responsive assembly of PNA amphiphiles to promote small-molecule release.

Bimetallic nanocrystals, made of two different metal species, have properties that are often superior to their single-metal counterparts. The arrangement of the two different metals relative to each other in the nanocrystal is very important in determining the nanocrystal properties, and considerable effort has been made to deposit one metal atop the nanocrystal surface of another metal with precision in location.  It remains a grand challenge to detect and quantify the metal being deposited, particularly when the nanocrystals are still suspended in the reaction medium undergoing growth. Dr. Dong Qin addresses this challenge by developing a class of molecules, the isocyanides (molecules containing the -NC chemical group), as probes for in situ characterization with detection of the isocyanides by a spectroscopic technique, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The ultimate goal is to establish a scientific basis for enabling the rational synthesis of bimetallic nanocrystals with well-controlled compositions and shapes, which have broader societal impact through their need in a variety of applications. This research project encompasses multiple disciplines such as materials science, chemistry, colloidal science, solid-state physics, photonics, and surface science, with a focus on the following components for student development: i)  active learning in interdisciplinary areas involved in understanding the structure and property relationships of nanomaterials; ii) training that provides hands-on experience in the synthesis of nanomaterials in the Qin laboratory, and on the characterization of nanomaterials in the state-of-the-art facilities at Georgia Tech and national laboratories; and iii) exposing the community and society, including high school students and teachers, to nanoscale science and technology concepts.<br/><br/>In this research, Dr. Dong Qin from the Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to study the fundamentals involved in the heterogeneous nucleation and overgrowth of bimetallic nanocrystals. Specifically, a novel class of isocyanide-based molecular probes (R-NC) are developed for in situ detection and analysis of the overgrowth of a second noble metal (M: Pd, Pt, Ir, Rh, or Ru) on Ag nanocrystals suspended in the original growth solution by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Because the binding of the isocyanide group to a metal surface is similar to that of carbon monoxide, it is anticipated that the stretching frequency of the NC bond differs when the isocyanide group binds to the Ag and M atoms, respectively. Therefore, it is feasible to monitor the M atoms being deposited onto Ag nanocrystals by following the stretching frequencies and intensities of NC vibration in real time. On the other hand, the SERS hot spots on the Ag nanocrystals can be designed to coincide with the sites favored by M atoms for heterogeneous nucleation, allowing for unprecedented sensitivity with a detection limit below one monolayer. By leveraging their consummate sensitivity toward metal atoms, the novel SERS probes open up new opportunities to elucidate the mechanistic details involved in the seeded overgrowth of a second noble metal on the surface of Ag nanocrystals. The mechanistic insights support the rational design and knowledge-based synthesis of bi- and multi-metallic nanocrystals for a variety of applications. This research project encompasses multiple disciplines such as materials science, chemistry, colloidal science, solid-state physics, photonics, and surface science, with a focus on the following components for student development: i)  active learning in interdisciplinary areas involved in understanding the structure and property relationships of nanomaterials; ii) training that provides hands-on experience in the synthesis of nanomaterials in the Qin laboratory, and on the characterization of nanomaterials in the state-of-the-art facilities at Georgia Tech and national laboratories; and iii) exposing the community and society, including high school students and teachers, to nanoscale science and technology concepts."

To do so, they rely on interacting neural and mechanical systems that must operate in the context of the physics of sensing, actuation, and environmental interactions. Modern data acquisition tools provide unprecedented access to the underlying neural, muscular, and mechanical signals that implement control. However, these signals alone are not a framework for understanding how sensory information transforms into motor outputs. This CAREER project leverages several emerging experimental and analytical techniques to show how locomotor dynamics emerge from this sensorimotor transform. This framework for extracting principles of sensorimotor control is based on combining high-resolution neuromuscular recordings, information theoretic and dimensionality-reduction data analytics, and the formal language of system identification and control theory. The experimental framework of this proposal is transferrable to other living and engineered systems composed of many subsystems connected by feedback such as gene or protein networks, cell mechanics, or population dynamics. Principles of locomotor control that emerge from this work will synergize with the BRAIN initiative and similar programs by providing context through which to interpret a deep, detailed understanding of brain structure, anatomy, and connectivity. They will also address challenges in the new era of robotics and neural engineering. There is a pressing need for neuro-technologies that enable versatile movement while embodied in physical systems. More broadly this work will enable translation of research-based undergraduate learning into scientific and education products. It will bring a neuroscience component to the growing Physics of Living Systems curriculum at Georgia Tech. Within the VIP program, students will receive training at the interface of biology, physics, and engineering by engaging in research-based learning that is organized into a vertical mentoring system. Ultimately the study of how brain and body control movement is an accessible context in which to engage the public and further converge education of physics and biology even outside the walls of the research university.<br/><br/>The research uses three experimental platforms (two animals and one robot).

The PI's work also explores the performance consequences of different control architectures and the sensorimotor determinants on maneuverability. The program will use the interdisciplinary study of movement to create a scientific foundry for the Physics of Living Systems at Georgia Tech with an emphasis on how physics approaches provide a context for understanding neural signals. The core of the foundry will be a vertically integrated research team of undergraduates that will complete the loop of research-based education to classroom-inspired research.

This research will probe the relationship between the structure of the stitches and the mechanical properties of knitted textiles.

Textiles are a natural conduit between curvature, topology and everyday life. These innately hierarchical materials have a wealth of emergent geometric and elastic properties, including: soft elasticity at low strain, high extensional rigidity at large strain, low bending modulus, high resistance to global failure, and programmable local curvature. These properties, coupled with cheap, programmable manufacturing techniques make knits prized for industrial and domestic applications. <br/><br/>Each knitted stitch is entangled with its neighbors, creating a locally knotted structure. The topology of these textile ""knots"" creates physical constraints that are responsible for the emergent elasticity of textiles. Previous studies into knitted elasticity have considered only a single type of knitted fabric. However, manipulating the local stitch topology has a profound impact on the elasticity; it can increase or decrease the extensional rigidity, change the crossover between soft elasticity and nonlinear behavior, and even create local topography. <br/><br/>Unlike many coarse-grained physical systems, a satisfactory set of overarching equations that determine the mechanics of textiles is lacking. Understanding the entanglement topology of knitted stitches is key to creating a predictive model of elastic and geometric responses of textiles. This CAREER project will create a framework which unites textile topology with its emergent elasticity. These are broken into two aims: (1) the research team will identify topologically allowed knitted stitches, from which (2) their effect on the local geometry and elasticity of the fabric can be predicted. Techniques from knot theory and 3-manifold topology will be used to create a comprehensive set of stitches. These stitches and their topology will provide the yarn-level basis for an elasticity model. The behavior of each stitch and interactions between stitches will be coarse-grained into a 2D surface model of fabric elasticity. The research team will use anisotropic geometric elasticity theory to relate the local properties of the yarn and the topology of the stitches to the mechanical response of the bulk textile. This framework will be the first set of constitutive relations that govern textile behavior. <br/><br/>This research acts as a conduit between curvature in fabrics and the physics and mathematics of curvature in nature.

The construction of defined structures within the meso-scale range is a problem of significant scientific and technological interest because it is key to the ultimate realization of ""bottom-up"" fabrication. This process employs structurally- and functionally-defined nano-scale building blocks for the creation of meso-scale objects of defined size, composition, pattern, and morphology, which in turn represent ideal platforms for the creation of functional devices including sensors, actuators, and tranducers. However, the physical principles for construction of synthetic materials on the meso-scale are not well developed in practice. In contrast, biological systems, e.g., cells, assemble multiple nano-scale components into exquisitely-defined, functionally-complex meso-scale machines. Researchers in the laboratory of Prof. Vincent Conticello at Emory University are developing principles derived from the study of biological systems to create structurally-homogeneous, meso-scale 2D assemblies from synthetic peptides.  These principles are generalizable to the field of soft materials. The structurally-defined 2D assemblies represent prototypes for the creation of functional devices. Concepts and principles from this project are being utilized in the development of a new course as part of the undergraduate curriculum reform in the Department of Chemistry at Emory University. The reform emphasizes the integration of traditional disciplines into themes using a blended pedagogical approach. The new introductory course focuses on macromolecular structure and function, which is a topic rarely covered at the undergraduate level.<br/><br/>Two-dimensional crystalline or quasi-crystalline protein assemblies present in living systems display a range of essential biochemical functions including as molecular sieves and barrier materials, photochemical energy transducers, selective transporters, and signal transduction and amplification agents. The native protein assemblies provide inspiration for the types of critical functions that could potentially be encoded within synthetic 2D protein arrays, if their structure could be controlled across length-scales. This proposal investigates methods to create structurally-defined and programmable meso-scale 2D assemblies from synthetic peptides. Peptides offer a number of advantages for the controlled fabrication of 2D assemblies; most importantly, the sequence-specificity of peptides makes possible molecular-level programming of hierarchical order and enhances the capacity for rational control of the assembly . However, thus far meso-scale structural control has been fortuitous and, this far extensive structural polymorphism was observed for assemblies of synthetic peptide. Researchers in the Conticello laboratory are defining methods to control the mechanism of assembly and identify conditions that promote meso-scale structural order. Three complementary approaches are being investigated: (1) controlled nucleation of ""living"" supramolecular assemblies, (2) selective formation of heteromeric assemblies, and (3) implementation of principles based on geometrical frustration. Each of these practices has the potential to generate structurally-homogeneous meso-scale 2D peptide assemblies, which in turn serve as structural prototypes for the types of functional 2D materials employed in devices.  Hence this work addresses the opportunity implicit in the ""meso-scale challenge"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The damage attributed to cartilage over time presents a tremendous challenge for millions of Americans, and ultimately fosters the development of osteoarthritis. Given this important need to mitigate the damage to cartilage, it is critical that new therapeutic implantable materials are developed for human joints. In order to discover, understand, and ultimately utilize new biomaterial, fundamental knowledge of the behavior of these materials in a complex mechanical stress and biological environment is required. This award will support graduate and undergraduate training on the preparation and evaluation of new therapeutic materials for cartilage tissue repair and will further our understanding of how they respond under stressed environments that lead to osteoarthritis. Additionally, students at Morehouse College will prepare short films to engage society into learning about biomaterial science while also hosting outreach activities for local Atlanta Public School students. This activity will facilitate the development of a community of learners ranging from K-12, undergraduate, post graduate, to adults. <br/><br/><br/>Technical: <br/>Articular cartilage is a highly ordered avascular connective tissue that lines the articular joints and is known to withstand enormous biomechanical loads having a frictionless surface for optimal mobility. However, articular cartilage is limited in its ability to repair itself after defects from disease or injury. At the onset of injury or disease, hypoxia  (low oxygen) disrupt the avascular architecture giving rise to the presence of reactive oxygen species that prevent healthy articular cartilage cell proliferation throughout the three-dimensional cartilage tissue matrix. Biomaterials that promote healthy 3D cell culture and proliferation under hypoxia are currently not available. The objective of this project focuses on the development of thermo-sensitive therapeutic laden hydrogels and the study of hypoxia on cell viability and hydrogel structure and function prepared from 3D printed bio-inks. This research entails the preparation, characterization, 3D printing, biochemical analysis, and spatial mapping of thermo-responsive therapeutic laden hydrogels that provide a new approach to regenerative tissue engineering. The use of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels to improve cell microenvironments and promote healthy extracellular matrix in 3D culture is of particular interest. The governing hypothesis of this project is driven by formulations of hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels with robust structural integrity, higher oxygen diffusion coefficients, and the structural mimicry of articular cartilage zones via 3D printed bio-inks to provide cellular-protection under hypoxia towards chondrogenesis. Using hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels, the Principal Investigator and research team evaluate how hypoxic induced reactive oxygen species mitigate cell fate, ECM amounts, and effect biomaterial properties. The effect of chemical modifications and the impact of structure and function in hybrid therapeutic hydrogels are noted for improved tissue engineering strategies.

Unfortunately, as the dimensions of ferroelectric materials decrease to a few tens of nanometers, their high dielectric property eventually disappears as a result of destabilization of the ferroelectric phase. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop novel, high dielectric constant ferroelectric nanocrystals with stable ferroelectric phase and nanosized domains. The understanding of polymer defect-induced ferroelectric nanodomains within inorganic nanocrystals paves the way to create many other intriguing ferroelectric nanocrystals. Meanwhile, the research project is integrated with nanoscience education through close interactions among graduate students, undergraduate students, high school science teachers, and high school students in a multilevel learning experience inspired by the excitement of discovery at both Georgia Tech and Case Western Reserve University. The goals are to stimulate the interest of high school students in the area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and better prepare undergraduate students for the STEM-related professions. To enhance the public awareness of nanoscience and nanotechnology, research findings are widely disseminated to multiple constituencies through publications in scientific journals, presentations at national conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This proposal aims to understand the effect of organic/inorganic hybridization on the nanoscopic ferroelectric phase and domain structures in polymer-tethered hybrid BaTiO3 nanocrystals, and extend the underlying mechanism to other lead-free relaxor ferroelectric systems to achieve high dielectric constants for various potential electrical applications. First, novel amphiphilic nonlinear block copolymers are rationally designed and synthesized.

The nanoscale ferroelectric phase and domain structures in polymer-tethered hybrid BaTiO3 nanocrystals are interrogated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the mechanism of their relaxor ferroelectric behavior can be unraveled.

Despite the recent development of new ceramic materials for fast conduction of lithium ions, these battery systems are not yet commercialized. A major outstanding problem is that the solid-state interfaces between the ion-conducting ceramics and other materials within the battery are unstable, which leads to poor battery lifetimes. To address this challenge, this research uses novel experimental techniques to understand interface degradation processes in real time and to determine how to protect these interfaces from degradation. This fundamental understanding is critical for the creation of reliable, long-lasting solid-state batteries. This work is being performed by both graduate and undergraduate students, who are being trained in the science of materials for energy applications. Furthermore, this research includes an educational initiative in which new high school curriculum is being developed in collaboration with a high school teacher. The curriculum is focused on integrating materials and energy sciences in ways that are relevant to high school students' daily lives. These new learning tools will better prepare high school students from underrepresented groups for careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: <br/>Interfacial transformations and instabilities at ceramic electrolyte interfaces in alkali metal-based solid-state batteries often cause increased impedance and reduced cycle life. The goal of this research is to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of structure, chemistry, and morphology at ceramic electrolyte interfaces within solid-state batteries, and to determine how these factors influence the ionic conductivity and stability of ceramic electrolytes. Multiple in situ experimental techniques are being used to probe nanoscale transformations at ceramic electrolyte/alkali metal interfaces before and during battery operation, and the influence of tailored protection layers on interfacial transformations are also being examined. By directly revealing nanoscale transformations at ceramic electrolyte interfaces for the first time, this research is helping to create the scientific foundation for stabilizing critical interfaces in next-generation solid-state batteries, thereby enabling superior new energy storage technologies."

Over cosmic time, some of these massive BHs will come together, forming a massive black hole binary (MBHB), and eventually merge. MBHBs also accrete nearby matter, and this accretion flow has an important impact on the merger itself. A research collaboration between Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Virginia will help to answer the question, what are the properties of accretion flows in the vicinity of coalescing massive black hole binaries? The answer to this question has direct implications for the feasibility of coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescences. Such detections are considered the next observational grand challenge that will provide a more complete understanding of evolution and growth of these massive objects. In anticipation of future detections by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this team of collaborators will investigate the coincident EM and GW signatures of MBHBs immersed in accretion flows. There are three goals of this program that are complementary to the proposed research and enabled by the investigators' roles as scientists and educators. The first is to  promote diversity in STEM through direct participation of women and members of underrepresented groups.

However, the limited methods to control growth and rationally modify the resultant structures of these materials represents a significant impediment to progress in this field. Peptides and proteins are attractive candidates for the construction of these types of 2D materials since the control of sequence potentially permits the control of structure and function across length scales. One complicating factor is that proteins commonly display complex folding pathways, which can often result in limited control over the structure of the final material. An approach is proposed in which structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a vast library of freely available high-resolution protein structures, will be employed as the starting point to create novel classes of protein-based 2D materials. Layered protein structures will be identified in the PDB, in which close contacts are observed within the layer and long contacts are observed between layers. Computational and rational design methods will be used to strengthen interaction within a layer and further weaken or abrogate interactions between layers. Using this approach, one need not explicitly design the structure from first principles, but can instead create nanosheets from proteins that have a demonstrated propensity to form 2D layers. Several classes of materials targets will be investigated that would be useful from the perspective of potential applications in devices, including selectively permeable membranes and polar 2D crystals. These initial studies will validate the computational design approach and provide generally applicable methods to access novel classes of structurally defined 2D materials. Students involved in this project will gain valuable experience in cross-cutting research that enables a vertical consolidation of skill sets, including computational design, synthesis, and advanced methods of high-resolution structural characterization, that will be implemented for the design and fabrication of functional 2D nanomaterials. In addition, material related to the proposed research will be presented as content to illustrate concepts and learning objectives in a newly developed introductory undergraduate lecture course and laboratory experience on macromolecular chemistry at Emory University.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: A heuristic approach is proposed to the design of structurally ordered 2D peptide nanomaterials that leverages the natural diversity of crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDB represents a rich trove of structural information on biomolecules. Many structures comprise layers of biomolecules, i.e., arrangements in which contact areas are more extensive within at least one crystallographically defined plane than between planes. In principle, the lateral interfaces within appropriately chosen crystal structures can be computationally optimized to enhance the cohesive interactions between protomers, while axial interactions are attentuated through weakening or blocking of the lamination of layers. This investigation comprises a proof-of-principle directed toward the hypothesis that crystallographically characterized layered structures can be used as a starting point to engineer and structurally diversify crystalline 2D peptide and protein assemblies through computational optimization of protomer interfaces. The research plan of this proposal encompasses three specific aims in support of the preceding hypothesis. The first two aims focus on the validation of this computationally-driven approach with respect to the design of two specific classes of 2D peptide materials targets that represent potential substrates for high value-added applications, namely open framework (porous) lattices and polar 2D crystals. We anticipate that success in these two aims will experimentally validate the feasibility and scope of this approach with respect to materials design, while simultaneously providing access to novel 2D nanomaterials. In the third specific aim, structural data resulting from the materials generated in specific aims 1 and 2 will be employed as input for additional rounds of computational design in order to create multi-component 2D nanostructures in which the tectons are chemically distinguishable and independently addressable on the nanoscale. In each specific aim, computational methods will be employed initially to optimize the structurally critical interfaces between protomers. Candidate peptides will be synthesized and screened using higher throughput, low-resolution experimental methods. Suitable structures will be subjected to high-resolution structural analysis, primarily using cryo-EM 2D reconstruction with direct electron detection and, when applicable, single-crystal diffraction analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research team controls the behavior of these hot electrons with other optical effects to understand the generation, transport, and decay of electrons. Moreover, the ultrafast behavior of optically induced hot electrons is harnessed for the all-optical control of light. The knowledge gained through this project lays the groundwork at the interface of semiconductors and optics, and leads to new insights into the design and implementation of devices for the detection and processing of light. This research, included with high school and collegiate education, promotes multidisciplinary thinking of the up-and-coming scientists and engineers.

Nowadays, a large volume of such event data dispersed over space and time are becoming increasingly available in a wide variety of applications, such as human activity data, social network data, and crime data. The observations of the discrete events can occur in continuous time and locations, and there can be a complex text description of such events. The discrete event data contain rich correlation and causal information, which can potentially be used to infer the dynamics of the underlying systems and detect threats. The project aims to develop statistical methods to harvest this potential in threat detection using discrete events and address the algorithmic and computational challenges. The developed methods will go beyond the status-quo model estimation by considering more general statistical inference problems such as hypothesis tests and likelihood-based inference. The developed methods are general and can be used for various discrete event data. The project will specifically demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methods on a large-scale crime dataset collected by the Atlanta Police Department. <br/><br/>Recently, point process models have been proven an effective model for capturing the correlation structure in discrete events. While much success has been achieved in estimating the self-exciting spatial-temporal point process models, it remains unclear how one can perform anomaly detection leveraging these models, since (1) detection (which can be cast as hypothesis test) is inherently different from estimation, which involves different kinds of statistics and performance metrics; (2) in various situations, there is a large number of discrete events over broad spatial areas, and the goal is to detect a small cluster of related events, which amounts to ""finding a needle in a haystack"", thus there is a need to develop powerful and computationally efficient statistics; (3) the normal or reference state can be complex and dynamic and methods need to adapt to the slowly time-varying normal state. The project will address these challenges and provide answers to two related fundamental questions: how to detect clusters of correlated events from a large amount of data using the point process model, and how to estimate time-varying background normal pattern. The proposed work will advance the state-of-art for scan statistic research and build a novel connection between pseudo-likelihood estimation and reinforcement learning.

Water (H2O) is an example of a hydrogen bonded system.  When hydrogen (H) atoms bond to oxygen (O) atoms, the H atom becomes partly positively charged, and the O atom partly negatively charged.  In liquid water, the H2O molecules therefore tend to stick to each other because of the positive-negative attraction between H and O on different H2O molecules.  Hydrogen bonding is actually a general feature of many molecules that contain O-H, or N-H (N= nitrogen) bonds as part of their structure.  Hydrogen bonding is an important topic of research because it can cause the formation of large networks of molecules and influence the rates and outcome of chemical reactions.  The effects of hydrogen bonding are not easy to predict, especially when many atoms and molecules are involved.  Professor Kaledin has developed advanced computer models to simulate the behavior and properties of hydrogen bonded systems.  She and her students are using high-performance computer systems (IBM HPC computer at KSU) are employed to predict the structure of hydrogen bonded systems as well as their response to light energy.  Experimental chemists use what are called spectroscopic techniques to measure how light of different wavelengths (ultraviolet, visible, infrared) are absorbed by molecular systems.  Prof. Kaledin is using computational approaches to predict experimental ""spectra,"" which in turn helps experimental scientists understand their observations.   The findings of this project are contributing to developing molecular dynamics simulation models which advance our understanding of many chemical systems, as well s complex biological systems. The researchers involved in this project include both undergraduate and graduate students. They are learning principles of supercomputing, molecular modeling, supercomputing, interpretation of vibrational spectra, analyzing the energetics of chemical reactions, and molecular visualization techniques. Prof. Kaledin is also Integrating elements of this research project into her formal undergraduate courses, with the aim to improve science education and STEM students success.<br/><br/>Central to these tasks is to calculate and assign vibrational spectra using driven molecular dynamics (DMD). In the DMD method, an external sinusoidal electric field, representing a continuous wave (CW) laser pulse, is used to scan the spectrum for resonances and obtain an absorption profile. The strength of the external field determines the intensity of the motion. The important feature of DMD is the ability to study the anharmonic motion and mode coupling, and make assignments. At resonant frequencies, the molecular motions induced by weak driven force correspond to the normal-mode frequencies, while harder driving induces anharmonic motion. To identify resonant frequencies, the average internal energy of the molecule is obtained after a finite time of driving. DMD is also easily expandable to two-dimensional spectroscopy, such as 2D-IR, an even more powerful tool for studying complex dynamical structures. These techniques provide detailed dynamic information on protonated water clusters and small molecules relevant to atmospheric chemistry, reveal their stability and timescale of motion of individual groups of atoms. The students involved in this project are being trained in molecular dynamics simulations, ab initio and density functional theory calculation,  and interpretation of Raman and infrared spectra (including 2D IR).  All of these tools and skills are highly valuable for scientists entering the modern workforce. In addition to advancing other areas of science through the computational models developed in this project, the broader impacts of this work is includes the promotion of strong  interactions between the research community and industry, and outreach to students from disadvantaged backgrounds or underrepresented groups, for example through engagement with the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The general motivating principle behind the work is that such events, especially when intimately tied to human mobility, generally display robust patterning, such that significant deviations from the typical patterns, either on an individual or collective level, are cause for suspicion and should be treated as potentially dangerous. Thus, this project will better enable authorities to quickly determine when threatening situations arise, so that they can react to them rapidly, mitigating potentially devastating consequences.  To achieve this overarching objective, several sub-objectives will be met: 1) constructing models to integrate disparate datasets on human events at varying levels of granularity, from individual-based to neighborhood-based to region-based; 2) developing a framework that ties this integrated data together with models of human mobility; 3) creating methods for detecting sudden changes within the data given the framework, at varying scales, including individuals, groups of individuals, or spatial regions. <br/><br/>This project will construct a framework for analyzing human spatio-temporal event data arising from heterogeneous sources, based on the mathematics of stochastic point processes, but specifically tailored to represent events whose underlying structure is intimately tied to human mobility. Several ideas will be united in this framework, such that the resulting algorithms are able to identify anomalous behavior or events that may represent ongoing or emerging threats. First, new methods will be explored for pre-processing high frequency human mobility data -- eg., gps trace data -- to reduce dimensionality and better fit within the marked point process framework. Next, new classes of marked point processes will be developed that are better able to handle the detailed geometric structure often underlying spatial human event data, given the regularity of human motion upon which such events are often layered; high-order Hawkes processes geometrically embedding human mobility motifs are proposed specifically for this task. New methods will be developed for clustering data subject to these point processes at varying levels of abstraction and physical relevance, from individuals, to linked social groups, to neighborhoods, in order to better identify geographic regions or subsets of individuals that may be displaying or reacting to anomalous behavior. To go along with this, new ways will be developed to quickly detect anomalies within the data as compared to the expected point process through goodness of fit measures, again at differing levels of clustering; proposed here is a Bayesian method to detect emerging patterns for even very limited datasets using transfer learning. The end result with be a suite of tools that are all individually useful, and that combined will serve as a powerful new method of organizing and analyzing large datasets of human events to detect threatening behavior."

Such understanding is necessary to uncover the history of our Universe and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Many research projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries.  Observations of nearby dwarf galaxies and of very distant galaxies hold clues about the nature of galaxy formation during the first billion years of the Universe, and these first galaxies are being detected by the Hubble Space Telescope and will be further elucidated with the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018.  To accurately interpret and connect these nearby and very distant galaxy observations, precise computer simulations that consider the entire star formation history are essential.  The purpose of this project is to make detailed computer simulations of the formation process of nearby dwarf and distant ultra-diffuse galaxies.  These simulations will track the complete star formation history of dwarf galaxies including their earliest stellar and galactic ancestors.  This project meets the national need to develop US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training students in computational astrophysics, high performance computing, and software engineering, which will enable these students to excel in a competitive job market.  In addition, the investigators' research activities will be integrated into the teaching of astrophysics in K--12 schools and other public venues, such as planetariums, television shows, and online learning environments, where the audience can digest the latest advances in computational astrophysics in a visual and intuitive manner.<br/><br/>More technically, this project has the following goals: (1) to explore formation scenarios for ultra-diffuse galaxies in cluster environments and to determine whether they are related to the formation sequence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies; (2) to construct novel, efficient, and accurate methods for radiation transport; (3) to correlate the high-redshift environment of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution to present-day characteristics---star formation histories, metallicity distribution functions, stellar kinematics, and [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] evolution; and (4) to determine the chemical connection between the first stars and metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies.  This project will  support the development of a hybrid radiation transport solver that incorporates the advantages of both ray tracing methods and moment methods.  This method will be utilized in a suite of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies, following their complete star formation, starting with individual massive metal-free stars.  The simulation data produced during the course of this project, as well as various data products, will be made publicly available through the nascent National Data Service.  These data will be usable by the astrophysical research community and will enable researchers to address a much broader range of questions than this project alone."

By colliding protons with protons at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn more about the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The top quark is the most massive elementary particle that has been discovered, with many unique properties, and thus it is a central part of the physics program at the LHC. The Higgs boson is the particle responsible for generating masses for all of the other elementary particles, and the determination of its properties is a high priority. Professor Kidonakis will improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production, Higgs production, and other processes by performing state-of-the-art calculations. As such, this research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of elementary particles and the search for new physics.  This project is also expected to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Kidonakis will involve students in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  The project will also strengthen physics education and research at Kennesaw State University and the wider region. Professor Kidonakis will also continue to speak at conferences and remain active in outreach activities to the wider community and the public at large.<br/><br/>More technically, the objective of this research project is to develop formalisms that can improve theoretical predictions for cross sections and differential distributions for various processes at the LHC, including top-quark production, Higgs production, and other processes in the Standard Model and in models of new physics. High-order corrections, including collinear and soft-gluon corrections, will be calculated for differential and total cross sections. Resummations will be derived for three-particle final states in various kinematics, thus greatly extending current methods. Theoretical calculations of soft anomalous dimensions will be performed to three-loop accuracy. These calculations are important for precision studies of the top quark, for understanding the Higgs boson and electroweak physics, and for the search for new physics at the LHC. The project will also advance the state-of-the-art in perturbative calculations.  The inclusion of soft and collinear corrections is necessary to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions for LHC physics. Differential distributions, including double-differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity, are very important because they are sensitive to new physics. Resummations for processes with three or more particles in the final state are also needed to improve theoretical predictions, in particular for processes that involve top quarks and Higgs bosons.  The results of the project will therefore be important in making state-of-the-art predictions for various processes, for the interpretation of data from the LHC and the search for new physics, and for understanding the top quark and the Higgs boson.  The results of this research will be widely disseminated through publication in refereed journals and presentations in international conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The capability of enzymes to catalyze chemical transformations can also be harnessed to provide environmentally benign routes for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high-value chemicals. However, naturally occurring enzymes must be honed to function in these non-natural reactions. Key to augmenting enzyme capabilities is the development of fast, high-fidelity sensing tools that measure the function of enzymes in large numbers. With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and partial co-funding from the Biosensing Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems at NSF, Dr. Jennifer Heemstra at Emory University uses a high-speed sequential platform to measure the function of millions of different modified versions of naturally occurring enzymes generated by her team, thereby allowing for identification of those enzymes best suited to important non-natural reactions. This project is developing a user-friendly platform that can be widely applied to discover new enzymes for constructing these high-value chemicals. Integrated with this research, Dr. Heemstra develops and broadly disseminates multi-media resources that help to prepare the future workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Specifically, these resources provide information and advice on professional skills, including oral and written communication, pioneering new research ideas, promoting diversity and inclusion, and professional networking. These resources are freely available to the general public and utilized by students and researchers nationwide.<br/><br/>Dr. Jennifer Heemstra at Emory University is using enantiomeric DNA biosensors to enable high-throughput enantiopurity measurement as a broadly applicable approach to biocatalyst discovery. DNA biosensors are powerful in their ability to transduce the presence of a specific small-molecule target into a dose-dependent fluorescence output. Dr. Heemstra utilizes sensors comprised of each of the two enantiomers of DNA to quantify the concentrations of the two enantiomers of a target small molecule that are produced as a result of an enzymatic reaction. This analysis is integrated with droplet microfluidic technology to enable screening and sorting by flow cytometry. As a result, large libraries of enzyme variants can be rapidly screened, and those having the desired levels of stereoselectivity isolated, thereby accelerating the discovery of new biocatalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high-value chemicals. This research is integrated with an undergraduate curriculum in which students learn how to read and analyze the primary literature and craft original research proposals, as well as publicly available resources to promote the professional development of early-career researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Yuanzhi Tang of the Georgia Institute of Technology investigates the impact of metal impurities on the structure and reactivity of manganese (Mn) oxides. Manganese oxides exist in nearly all environmental settings. They have significant influence on the biogeochemical cycling of metals, nutrients, and organic compounds in these cycles manganese is transferred between living systems and the environment. It also studies the transformation pathways of Mn oxides produced by living organisms under environmentally-relevant conditions. The project includes developing high school curriculum materials that integrate earth and environmental sciences, chemistry, and biology. It promotes the next generation of scientists from underrepresented groups and with different cultural backgrounds and research experiences. Professor Tang and her students develop community outreach activities to showcase mineral and mineral properties to the general public. This task is conducted annually in March during the Atlanta Science Festival, Georgia?s biggest science fair that showcases science and technology<br/>to the general public. Specifically, the research group puts on a ?rock show? where the general public, students, and science educators have the opportunities to learn mineral properties with hands-on demonstrations of parameters such as color, hardness, texture, and chemical alteration. They also develop a kit for the demonstration of biomineralization and mineral-facilitated environmental remediation such as microscope and visual observation of microbial Mn oxidation and color changes during chemical reactions.<br/><br/>Manganese oxides play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of many important nutrients and contaminants. Still, much remains unknown about the influence of ubiquitous metal impurities on the structure, reactivity, and transformation pathways of biogenic Mn oxides. This knowledge is needed to develop accurate predictive models for understanding the fate of contaminants and nutrients in the natural environment. This project systematically examines the changes in biogenic Mn oxide reactivities when they are formed in the presence of common metal ions. The processes of geological and environmental interest include sorption of cations and anions, and abiotic reductive transformation induced by Mn(II). Controlled laboratory studies lead to predictive insight into the relative importance of different metal ions in controlling Mn oxide reactivity."

George Zheng from University of Georgia to investigate novel functions of enzymes called KATs.  Previously the actions of KATs were known to control genes in an on-off fashion. Recent discoveries revealed new biological roles for KATs nearly every place in the cell, beyond the effect on genes. Functions of KATs are far more complex than previously regarded with impacts on multifaceted biological processes, including promoting entirely new chemical reactions.  In this project, the PI designed a series of biochemical and cellular experimental studies to discover and characterize new functions of the major KAT enzymes. A highly multidisciplinary approach is proposed to dissect novel KAT functions. This pursuit is directly related to the PI's efforts in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemical biology and biochemistry. By undertaking these projects, students will learn how to apply advanced technologies to resolve key biological research problems. This project also integrates outreach activities to introduce high school students to the science of enzyme biochemistry. These research-related educational efforts are important to prepare next-generation scientists in chemical and biological sciences.<br/><br/>The research project undertakes the development and application of new chemical biology tools to profile cellular substrates and new functions of the major KAT enzymes, with the goal of significantly advancing protein acylation research. The PI refines and applies a bioorthogonal labeling technology to investigate substrate profiles of the major KATs at the proteomic level. The PI and coworkers also investigate a novel lysine acylation mark in histones and non-histone proteins that they recently discovered. In these experiments, the team identifies enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal of the novel modification mark. The proposed research has great potential to generate new chemical tools for KAT activity investigation, offers a systematic view of KAT substrate distribution in the cell, provides a mechanistic understanding of KAT functions, and to a broader level, advances the knowledge of posttranslational modifications in chromatin remodeling, metabolic pathways, and signal transduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One- and two-dimensional spaces are well-understood, as are dimensions five and above; roughly, in the former, there are not enough dimensions for interesting phenomena, and in the latter, there are so many dimensions that anything interesting has enough room to become uninteresting. Low-dimensional topology focuses on three- and four-dimensions, where many unique phenomena occur. One central question is whether a knotted loop in three-dimensions becomes unknotted when one allows a fourth dimension. One can also ask what happens upon cutting a knot out of space, and then filling in the resulting void in a different way. Knot theory has applications to the very small (e.g., the behavior of knotted strands of DNA) as well as the extremely large (e.g., the shape of the universe). In tandem with the research component, the PI plans to further her mentoring and outreach efforts, for example, by supervising undergraduate and graduate research, and by leading local math events for middle and high school students. She will also organize a workshop for undergraduates to present their research and learn more about careers in mathematics.<br/><br/>Heegaard Floer homology, developed by Ozsvath and Szabo, is a powerful tool for understanding low-dimensional topology. The PI plans to use several recent developments to provide answers to long-standing questions in the field. For example, the recently defined involutive Heegaard Floer homology of Hendricks and Manolescu may have applications to understanding divisibility in the concordance group. In a different direction, the PI plans to study which manifolds arise from surgery on an n-component link, using the link surgery formula of Manolescu and Ozsvath. She also proposes to study homology cobordism, which is closely related to knot concordance, with the hope of providing obstructions to being homology cobordant to surgery on a knot."

Indeed, some proteins contain nickel centers that react with carbon dioxide, which has very strong bonds. Catalysts based on nickel are widely used in energy-related chemistry. The research project led by Professor Joseph P. Sadighi at the Georgia Institute of Technology builds on these themes of strong bonds and energy-relevance. The project focuses on pairs of nickel atoms. The nickel atoms are linked in pairs using bridging atoms or bridging groups. The linkers that are explored in this work include hydrogen, nonmetallic elements, or another metal. The project examines bridging centers that are weakly bonded to each nickel center. These unusually weak bonds should make the complexes sufficiently stable to be isolated, yet unstable enough to be highly reactive. A deeper understanding of these compounds is providing insights into the design of catalysts for breaking strong bonds. The graduate and undergraduate researchers who carry out this research are introduced to concepts of bonding and reactivity, and to an array of synthetic and spectroscopic techniques. The group also participates in a Georgia Tech program to recruit high school students from demographics underrepresented in science.  The students are introduced to research through a summer and then through the academic year. This training prepares students to contribute to the future of science in the United States as teachers, or as researchers in academic, industrial, or government laboratories. The PI has extensive contacts with currently serving or recently transitioned veterans, and provides advice and encouragement to those returning to full-time study.<br/><br/>Nickel has been the subject of remarkable recent advances in metal-element bonding, and in bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions that enable catalysis. This research presents architectures derived from the interaction of two nickel(0) centers with a Lewis acid to form a bridging ligand. When the Lewis acid is a proton, this interaction creates a rare linear hydride bridge; The [Ni---H---Ni]+ core is held together by a three-center, four-electron bond, analogous to that in the bifluoride ion. One aim is the synthesis of a series of related hydride-bridged dinickel complexes, enabling an assessment of the hydridic character of the bridging hydrogen, and a detailed study of the complex's reactivity toward the C-CN bonds of nitriles. Another aim explores the formation of bridges derived from Lewis-acidic main group species such as carbocations, boranes, alanes, or organometallic fragments. Finally, the insertion of copper(I) or gold(I) cations between the nickel centers would afford heterometallic systems with a single net bond across three metal centers. The hypothesis underpinning these aims is that the [Ni---E---Ni] ensembles are sufficiently stable for isolation or characterization, yet display reactivity distinct from that of mononickel complexes [Ni-E], nickel alone, or the bridging element alone. Students who work on this project learn concepts of bonding and chemical synthesis. They acquire technical skills in the preparation of air-sensitive complexes.  They are trained in analysis using modern instrumentation. These researchers include graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. The program identifies underrepresented minority students interested in scientific research.  This training prepares students for technical careers in education, research, and industry.

These workshops aim to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists and groups working on related areas from different points of view, and bring together leading experts and young researchers in these subjects to encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between different fields. This has become increasingly important as these various areas continue to progress deeper. The workshops also allow junior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson Geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field.<br/><br/>Poisson Geometry originates in the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics and the semi-classical limit of quantum mechanics. Poisson structures can be traced back to 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi and Lie. Poisson Geometry as an independent field started around 1980 with the foundational works of Kirillov, Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today the field is developing rapidly, stimulated by the connections with a large number of areas in mathematics and mathematical physics, including differential geometry and Lie theory, quantization, non-commutative geometry, representation theory and quantum groups, geometric mechanics and integrable systems. The ""Gone Fishing"" workshops provide an excellent opportunity for scientists based in North America to exchange ideas and stimulate collaboration.
