This Phase I Center is led by Olaf Wiest of the University of Notre Dame. Other team members include Nitesh Chawla, also of the University of Notre Dame, Abigail Doyle of Princeton University, Robert Paton of Colorado State University, Richmond Sarpong of the University of California, Berkeley, and Matthew Sigman of the University of Utah. The goal of C-CAS is to combine data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, chemical reactions and selectivity optimization, computational chemistry, and organic synthesis to transform how the synthesis of complex organic molecules is planned and executed. This center will transform chemical synthesis and increase the economic and societal competitiveness of pharmaceutical, chemical, and technology industries within the US. The research efforts are enhanced through multiple industrial partnerships. As a result, a new generation of interdisciplinary teams of ""data chemists"" and machine learning scholars will be trained to address the challenges and demands of modern synthetic chemistry. A network of research, networking and professional development opportunities will be established to bridge the gap between disciplines, drawing students from a broad range of backgrounds including students with disabilities.  Social and mass media will be utilized to engage the general public. <br/><br/>The vision of C-CAS is to create a comprehensive platform for computationally planning and optimizing synthetic pathways, predicting reaction performance, and addressing the selectivity (e.g., chemo-, regio, stereo-) challenges inherent in complex molecule synthesis. This center has three thrusts.  The first thrust is to use representation learning to unify heterogeneous data from a variety of sources, including unbiased, dense, and ""clean"" microscopic and macroscopic data from the literature, patents, high-throughput experimentation, electronic laboratory notebooks and high-throughput computation.  The second thrust is to exploit this unified data representation to address the ""over-the arrow"" problem of chemical reaction optimization that is the rate-limiting step in most syntheses, through active and transfer learning that will yield interpretable and explainable statistical and machine learning models.  The third thrust is to demonstrate the combined use of heterogeneous data and optimization algorithms with existing synthesis planning programs to score possible synthetic routes and provide synthetic chemists with go/no-go decisions in the synthesis of a complex molecule. C-CAS provides quantitative training to a new generation of ""data chemists"" and to machine learning researchers, thereby equipping them for participation in interdisciplinary science, including industry-academic collaborations. The Center delivers programming such as online and in-person workshops, networking, and formulation and sharing of best practices in this rapidly evolving field that enhances the interdisciplinary experience and societal impact. The data science and computational portion in C-CAS provides non-traditional research and networking opportunities that are particularly suitable to students with disabilities and underrepresented minority students. C-CAS engages non-scientists in discussions of the integration of chemistry and machine learning through mass- and social media as well as in-person communications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the lack of efficient Monte Carlo algorithms has drastically hindered applications of Bayesian methods in the big data era. Compared to frequentist methods, Bayesian methods are often much slower. To tackle this difficulty, a variety of scalable Monte Carlo algorithms have been developed in the recent literature. However, these algorithms can only be applied to static data; none of them can be directly applied to dynamic data.  Many of the problems centering data science, such as natural language processing, autonomous car driving and weather forecasting, are facing challenges of dynamic data. The traditional particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo algorithms lack the scalability necessary for dealing with large-scale dynamic data. By reformulating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) under the framework of Langevin dynamics, this project proposes Langevinized EnKF as a general and scalable stochastic gradient sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian on-line learning with large-scale dynamic data. The Langevinized EnKF improves uncertainty quantification for a wide class of data assimilation problems, advancing the development of trustworthy AI. Successful completion of this project will generate a set of scalable and theoretically rigorous algorithms for Bayesian on-line learning, which can provide significant benefits to the development of data driven technologies. The research results will be disseminated to communities of interest via collaborations, publications, and conference presentations. The project will also have significant impacts on education through direct involvement of graduate students and incorporation of the research results into undergraduate and graduate courses. <br/><br/>Although the EnKF has been extremely successful in dealing with complex dynamic data encountered in  oceanography, reservoir modeling and weather forecasting, it does not converge to the right filtering distribution except for linear systems in the large ensemble limit. The Langevinized EnKF resolves this issue; it converges to the right filtering distribution in data assimilation and is thus able to quantify uncertainty of the underlying dynamic system. The Langevinized EnKF can also be used for Bayesian learning with large-scale statistic data by reformulating the Bayesian inverse problem as a state-space model with Langevin dynamics and the subsampling technique. Different variants of the Langevinized EnKF will be developed to extend its applications to non-Gaussian data and incomplete data. As the whole, this project will provide a complete treatment for Bayesian analysis of big data. The Langevinized EnKF can be applied to big data problems in various data scenarios: dynamic data and static data, Gaussian data and non-Gaussian data, and complete data and incomplete data,  provided the data is classified in different ways. Statistical theory underlying the Langevinized EnKF will be rigorously studied. Exciting scientific applications, including language modeling and dynamic network analysis, will be conducted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly all higher cognitive functions depend on the activity patterns of cortical neuron populations.  These activity patterns are shaped by the structure of connectivity between cortical neurons and, conversely, cortical connectivity is shaped by cortical activity through changes in connection strengths called ""synaptic plasticity.""  This project will develop novel computational models and mathematical analyses to understand the interplay between cortical connectivity and cortical activity, and how it gives rise to cognitive functions like sensory processing and motor learning.  The results will lead to a better understanding of how the cortex functions and how it dysfunctions in disease states.  The results will also inform the development of biologically-inspired machine learning algorithms.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research and benefit from coursework inspired by the research projects.  Students at a public high school will be guided in a project to incorporate learning algorithms from the research into a robot, providing hands on experience with applied mathematics, computer programming, and robotics.<br/><br/>The project comprises three sub-projects that build on each other.  The first sub-project utilizes the notion of excitatory-inhibitory balance in cortical networks to derive scaling laws for connection strengths at large network size.  Previous theoretical work elucidates the computational utility of an inverse square root scaling law and recent experimental work provides biological evidence for it, but the mechanisms through which the law could emerge are unknown.  Candidate biological mechanisms will be analyzed mathematically and evaluated in collaboration with an experimental neuroscientist.  For the second project, the theory of neuronal networks with excitatory and inhibitory balance will be refined and extended to account for the imprecision of balance observed in experiments.  Preliminary calculations suggest that this imprecision is mathematically necessary, produces biologically realistic activity, and invokes intricate response properties that have implications for artificial neural networks used for image analysis.  The third project will develop and analyze a mathematical model of motor learning that combines Hebbian plasticity in a cortical pathway with reward modulated plasticity in a sub-cortical pathway, inspired by experimental observations.  This two-pathway motor learning algorithm has implications for biological motor learning, motor disease, and robotics."

Large uncertainty in the model prediction is problematic as it does now allow careful planning, and failure to identify large fluctuations and possible instabilities could endanger the reliable operation of the power grid. Hence, it is crucial to incorporate new monitoring capabilities realized by new tools such as machine learning and predictive multi-rate modeling in modeling the smart grid. Classical methods that deal with uncertainty lead to inefficient solutions as they are too slow to converge to a solution and hence they cannot be used effectively for real-time control of power grids. This difficulty stems from the requirement of sampling the very complex power grid thousands of times in order to arrive to a reasonably accurate solution. The goal of this project is to establish significant advances in research and education in the development of machine learning and real-time predictive modeling of power systems, with particular focus on the smart grid.<br/><br/>Machine learning and real-time predictive modeling have received increasing attention in recent years. Extensive research effort has been devoted to these topics, and novel numerical methods have been developed to efficiently deal with sensor data and complex engineering systems. Both machine learning and real-time predictive modeling enable us to better extract the useful information from available sensor data and make critical decision in real time with the presence of uncertainties. For example, solar and wind energy will depend on the weather condition. Machine learning and real-time predictive modeling are thus critical to many important practical problems such as power system stability analysis and social cyber-network prediction, etc. For large-scale power systems, deterministic simulations can be very time-consuming, and conducting predictive simulations further increases the simulation cost and can be prohibitively expensive. One of the biggest challenges in machine learning and real-time predictive modeling is how to develop hierarchical reduced-order models and how to fuse information from such hierarchical reduced-order models. This project aims to address these critical challenges. A novel set of deep-learning based multi-fidelity algorithms (deep Gaussian processes) will be developed for real-time prediction of power systems. The approach under development in this research project is based on scalable algorithms for building deep-learning based reduced-order models for efficient power system dimension reduction. The new algorithms will be based on building multi-fidelity models via deep learning for power systems, and they will significantly advance the current state of the art of deep learning and real-time predictive modeling. The project will also integrate educational opportunities and will expand the population of modelers who use machine learning and predictive modeling tools to solve network problems. The project will expose a diverse group of undergraduates and minority students to machine learning and predictive modeling."

The main approach will be to use fast randomized matrix algorithms, as developed within the research area known as Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA).  Prior work has shown that these RandNLA algorithms come with strong theory and that they perform well for many practical data science and machine learning problems.  The foundation will develop novel uses of randomization to combine complementary algorithmic and statistical perspectives. The statistical viewpoint attributes randomness to an inherent and desirable property of the data, while the algorithmic viewpoint claims randomness as a computational resource to be exploited.  The coupling of these complementary approaches poses challenging mathematical problems to be investigated in the proposed work.<br/><br/>The proposed work will establish the foundations for fast prototyping in two directions: A Multi-Pronged Direction to bring RandNLA to the next level and explore what is technically feasible; and an overarching Synergy Direction that fuses the results for prototyping. The Multi-Pronged Direction includes the following topics: (i) Matrix perturbation theory, to bridge the gap between traditional worst-case bounds for asymptotically small perturbations on the one hand; and perturbations caused by stochastic noise, and missing or highly corrupted matrix entries on the other hand. (ii) Implicit versus explicit regularization, where randomness as a computational resource for speeding up algorithms additionally contributes to implicit statistical regularization, thereby improving statistical and numerical robustness. (iii) Krylov space methods for fast computation of good warm-starts and computation of surrogate models in the form of low-rank approximations, and specifically a better understanding of these methods in an algorithm-independent setting. (iv) Randomized basis construction methods that use matrix factorizations to compute low-rank approximations at low to moderate levels of accuracy. The Synergy Direction will explore topics like ultra-low accuracy matrix computations in machine learning applications, where merely a correct sign or exponent is sufficient. As a group, the PIs possess unrivaled and complementary expertise in applying fundamental mathematical tools to numerical applications in machine learning, data mining and scientific computing.  Importantly, the proposed methods will have significant impact in big data analysis, scientific computing, data mining and machine learning, where matrix computations are of paramount importance. The proposed work is fundamentally interdisciplinary and will enable fast, yet user-friendly extraction of insight from large-scale data these societally-important scientific domains.  Specifically, the proposed work will (i) create a numerically reliable and robust footing for fast prototyping; (ii) advance mathematics at the interface of computer science and statistics, one of the objectives being a synergy of numerical and statistical robustness; and (iii) advance the development of an interdisciplinary community with RandNLA as a pillar for the mathematics of data.

Standard machine learning methods are no longer able to accommodate the computational requirements. They need to be re-designed or adapted, which calls for a new generation of design and theory of scalable learning algorithms for massive data. This project aims to provide a collection of state-of-the-art nonparametric learning tools for big data analysis, which can be directly used by scientists and practitioners and have beneficial impacts on various fields such as biomedicine, health-care, defense and security, and information technology. The deliverables of this project include easy-to-use software packages that will be thoroughly evaluated using a range of application examples. They will directly help scientists to explore and analyze complex data sets.<br/> <br/>Due to storage and computational bottlenecks, traditional statistical inferential procedures originally designed for a single machine are no longer applicable to modern large datasets. This project aims to design new scalable learning algorithms of wide-ranging nonparametric models for data that are distributed across a large number of multi-core computational nodes, or in a fashion of random sketching if only a single machine is available. The computational limits of these new algorithms will be examined from a statistical perspective. For example, in the divide-and-conquer setup, the number of deployed machines can be viewed as a simple proxy for computing cost. The project aims to establish a sharp upper bound for this number: when the number is below this bound, statistical optimality (in terms of nonparametric estimation or testing) is achievable; otherwise, statistical optimality becomes impossible.

The research goal is to develop a systematic deep learning analysis serving as the theoretical foundation of numerous scientific problems based on deep learning; cutting-edge algorithms for the efficient solutions of high-dimensional and highly nonlinear partial differential equations arising in various application domains will also be proposed with a theoretical guarantee. The proposed deep learning-based algorithms for high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems will be expected to greatly advance the state-of-the-art simulations of complex physical systems arising in many fields in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The theoretical challenges of deep learning are largely due to the highly non-linear nature of deep neural networks (DNNs). As a function parametrization tool formulated as compositions of non-linear functions, DNNs are highly non-linear and require advanced mathematics to fully understand. Therefore, there is a critical need for new advances in mathematics for a better understanding of DNNs. The theoretical part of this project mainly focuses on the approximation and generalization capacity of DNNs. The central questions to be answered are whether DNN approximation conquers or lessens the curse of dimensionality, what is the optimal approximation rate of various function classes, and how to characterize the Rademacher complexity of various DNNs trained with state-of-the-art empirical regularization methods aiming at optimal generalization error bound. The computational part of this project concentrates on solving high dimensional and highly oscillatory partial differential equations. The specific approach of this project is to propose hybrid algorithms that combine the advantage of deep learning algorithms and traditional numerical techniques for more efficient computation and higher accuracy. The key idea is to treat deep learning solvers as a preconditioner of traditional numerical algorithms. The algorithms designed in the project will also be implemented in deep learning packages for numerical PDEs and made publicly available. Research outcomes of this project will be disseminated through conferences, publications (journal papers and textbooks), and new mathematical deep learning courses to a broad audience, especially for the next generation of computational scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) project seeks to optimize the composition of RCCAs to achieve an unsurpassed combination of strength and oxidation resistance at high-temperatures. These properties would enable the realization of rotation detonation engines for hypersonic vehicles of interest in national defense and a significant reduction in fuel consumption and pollution over the lifetime of a land-based gas turbines that power the electric grid. In addition to providing hands-on training to graduate students, this program will support undergraduate students who will be exposed to cutting edge research tools in materials science, computer simulations and machine learning.

To encourage widespread use of the technology and data developed, the products of this project will be made available via the nanoHUB open platform, where students, educators, and researchers can explore data and perform simulations online, using a web-browser.<br/><br/>The design and optimization of RCCAs with the combination of properties sought after for high temperature structural applications is a daunting technical task due to the extremely large number of potential alloys, and because the oxidation behavior of these complex alloys is not fully understood. Adding oxidation testing variables (temperature, partial pressure of O2) to the compositional ones, the space to be explored is 17 dimensional, which is clearly out of reach to brute force approaches given the time and cost involved in high-temperature oxidation experiments.

Very often the right and left hand forms interact differently with biological systems, sometimes with profound consequences. One hand may be beneficial while the other hand may also be beneficial, have no effect, or be harmful. As a result, the handedness property is an extremely important consideration in the design and manufacture of molecules such as pharmaceuticals. The most efficient syntheses of chiral molecules use catalysts that are also chiral.  Unfortunately, the synthesis of chiral catalysts often requires inefficient trial and error approaches. In this project, Professors Wiest and Helquist at the University of Notre Dame employ computational chemistry, machine learning, and organic chemistry to develop efficient, fast, and accurate methods to predict how to make chiral molecules. In collaboration with a major pharmaceutical company, these methods are improving access to molecules of importance to the pharmaceutical industry. This new approach to computationally-driven synthesis and the close, long-term collaboration with industry creates unique experiences for their students. These students participate in industrial internships and interdisciplinary training at AstraZeneca in Sweden.  The two senior researchers are actively engaging in broadening participation initiatives at the University of Notre Dame and in the Midwest. These activities include mentoring undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through the Building Bridges program and summer research for high school students.<br/> <br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Wiest and Dr. Helquist of the University of Notre Dame continue the development of the quantum guided molecular mechanics (Q2MM) method for the automated parameterization of transition state force fields (TSFFs) which are then used for the high-throughput virtual screening of enantioselective catalysts (CatVS).  A number of methodological improvements, such as machine learning, new interfaces, and automated parameterization procedures, and TSFFs for new reactions of interests for the synthetic organic community are developed.

Examples of such situations include controlling industrial plants, maneuvering autonomous vehicles, developing new drugs, making investment decisions or staffing decisions in service systems. Modern decision-makers typically use sophisticated probabilistic models to capture uncertainty, and take optimal actions within the framework of such models. In general, the models themselves involve unknown parameters which must be estimated from data. While large datasets improve the estimation of the parameters, leading to more accurate decisions, these big-data settings also raise computational challenges that call for approximations in the estimation. Current methodology typically proceeds in two steps: (1) use the vast statistical and machine learning literature to approximately estimate model parameters, and (2) use the resulting approximations to compute the best possible action. This two-stage procedure can result in sub-optimality of actions, as the approximations computed in the first stage are not tailored to the decision-making problem in the second stage. The objective of this project is to develop and study a methodological framework for approximate computation that puts decision-making at its center, recognizing that the ultimate goal of most big-data analyses is to help decide among actions in the face of uncertainty. The project will provide tools and theory to accurately account for trade-offs between statistical accuracy, decision-theoretic utility and computational complexity, and will integrate decision-making into the computational revolution that has driven much of modern data-science. The tools and theory potentially impact a large range of data-driven decision-making problems. <br/><br/>This project works in the overarching framework of Bayesian statistics, where the primary object of interest is the posterior distribution over the unknown parameters and variables. The research focuses on theoretical and methodological challenges arising from approximate computation for Bayesian decision theory. The investigators consider two complementary problems, (a) Decision-theoretic variational Bayes, and (b) Robust decision-making. The former task analyzes and extends variational methods, developed in the machine learning community to approximate intractable Bayesian posterior distributions, from a decision-theoretic viewpoint. The investigators will theoretically study the optimality of such algorithms with respect to decision-making rather than prediction, and develop novel `loss-calibrated' algorithms that search for approximations using decision-theoretic, rather than inferential criteria. Task (b) recognizes that a model is always an approximation to reality, and is therefore misspecified. As a consequence, a Bayesian posterior distribution, even if calculated exactly, might not actually characterize the distribution over future observations. The investigators explore connections with approximations from the first task, and move from uncertainty about parameters and variables under a specified model, to uncertainty about the choice of model itself. They develop and analyze methodology that allows robust and principled decisions in the face of such `Knightian' uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Realistic computations usually involve enormous amounts of data due to large dense matrices or dense intermediate matrix blocks, which makes classical matrix methods impractical. Hierarchical structured methods provide an effective and reliable way to compress and process large matrix data. In such methods, dense matrix blocks are approximated by compact structured forms that are convenient to handle. This research project aims to develop theoretical foundations for understanding multiple hierarchical structured techniques and for designing new hierarchical structured algorithms. These algorithms are expected to be applicable to more general matrix computations and challenging applications where usual structured methods are not suitable or effective.<br/><br/>Hierarchical structured methods exploit inherent structures in matrix computations to gain high efficiency while ensuring superior stability. This project is concerned with the design, analysis, and application of fast and reliable hierarchical structured methods for broad classes of challenging computations. A unified framework will be provided to understand multiple types of hierarchical structured methods, design new hierarchical methods with enhanced applicability, and analyze their accuracy and stability. State-of-the-art fast and stable solvers will be developed for tackling challenges such as large data sizes, ill conditioning, high frequencies, and multiple frequencies. The new solvers will be applicable to a wide range of matrix computations. Based on data sparsity and enhanced stability, the solvers will significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of many computations in PDE solution, large data analysis, network, machine learning, imaging, seismic modeling, electromagnetics, etc. The research will also make fast and stable structured solvers widely accessible to broader fields and industries. The data will be included in data repositories for unrestricted access. Open-source packages and educational/tutorial materials will be freely available. The multidisciplinary project will provide excellent opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to closely interact and to learn critical computational and mathematical skills from multiple fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tools for testing whether a mathematical structures is suitable for classification are various hypotheses called ""dividing lines"", which forbid some fixed pattern in the behavior of a structure. A main focus of this project is one such dividing line called VC-dimension, which originated in machine learning, and uses ideas from graph theory to measure randomness in mathematical objects. In model theory, this notion emerged in the study of so-called ""NIP theories"". Conant will apply this model theoretic framework to questions in group theory, from both the discrete and topological perspectives, and also in the newer field of arithmetic combinatorics, which is a fusion of algebra, analysis, and discrete math. <br/><br/>A large part of past research in model theory has focused on structures which exhibit tameness at the global level, in the sense that every definable relation in the structure omits a combinatorial configuration of some fixed type. This research focuses on the local level, in which one analyzes a single tame relation inside an otherwise complicated structure. A major aim is to develop an algebraic theory of NIP formulas in arbitrary groups, which continues prior research of Conant and Pillay in the case of pseudofinite groups. A second aim is to extend this work on pseudofinite groups outside of the NIP environment. This setting is suitable for applications to arithmetic combinatorics in finite groups, for example previous research of Conant, Pillay, and Terry on tame arithmetic regularity. In the proposed research, Conant will use Lie theory and representation theory to develop arithmetic regularity in the pseudofinite setting without extra tameness assumptions. The goal is to give a model theoretic account of arithmetic regularity results of Green and Tao, and extend these results to non-commutative groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investment decisions are based on prices, updated every microsecond, for thousands of securities; atmospheric scientists use multiresolution satellite images to understand climate change; and internet companies exploit massive music collections to infer trends in tastes and preferences. Rigorous analysis of these large datasets requires a balance between computational constraints and statistical performance, and operationalizing such tradeoffs involves a combination of algorithmic and design-based approximations. For example, decreasing the resolution of an image or subsampling high-throughput data enables faster computations but removes potentially valuable information. At the same time, elaborate explanations of the scientific process are credible because they account for real-world complexity, but estimating complex models requires both more data and larger computers. The proposed work investigates the viability of modern statistical and machine learning methodologies for answering applied scientific questions. The project will create new algorithms and open-source software for combining computational approximations with regularization for analyzing large datasets as well as providing theoretical justification for their statistical properties. A more complete picture of the interplay between statistical regularization, computational approximation, and scientific parsimony will enable fundamental scientific advancement. The PI will employ the methodologies developed in this project to facilitate novel science with large datasets in climate science, biology, music analysis, astronomy, economics, and chemistry. Furthermore, the PI will carefully integrate the research aims with educational and outreach objectives to engage elementary and high school music students, introducing them to modern statistics and computer science, as well as integrating underrepresented populations in research.<br/><br/><br/>Computational tractability and statistical efficiency for large datasets necessitate approximation or regularization, either of which heuristically balances fidelity to the data with scientific goals like parsimony, smoothness, sparsity, or interpretability. The PI seeks to elucidate the dual roles of regularization and approximation as tools for better scientific understanding. Current research in computer science has focused on improving algorithms so as to enable computation with minimal approximation. Meanwhile, statisticians have developed regularization techniques in order to take advantage of simple structures - graph topologies, sparse linear models, smooth functions - that, if representative of the truth, will improve inference and prediction. The challenge is to understand the consequences of this coupling for scientific interpretability. The PI seeks to address two important issues (1) how do we select tuning parameters when computations are at a premium? and (2) how does the accuracy and stability of scientific conclusions relate to the approximation/regularization methods used to obtain those conclusions? This project seeks to enable fundamental scientific progress by understanding the connections between computational approximations and statistical regularization, thereby facilitating improved inferences. The PI will fill this gap by deriving practical algorithms with accompanying theoretical justification under more reasonable statistical assumptions.

Even so, the limitations in this approximation have now become evident. Especially when dealing with dilute plasmas, charge separation cannot be accommodated in MHD. To match the full range of observational data and experiments, it is imperative to provide the plasma physics community with a capability that goes beyond the MHD approximation. The work aims at developing high-order accurate, efficient and easy-to-use numerical methods for simulation-driven discoveries related to multiscale electromagnetohydrodynamic problems on complex geometry. Indeed, the methods developed will actually offer high-order accuracy and extremely robust performance for any conservation law beyond electromagnetics or elasticity applications. Therefore, several other fields of great importance in science and engineering, and indeed of great importance to the NSF mission, will be directly benefited by the methods developed here. Training a new generation of computational scientists capable of conducting interdisciplinary research is one of the central activities of the work. Courses relevant to the research such as numerical partial differential equations, advanced scientific computing, uncertainty quantification and machine learning have been introduced by the investigators and will be renovated by incorporating outcomes from the project into course materials. <br/> <br/>The specific objectives of this project are to develop, analyze and evaluate data-enabled high-order accurate and robust computational modeling tools for simulating multiscale high energy density plasma flows containing both continuum and rarefied regimes in complex geometry. Both new high-order divergence-constraint-preserving central discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme on overlapping unstructured grid cells for simulating continuum plasma coupled with Maxwell's equations, and asymptotic preserving central DG scheme for solving Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann (VMB) equations to model the dilute plasma flow will be developed. An innovative data-enabled stochastic concurrent coupling algorithm combining these schemes will be also devised for multiscale simulations. In this coupling algorithm, a novel data-enabled stochastic heterogeneous domain decomposition method to exchange statistical distribution at the interface of continuum and rarefied regimes will be developed. This will be the first attempt to stochastically couple continuum and kinetic plasma flow models. There is no current capability that integrates these unique advances, and the investigators will be the first group to deliver such a forward-looking capability to the plasma physics community. All numerical simulations will be validated by advanced data-enabled uncertainty quantification method developed in this project. A large-scale parallel code with these capabilities will be developed and released to the plasma physics community. It will not only enable the plasma physics community to carry out transformational simulations for new discoveries related to the multiscale electromagnetohydrodynamic physics for the first time but also lower the threshold for new computational scientists to use the new cutting-edge numerical methods for other applications such as nonlinear optics. Simulations will be used to explain new observations such as enhanced electron transport, which are difficult to study experimentally in a harsh plasma environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Images of three dimensional, volumetric, structures provide indispensable spatial information about organs, tissues, and molecules that cannot be captured using two dimensions. The development of tools for efficient and effective analysis of such volumetric data sets is, therefore, urgently required. This project will develop generally applicable mathematical and computational frameworks to effectively and accurately represent, compare, and retrieve biological and medical data in three dimensions. The methods to be developed will provide a general foundation for the analysis of volumetric images obtained using multiple imaging modalities and for multiple data types, not only from the biological domain. For example, the techniques have broader impact in areas such as human face recognition, analysis of geographical and climate data, and computer-aided design. This project, therefore, contributes to general promotion of the progress of science and technology in many domains in which imaging analysis is crucial and is of significant societal impact. <br/><br/>In this project, two complementary and synergistic methods will be developed and integrated. The first method to be developed is a mathematical moment-based approach that provides a compact representation of volumetric data and is very suitable for localized three dimensional image data comparison. A two dimensional image comparison method that is based on a moment-based invariant will be expanded to handle volumetric data. The second method is a machine learning approach that will be powerful in classifying volumetric data. These two approaches will be integrated to take advantage of both methods and validated using three dimensional protein structural data. Analyzing global and local similarities between protein shapes is critical for understanding protein function but challenging because proteins with substantially different shapes may perform the same function. Further, proteins are appropriate for this validation step not only because many structures are available in well-established public databases but also because they lack intrinsic orientation, unlike previously studied datasets of man-made objects such as cars, cups, and tables. As the proposed methods are defined for a general voxel representation of a given volume, they will be generally applicable for any data set yielding a voxel representation, including biomedical data collected using electron microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Along side the scientific impact of the project, it also leverages efforts in the interdisciplinary computational life sciences and engineering departments at Purdue University and Eastern Kentucky University by recruiting and training students through interdisciplinary coursework and direct involvement with the project."

One example is from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of neuroimaging, which obtains local information of neural activity through  3 by 3  positive definite matrices. DTI has clinical applications in the study and treatment of neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, as well as in detecting subtle abnormalities related to a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia). Other examples of complex data include digital images in machine vision, where a digital image can be represented by a set of landmarks, forming certain shapes.  One may also encounter data that are stored in complex forms such as subspaces, surfaces, curves, and networks. The investigator will characterize the structure or geometry of complex data, and incorporate the geometry in developing valid statistical models for inference. In addition to complex data, it is also a common practice  to collect high-dimensional data across many disciplines such as biology, public health and neuroscience. Being able to learn the often lower-dimensional geometry of the  high-dimensional data is essential for accurate statistical inference and decision making in society. The investigator will utilize the geometry in developing valid statistical methods, which will be applied to medical data and neuroscience data, which has potential far-reaching impact in applied fields.

It is challenging to assemble them into larger superstructures. Along these lines, this award, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, addresses the forefront of modern nanoscience and nanotechnology-related research. Using polymers as solvents to synthesize ultrasmall tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) NCs this project targets a material with potential applications in fabrication of improved optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and photocatalytic solar fuel production. The project investigates how surface attachment of appropriately chosen organic molecules produces hybrid-ITO NCs (artificial molecules), and as a consequence alters the optoelectronic and electrochemical properties of the individual ITO NCs and their assemblies. Traditionally these properties are varied by changing the inorganic core size of NCs. Because of the different underlying mechanism to tune properties, the impact of this research is expected to be far-reaching in the context of new materials design, advancing molecular level understanding in nanoscience and materials chemistry, and economic expansion and sustainability. Additionally, this project provides multidisciplinary research training opportunities, including inorganic chemistry, materials science and nanotechnology, for graduate and undergraduate students. Through these activities the principle investigator fosters the next generation STEM educators and innovators.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Ligand-passivated nanocrystals (NCs) are of immense interest to chemists, physicists, and materials scientists, because NC-ligand interfacial electronic interactions and bonding greatly impact their chemical and physical properties. Through this Solid State and Materials Chemistry-funded project the principle investigator synthesizes and characterizes a new class of ultrasmall, quantum confined hybrid-ITO NCs. Functionalizing the NC core with uniquely designed aromatic ligands allows the researchers to manipulate the interaction and electronic coupling of interfacial energetic states between the inorganic (ITO core) and organic surface ligands. This leads to new structure-function relationships, which are fundamentally different from those previously characterized in traditional larger ITO NCs. Specific objectives of this project include: (1) experimentally characterizing the optoelectronic properties of this new class of hybrid-ITO NCs, both to understand the fundamental chemical and structural processes that exist at the NC-ligand interface and to control electronic coupling between individual energetic state of the NC and ligands, (2) correlating experimental spectroscopic data with computational models to predict the effects of the NC size and the electronic and/or chemical structure of surface ligands on optoelectronic properties, and (3) predictably assembling hybrid ITO-NCs into artificial solids and then measuring charge transfer and transport properties in the solid-state with the aim of understanding mechanisms controlling such phenomena. Taken together, results from this project are crucial in ultimately guiding the preparation of novel inorganic-organic hybrid nanomaterials to increase efficiency of solid-state optoelectronic devices and photocatalysts."

This CAREER project will investigate the possibility of making quantum mechanics appear manifest in larger, more macroscopic, systems.  In specific, the project will investigate how to couple the spin of an electron to the motion of a nanoparticle (containing millions of atoms). The nanoparticle will be levitated by a laser beam in vacuum to avoid perturbations from the environment. This system should serve as a very sensitive force detector with many applications.

The research will be integrated with several related educational activities, including direct training of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and conducting inquiry workshops about infrared light for middle and high school teachers and students. Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but plays a crucial role in global warming and fiber-optic communication.  In the present work, infrared light will be used to levitate nanoparticles in vacuum. After doing hands-on experiments with infrared light in the workshop, teachers will be able to take their apparatus for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, this research project will develop a system that combines the advantages of both trapped atoms and conventional optomechanical systems for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics: an optically levitated nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. In some ways, this system can be considered to be an ""artificial atom"" with a very large mass. The electron spin of the NV center can be coupled to the motion of the nanodiamond with a magnetic field gradient. This coupling can be used to create large quantum spatial superposition states of the nanodiamond, which will lead to the development of a nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in unexplored parameter regimes. The main focus of this CAREER project will be to experimentally study the coupling between an NV electron spin and both the center-of-mass motion and the rotation of an optically levitated nanodiamond. The motion of the levitated nanodiamond will be cooled to near quantum ground state by active feedback cooling. The NV electron spin will be used to sense and manipulate the motion of the nanodiamond. It will also be used to measure the internal temperature of the levitated nanodiamond which affects the quantum coherence time."

These quantum dots are efficient light absorbers and potentially useful for devices such as solar cells or light emitting diodes. In a device, quantum dots must be closely packed together in order to facilitate energy transfer from one quantum dot to the next. As a result, the distance between quantum dots and the speed at which energy migrates has a strong effect on device efficiency. By imaging how energy moves in quantum dot solids with different packings, this research aims to provide guidelines for designing structures for efficient light energy harvesting through control of energy migration rates. To achieve these goals, synthetic strategies are developed to control the size of the quantum dots and the chemical linkers used to connect them. Then, these quantum dots are used as ?artificial atoms? and assembled into well-ordered structures known as superlattices. The research team also develops microscopy techniques to record fast energy transfer events with a resolution of 10 femtoseconds (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second) and to image energy migration distances with a resolution of 50 nanometers (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter).  The research and educational activities are integrated to educate the next generation of solar energy researchers through K-12, undergraduate, and graduate science education. The PIs partner with Science Express and AP Fridays at Purdue to involve K-12 students in a cutting-edge laboratory environment. Results from this project are utilized to educate the general public on new solar energy technologies using podcast and video media.<br/><br/>Long-range exciton transport and coherence in colloidal quantum dot solids are highly desirable for their optoelectronic and quantum information applications. However, exciton transport in colloidal quantum dot solids thus far has been almost exclusively realized in the incoherent regime with excitons localized in individual quantum dots due to the relatively large energetic disorder compared to the electronic coupling strength in these systems. Incoherent transport of localized excitons presents a major limitation in obtaining long-range coherence and transport. In this project, strong dipole-dipole interactions between perovskite quantum dots are leveraged to enhance transport by promoting coherent motion of delocalized excitons. The team elucidates transport mechanisms by employing ultrafast coherent microscopy with ~10 fs time resolution and better than 50 nm spatial resolution. Exciton propagation distance, delocalization length, and coherent transport contributions are measured as a function of temperature. The extent of exciton delocalization is systematically controlled by varying inter-particle distance, electronic coupling, and dimensionality using ligand chemistry. The project provides guidelines for designing excitonic materials using perovskite quantum dots as building blocks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Slipchenko of Purdue University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop methods to describe systems that harness light energy for useful applications.  One example of a mechanism of this type is photosynthesis in plants, but there are a host of artificial systems that attempt to mimic plants.   Usually systems of this type have compact charge distributions, but recent work has shown that states with diffuse charge distributions may also be capable of capturing and using light energy.  These states have been shown to exist in a variety of nanomaterials, including graphene sheets, nanotubes and fullerenes, and these states holds promise to develop a new class of materials with superior properties for electronics applications. Dr. Slipchenko and her group are developing theoretical and computational methods for the accurate description of such diffuse states in molecular crystals.  Armed with these methods, Dr. Slipchenko is also exploring possibilities for energy and electron transport through these diffuse states in molecular clusters. New methods and algorithms developed in this project are broadly distributed and serve as robust tools to predict the behavior of light-induced phenomena in chemistry, biology, and materials. Dr. Slipchenko serves as a role model for female students and postdocs and provides support and advice in career-life balancing challenges. She also organizes national and international conferences and works to increase the participation and visibility of young female scientists.   <br/><br/>Dr. Slipchenko and her group develop theoretical and computational methodologies that can be applied for rigorous description of diffuse Rydberg and Rydberg-like states in extended systems such as molecular crystals of relevance to optoelectronic materials and natural organic aggregates motivated by photosynthetic complexes. The methodology is based on a fully embedded quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach, in which the environment (MM part) is described by the sophisticated ab initio-based Effective Fragment Potential (EFP), and the interaction between QM and MM subsystems includes electrostatic, polarization, dispersion and exchange-repulsion terms, all of which are described at a quantum-mechanical level. In this project, Dr. Slipchenko and her group are exploring possibilities for energy and electron transport through utilization of Rydberg states in molecular materials by development of full embedding QM/EFP methods for electronic excited states and development of vibronic coupling models that describe exciton interactions and transport in molecular crystals and other multi-chromophore systems. The project contributes to the research infrastructure by integrating new computer codes in the open-source, freely available libefp library and in the open-source PSI4, GAMESS, NWChem and MOLCAS electronic structure packages, as well as open-source modules in the Q-Chem quantum chemistry software. Web-based interactive software for predicting vibronic interactions and energy/electron transport in molecular aggregates is being developed and is available at the Purdue University NanoHUB.

In food science, the crystallinity of starches within potatoes and pasta directly dictate bioavailability of the stored energy content. In renewable energy, biochemical degradation of biomass is greatly affected by the degree of crystallinity. Biomineralization also relies on careful control over crystal phase, often resulting in selection of metastable structures. In pharmaceutical materials, physical solid state form can profoundly affect bioavailability and drug efficacy. Reliably measurement and monitoring of how crystal forms and transforms requires tools capable of reporting crystalline content at low levels. With the support of this grant, Professors Simpson and Bouman work closely with their industrial partners to develop fast and sensitive imaging tools to do just that.  Through close partnership with AbbVie and Formulatrix, the developed approach is expected to bring impacts in pharmaceutical formulations development and other areas, such as pretreatment of biomass for energy conversion and artificial biomineralization.  In addition to working with their undergraduate and graduate students closely on the project, professor Simpson also organizes an intensive summer short-course program on nonlinear optics that more than 160 students have participated in the past ten years. Professor Simpson plans now to produce short videos on the topics discussed at the short course program and makes it available to a much broader audience through YouTube.  <br/><br/>In the present work, Professors Simpson, Bouman, and their groups work on reducing the detection limits of Raman spectroscopy by several orders of magnitude to enable analysis of glassy metastable assemblies, targeting detection limits in the parts per million (ppm) regime. Three complementary approaches are pursued to achieve this objective, all of which center on signal to noise enhancement through background reduction. In the first, SHG is used to rapidly identify regions of interest for targeted Raman analysis, building on the inherent speed and selectivity of SHG for chiral crystals. In addition, a dynamic sampling strategy is adopted for analysis of the SHG-inactive components of formulations, in which spatially sparse sampling informed by the preceding set of outcomes is used for efficient hyperspectral imaging reconstruction. Finally, a spectral sparse sampling strategy for beam-scanning imaging using a photomultiplier tube array allows low-noise measurements for hyperspectral Raman imaging. Complementing these spectral characterization approaches, triboluminescence detection will be developed for fast screening. All efforts greatly benefit from close partnership between collaborators working in pharmaceutical formulations development (AbbVie) and instrumentation companies (Formulatrix) positioned to transition innovations in the research laboratory to viable commercial products. While the primary focus of the work is on metastable systems of relevance to industrial collaborators, the results of this work provides a foundation for expansion to other metastable biological assemblies, including pretreatment of biomass for energy conversion, crystallinity in edible products, and fundamentals of biomineralization.  Professor Simpson organizes a week- long intensive program, Chautauqua on Nonlinear Optics for graduate student from research groups worldwide. The program focuses on in-depth understanding of the theoretical and practical fundamentals of nonlinear optics and aims to build a community operating within a common framework for performing and interpreting nonlinear optical measurements."

While proof-of-principle demonstrations of quantum-enhanced performance have shown promise in simple systems, their extension to scalable, integrated platforms have been stymied by decoherence, dissipation and other deleterious environmental influences. Intensive efforts have been made to further isolate these quantum platforms from such environmental interactions, but this approach grows increasingly formidable with growing complexity of the quantum system. An alternate paradigm of ""reservoir engineering"" has suggested that artificially imposed forms of dissipation can, counter-intuitively, lead to robust forms of quantum behavior. Recent theoretical and experimental studies by the PIs have identified forms of reservoir-engineered open quantum systems that exhibit novel dynamical quantum states with robust, finite temperature entanglement. This project seeks to build upon these studies to demonstrate reservoir engineering techniques for state preparation, manipulation and quantum control of a multifunctional hybrid system that interfaces ultracold atoms and silicon carbide defect qubits within a MEMS-based optomechanical resonator. In addition to elucidating universal principles governing reservoir-engineered open quantum systems, this multifunctional hybrid system will also be used to demonstrate quantum-enhanced metrology in a scalable, integrated platform. <br/><br/>The multifunctional hybrid quantum system leverages unique capabilities of this team including (i) fundamental conceptual advances in the use of reservoir-engineering techniques to create topologically protected forms of entanglement in an open quantum system, (ii) expertise in strong coupling of ultracold quantum spins to MEMS-based optomechanical resonators for spin-mediated control and sensing, (iii) expertise in fabrication of high quality single crystal silicon carbide optomechanical resonators, (iv) expertise in the deterministic placement and control of silicon carbide defect centers. The achievement of augmented strain coupling between defect qubits and optomechanical MEMS devices will enable the stabilization, state readout and dissipation control of the hybrid system. As part of this program, this team will also demonstrate the high quality devices with strong optomechanical and strain coupling between ultracold spin qubits, SiC defect qubits and microtoroidal optomechanical resonators. This multifunctional hybrid system is a novel laboratory for the demonstration and validation of reservoir-engineering paradigms for quantum state preparation, control and metrology. In addition, it also enables the study of universal principles of open quantum systems including dynamical states with novel broken symmetries, driven dissipative phase transitions and critical behavior that have no counterpart in equilibrium systems.

Examples include internet searches, social networks, mobile devices, satellites, genomics, medical scans, etc. Bayesian approaches are particularly useful in such context since the complex structures in the data can be naturally incorporated in Bayesian hierarchical models. Besides, uncertainty quantification can be easily executed through Bayesian computation. However, due to storage and computational bottlenecks, traditional Bayesian computation implemented in a single machine is no longer applicable to modern massive data. In this project, a set of nonparametric Bayesian aggregation procedures with theoretical justifications are developed based on a standard parallel computing strategy known as Divide-and-Conquer. This research will significantly enhance the availability of Bayesian tools and software for analyzing massive data. The educational plan of the project will be in the form of graduate student advising and offering of special topics courses. <br/><br/>This project consists of three major components. First, the PIs will establish a Gaussian approximation of general nonparametric posterior distributions which serves as a theoretical foundation for general distributed Bayesian algorithms. Second, the PIs will develop a nonparametric Bayesian aggregation procedure with theoretical guarantees that is particularly useful to handle massive data in a parallel fashion. Third, the PIs will develop an efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for nonparametric Bayesian models which will perform as well as traditional MCMC with substantially less computational costs. This research will lead to an emergence of ""Splitotics (Split+Asymptotics) Theory"" providing theoretical guidelines for Bayesian practices. The smoothing spline inference results recently obtained by the PIs will be used as a promising tool for achieving the above goals."

Sometimes these spaces exist as physical objects such as the surface of planet or a cell, or the universe itself; sometimes they appear as abstract spaces in applied situations, such as the set of all possible states of a physical system, the set of possible configurations of a machine, or the set of strategies of a group of players in the stock market. In these situations, it is often important to find and study the properties of objects inside these spaces that are optimal in some sense: for example, the shortest way to move between two configurations, or the surface that minimizes area or surface tension. Sometimes these geometric sub-objects come in families (e.g., foliations that slice the space into thin pieces), and it is important to study not just each of these pieces by itself, but the whole family as a unique entity. This project will study several instances of these important and very natural objects, and draw new bridges between these geometric concepts and other more abstract areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to study certain structures of Riemannian manifolds such as singular Riemannian foliations and closed minimal submanifolds, and relate them to the geometry and topology of the ambient space. In the study of singular Riemannian foliations, the main focus will be on laying new theoretical ground (e.g., continuing the development of an invariant theory in this context) and applying these concepts in different areas, such as producing new manifolds with positive and non-negative curvature, or exhibiting new immersed minimal hypersurfaces in round spheres and projective spaces. In the study of closed minimal submanifolds, the main focus will be on the index of such objects, especially in the two extreme cases of closed geodesics and minimal hypersurfaces. The PI will continue working on a conjecture of Berger on manifolds with all geodesics closed, and on a conjecture of Marques-Neves-Schoen on minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. In the first case, the plan is to improve the understanding of the equivariant Morse theory on the free loop space of spaces with all geodesics closed.

The experimental results expand our knowledge of the fundamental structure of the nucleus as a multi-body quantum system; they also provide new insight for the astrophysics community on the origin of the elements and the chemical evolution of the cosmos from the Big Bang to the present.  The NSL is uniquely equipped for performing this kind of research in a university environment.

Each year over a five year period, 20 sophomore trainees will take part in the STAT-LLC that involve a new project-based course in big data analysis, new mentored research collaborations and thrusts, a new seminar series, professional development initiatives, and living together in a new learning community.  The project leaders will schedule 3 core courses (probability theory, statistical theory, and data analysis) and the seminar series in blocks, so students take these courses together as a cohort (and still have plenty of time for individual electives), live together in a dormitory, and participate in a research experience that lasts 12 months (start of sophomore year to start of junior year).  The Senior Personnel are 12 faculty from the Department of Statistics at Purdue University.  Additional faculty mentors will hail from Actuarial Science, Atmospheric/Earth Science, Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Health and Human Sciences, and the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering and be supported by administrators, academic advisors, and recruiters.

We conjecture that the project will promote retention, instill confidence in the students, help propel the students through the formative second year of college, and prepare them to apply for graduate school.  This holistic experience should result in more students pursuing double majors: Statistics and an applied major in a data-oriented discipline.  Our assessment of this comprehensive training experience should reveal new insights into the way that pairing academic coursework, research, professional development, and residential life at the sophomore level can alleviate the sophomore slump within STEM disciplines.  The Senior Personnel will offer faculty training workshops at national meetings to teach colleagues how to unite the aspects of the sophomore experience in a relevant way for their campuses.  The workshops will be free, to maximize participation by faculty who would not otherwise have access to such resources, networking, partnerships, and professional development opportunities.  As a result, more campuses will be able to offer research experiences for sophomores in the context of a learning community.

In these systems, the team will consider the possibility of interlayer particle-hole pairs --excitons-- forming a condensate with behavior unexpected in either material individually (e.g., a valley superfluid.) The highly anisotropic structure of BP offers the possibility of inducing strong anisotropy in a partnered material such as graphene, and the team will explore the effects of this on both the single-particle and collective behavior of the graphene electrons, including the possibility of inducing superconductivity or charge-density-wave states. Studies of aligned graphene on a TI surface, in which the microstructure forms a moire pattern with a large unit cell, will focus on quantum Hall states with spontaneously broken symmetry, where opposing surfaces of the TI, hosting very different electronic states, are topologically tied together. The project also involves studies of twisted bilayer graphene, focusing on observed magnetic field effects in the vicinity of the Mott insulating/superconducting states, where novel electronic ordering may be occurring.<br/><br/>As an NSF-BSF collaboration, this project will provide valuable training for young physicists, in methods for analyzing electronic materials, as well as in learning to work and collaborate within an international setting. Young women science students will benefit from regular visits to Indiana University by the senior Israeli participant, who will engage with students in the Women in Science group in the Physics Department, as well as with undergraduates at IU's STEM Living and Learning Center where she will become a visiting faculty fellow. The PI will participate in outreach at the annual IU ScienceFest, for which physics-based interactive activities for school children will be introduced. The PI will also mentor students in the IU Physics Department's Bridge Program. Through these activities both participants will seek to involve students from under-represented groups in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

QuarkNet has created an ongoing national community of researchers that include high school teachers and students as well as physicists. QuarkNet's goals are to maintain and enhance this community, to attract young students to careers in science and technology, to help develop scientific literacy in society, and to develop links between the high school classroom and experiments and techniques used to explore the scientific frontier. <br/><br/>Key features of QuarkNet are the establishment of mentor relationships between teachers and scientists, summer research experiences for teachers, and the development of a scientific and learning community within and among centers. QuarkNet provides opportunities for teachers to become more professional, resulting in the development of programming for peers in the center, in their schools and districts and beyond.  QuarkNet provides a centrally hosted, scalable, parallel cyberlearning environment as a cloud-like service. Held at university and laboratory centers, Masterclasses are institutes for teams of students who become physicists for a day, analyzing real experimental data and discussing results in videoconferences with peers and physicists.  Under this five-year award, QuarkNet will support more than 50 centers participating in a variety of experiments at CERN, Fermilab and in non-accelerator and astrophysics programs.  In this five-year period, the QuarkNet Program will support: (1) the local programs of the long-term QuarkNet centers for ~400 teachers per year who receive stipends; (2) a few teachers with multi-week summer research appointments to work under the guidance of physicists from a university or laboratory near their homes should new centers join the collaboration; (3) 120 teachers who will attend a one-week particle physics Data Camp at Fermilab to be immersed in an intensive experience to learn more particle physics and one that models an investigation approach to inquiry teaching and learning; (4) 32 fellows with continuing training that gives them the knowledge and skills to offer professional development experiences for other teachers; and (5) 100 teachers who will be involved with masterclasses.  Over the five years (2018-2022) this project is expected to reach, in addition to the teachers, more than 150 physicists, and eventually well over 100,000 students.

Such interactions ultimately enable a myriad of phenomena, such as the sticky pads on gecko feet, as well as photosynthesis. This project addresses the outstanding challenge to increase the range of such microscopic interactions to much larger lengths, thus also impacting future development of photonic devices for optical information processing. The research develops a nanostructured material platform which molds the flow of light energy, so that embedded atoms and molecules are able to strongly interact with each other over long distances. The project also pushes frontiers of materials design by studying interactions of fast electrons and pairs of photons - small bundles of light - with the structured medium. The project puts forth an innovation in education: Discovery-Centered Learning and Teaching to augment the currently prevalent Knowledge-Centered approach. The goal is to impact industry researchers and undergraduate students about device applications of strongly interacting photonic systems through online courses. The project also addresses the challenge of engaging high school science teachers to incorporate the laboratory's discovery process in teaching pedagogy through state-wide and national conferences.<br/><br/>Technical description: One of the major challenges of modern photonics is to engineer interactions between quantum emitters for building non-classical light sources beyond the laser, enhancing quantum coherence for inter-molecular energy transfer and achieving fundamentally new collective quantum states between light and matter. These dipole-dipole interactions arise from vacuum fluctuations causing quantum emitters in the near-field to interact with each other. However, such interactions scale dramatically with distance which fundamentally limits many phenomena such as Van der Waals forces, Forster resonance energy transfer, collective super-radiance and Lamb shifts to the near-field. This project aims to overcome the long-standing challenge of near-field interactions between quantum emitters at the single photon level through the development of a unique materials platform. The approach uses a structured metamaterial with engineered energy-momentum dispersion engineering (k-surface engineering) to enhance dipole-dipole interactions. This research activity involves a paradigm shift of controlling the non-radiative Coulombic near-fields and marks a departure from circuit QED, photonic crystals, micro-cavities or optical lattice approaches which only engineer radiative interactions. The research activity additionally pushes the frontiers of materials probing through the development of new tools - momentum space electron energy loss spectroscopy and entangled bi-photon spectroscopy. The educational component of this project puts forth an innovation in education called Discovery-Centered Learning and Teaching, to widely disseminate the research findings through online courses and conferences targeting high school science teachers, undergraduate students and industry researchers."

The significant interaction between these areas has recently begun with ""applied"" algebraic topology, finding a wide range of applications in sensor networks, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, manifold learning, linguistics, and cosmology. This is due to the fact that many of the data set handled by applied topologists are based on a random sample from a larger population or contain different types of errors. Failure to capture the stochastic nature of topological data can result in a serious misunderstanding of the topology of the system. For example, the layer of extraneous topologies triggered by heavy-tailed errors, as a phenomena analogous to that of audio crackle in temporal signal analysis, will make it very hard to recover an underlying topology of the system. Another example includes topology on non-Euclidean spaces, especially those negatively curved. One good motivation for this study lies in its tree-like structure as a result of negative curvature. By virtue of this structure, the resulting non-Euclidean model can potentially be employed for analyses of various complex networks in physics, computer science, and cosmology. Combining topological concepts with the notion of randomness, this projects aims to properly understand random topology of the system. <br/> <br/>This project addresses research questions on random algebraic topology. Despite its recent development, most of the studies on random algebraic topology do not pay sufficient attentions to how heaviness or lightness of the tail of probability distributions affects the topology. One of the main focuses is on topological crackle - the layered structure of topological elements, typically caused by a heavy-tailed distribution. Although topological crackle has been recognized, at least empirically, in the statistical manifold learning, this project investigates it thoroughly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In light of the involvement of heavy-tailed distributions, extreme value theory (EVT) will be selected as a main tool for this study. Relying on EVT, the PI aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a graphical descriptor of the birth and death of topological cycles, called persistence diagram. One of the main focuses is on the random configuration of points in the persistence diagram by regarding them as a random closed set and discussing their asymptotics in terms of the Fell topology. As the second main topic, the project attempts to investigate random topology on the negatively curved non-Euclidean space. The PI mainly deals with a theoretical question: How do the parameters of the hyperbolic space, including its negative curvature, characterize the random topology? As expected, new phenomena will be uncovered that are never seen in the usual Euclidean setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the cream, soap, and gel we use in everyday life, the food we eat, and the biological matter we are made of is classified as soft material. Soft materials include matter such as colloidal dispersions (paints, milk), polymers (plastics, fibers), biological matter (proteins, cells), and liquid crystals (electronic displays). The PI is particularly motivated by biological soft materials that dynamically change their shape in response to chemical and mechanical cues. For example, proteins change conformations in response to changes in ion concentration to enable specific biological processes, and red blood cells deform reversibly to enable their passage through thin capillaries. Researchers have long sought to mimic this intrinsic adaptability of biological materials in the design of synthetic matter. In this project, the PI will develop powerful computational methods to link the inherent attributes of soft-matter-based nanoparticles with their mechanistic behavior, including stable shapes, real-time shape evolution, and self-organization into larger nanostructures.<br/><br/>The PI's research team will program the surface charge and elasticity patterns of charged soft-matter-based nanoparticles such as virus-like nanocages and polymeric nanomembranes to enable controlled shape adaptation. Establishing the links between surface pattern and shape will guide the development of deformable nanocontainers into drug-delivery carriers that adapt their shape to evolving physiological conditions and biological barriers. The findings will also elucidate the principles of designing shape-reconfigurable nanoparticles that can act as building blocks of next-generation materials with responsive properties tailored for specific applications, such as shape-shifting microrobots and functional coatings with adaptive optical response.<br/><br/>The education and outreach components of this project are directly integrated with its research investigations. The PI will lead a simulation-to-3D-printing workshop for high-school students in Bloomington, Indiana, where they will become familiar with applications of computing tools and fabrication techniques while learning about the design of matter at the nanoscale. The PI's team will design web-based science gateways to bring the computational methods developed in this project to classrooms in and outside of Indiana University, and facilitate the learning of underrepresented students at Minority-Serving Institutions. The PI is in a unique position to play a pivotal role in the design and implementation of a brand-new undergraduate program focused on nanoscale engineering that will significantly impact Indiana University, as it will train a diverse pool of undergraduate students to develop advances in nanotechnology.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research and education to identify the fundamental mechanisms of engineering adaptive shape control in soft-matter-based nanoparticles. Harnessing the adaptability of biological materials in synthetic matter is one of the biggest challenges in materials engineering. The PI is deeply inspired by biology, where viral capsomeres self-assemble into rods and spheres which display shape adaptation, and where proteins selectively bind to viruses that exhibit unique combinations of surface pattern and shape. With such instances in mind, in this project, the PI will connect the surface patterning to mechanistic behavior for nanoparticles made from charged soft materials, such as virus-like nanocontainers, micellar vesicles, and polymeric nanomembranes. The PI's research team will investigate how surface charge and elasticity patterns affect the overall shape of these nanoparticles, and how these patterns control the timescales of shape-switching and aggregation of nanoparticles in physiological conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations will be used to probe surface charge and elasticity patterns that 1) enable nanoparticle shape adaptation, and 2) control real-time shape-switching and assembly of nanoparticles into higher-order nanostructures.<br/><br/>The PI will develop molecular dynamics methods that are uniquely capable of connecting the smaller length-scale effects of counterion condensation on nanoparticle surfaces to the larger length-scale aggregation behavior of nanoparticles. Based on this multiscale information, this research will produce maps that link surface patterns to equilibrium and dynamical properties of the shapes of virus-like nanoparticles and polymeric nanomembranes for a wide range of environmental conditions. These maps will help guide the design of deformable nanoparticles that can actively change shape and associated functionalities, advancing the current capabilities for engineering biomimetic nanocontainers for applications in targeted drug-delivery. This research will also expand the synthetic capabilities of designing reconfigurable materials via the self-assembly of deformable nanoscale building blocks.<br/><br/>This project will involve graduate students, undergraduate students, and a diverse online community of users in active research via hands-on experiences and research-based courses, workshops, and online computing platforms. The PI will develop a simulation-to-3D-printing workshop and web-based science gateways that will provide a sophisticated, user-friendly environment to engage with the simulations of nanoparticles. These platforms will facilitate access of the educational and research materials to a broad group of students and educators, including those at Minority-Serving Institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications range from manipulating thermal and electronic transport in solids to controlling information propagation in a quantum network that behaves like an interacting quantum system. Non-equilibrium dynamics is however not very well-understood in certain quantum materials, especially for those with strong interactions between constituents. To gain precise knowledge on the quantum dynamics of interest, a quantum material with precise local probes and control is highly desired. This CAREER award supports an experimental research and education program to assemble a designer quantum material for the exploration of elusive non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. The proposed material consists of an array of cold neutral atoms, each cooled to its quantum mechanical ground state, and controlled by novel potentials formed by optical, phononic and nanophotonic lattices to mimic various types of quantum materials. The project aims at inducing and probing a variety of quantum dynamical phenomena not previously realized. Success in this project will lead to advancement in controlling atomic quantum materials and in deeper understanding of quantum many-body and statistical physics. Due to broad experimental techniques involved in this research program, the project will provide solid research training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Purdue Physics and Astronomy Outreach office, the project will initiate a secondary-grade outreach program aimed at improving the learning capital and STEM career orientation of underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>This CAREER award supports an experimental research and education program to explore non-equilibrium dynamics in an atomic quantum gas using a state-of-the-art cold atom toolbox for optical, phononic, and nanophotonic lattice engineering. One thrust of this CAREER project is probing quantum critical dynamics of an atomic quantum gas in an optical lattice. In particular, the PI will employ a new experimental scheme to access a superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum critical point, enabling various ways to explore critical thermodynamics and transport problems that have remained elusive to date. Furthermore, the PI will explore quasiparticle control to engineer a phononic band gap crystal in a superfluid quantum gas that can inhibit phonon transport, just as electronic band gaps do to electrons in solid state crystals. It can be engineered to manipulate thermal and entropy transport in a superfluid sample. The PI will perform dynamical control of the phononic crystals, therefore allowing for the exploration of phononic analogues of electrodynamics phenomena. For a long-term goal of this CAREER project on probing novel quantum dynamics, the PI will aim at further integrating ultracold atoms with nanophotonic lattices to form a designer hybrid material, where the atom-surface Casimir-Polder interaction provides a deep subwavelength lattice potential for entering new regimes of quantum dynamics. Success in this project will advance our knowledge in understanding quantum critical dynamics, provide valuable insights to quantum transport in phononic bandgap materials, and potentially lead to the observation of unexpected new quantum phenomena with a designer hybrid quantum material. The broad experimental techniques involved in this research program will provide solid research training for both graduate and undergraduate students.

Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates a number of biological processes, such as onset of many diseases and plant signaling. While it has been found extensive, at any given time only a small percentage of phosphorylated proteins may change their phosphorylation status in response to a particular cellular event, which makes it extremely challenging for detection and quantitative measurement of phosphorylated proteins of relevant. The proposed proteomic platform aims at a versatile and cost-effective analytical tool. The technique will be applied to identify important phosphoproteins involved in osmosis, water, temperature, cold, and nutrient deficiency stress in Arabidopsis. In addition to providing interdisciplinary learning experience to both graduate and undergraduate students, the PIs also plan to promote teaching, training, learning, and discovery through the development of a new summer undergraduate lab course to engage students in a genuine research project that emphasizes the utilization of modern analytical methods and to enhance students' academic opportunities. <br/><br/>The project will develop a novel proteomic platform that addresses two major analytical questions related to large-scale protein phosphorylation analyses: how to quantitatively visualize and detect phosphorylated proteins in a complex sample and how to identify phosphoproteins of interest and their sites of phosphorylation. The core of the platform is novel chemical reagents that are multi-functionalized for high specificity and selectivity toward phosphoproteins in complex biological samples such as whole cell extracts. The platform will allow for the selection of phosphoproteins of interest that are further subjected to tandem mass spectrometry to get sequencing information and sites of phosphorylation.  The technique seeks to provide researchers with a useful technique for routine phosphorylation analyses. Major applications include quantitative measurement of phosphorylation, assays of kinase and phosphatase activity, screening for kinase/phosphatase inhibition, and detection of in vivo phosphorylation in different cellular states."

Iyengar of Indiana University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program.  Many problems at the forefront of energy, environmental and biological research demand the quantum mechanical treatment of electrons and nuclei. But the detailed quantum description of such problems is much too complex even in today?s high performance computing environment. This is because the computational complexity in these problems grows exponentially with system size, which makes them intractable.  Iyengar and his research group are developing new computational methods to address these issues. These methods are poised to have major impact on the study of a wide class of problems in biological enzymes, atmospheric chemistry and materials science including study of hydrogen transfer in polymer electrolyte fuel cells.  The methods are at the forefront of modern computational quantum chemistry and chemical physics. Hence students in the PI's group have the opportunity to learn and develop new theoretical methods and apply these methods to important practical problems. The results, involving computer codes as well as novel scientific ideas are widely disseminated to the scientific community. Specifically, the computer programs when completed will appear as part of the NSF-funded SEAGrid science gateway. In addition, the PI continues to initiate participation and mentoring of freshman by chemistry faculty. The PI further envisions homogenizing the chemistry curriculum by developing student directed web-based learning methods to connect the sub-disciplines of chemistry and achieve a continuous rather than discrete education of undergraduates. <br/><br/>Computing accurate classical trajectories and potential surfaces in agreement with high levels of electronic structure for complex chemical systems is a major challenge in computational chemistry and chemical physics.   Iyengar and co-workers are making contributions in this area, including the development of on-the-fly molecular dynamics methods that   allow accurate treatment of electronic structure at the MP2 and Coupled Cluster level, using methods that scale like DFT. Furthermore, they are computing potential surfaces for quantum-mechanical nuclear degrees of freedom that are in good agreement with higher levels of electronic structure methods such as MP2 and Coupled Cluster, at computational costs comparable to DFT. While ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods are appealing because they do not need an a priori fitted potential surface, this advantage is normally precluded since on-the-fly evaluation of potential and forces is a strong computational constraint. Hence most implementations of AIMD are limited to density functional theoretic (DFT) treatment of electronic structure.  The goal of this project is to alleviate this computational constraint and make AIMD more routinely and broadly applicable using efficient methods that allow higher levels of electronic structure, post-Hartree-Fock accuracy. Specifically, the proposal deals with (a) the development of new methods to efficiently compute on-the-fly electronic structure for AIMD and Car-Parrinello-like methods in agreement with MP2, Coupled Cluster and other post-Hartree-Fock methods, (b) the computation of potential surfaces using these approaches to facilitate on-the-fly quantum dynamics. Chemical problems to be studied include, (i) the study conformation dynamics and vibrational properties of protonated water clusters, and (ii) the determination of accurate potential surfaces for reaction paths and quantum wave packet dynamics studies on hydrogen transfer reactions involved in the oxidation pathways of hydroxyl-isoprene, which is a biogenic volatile organic compound."

Graphene and other layered materials have the potential to improve applications ranging from high-efficiency solar cells to precision biosensors. Controlling surface chemistry represents a useful means of affecting properties such as conductivity and solubility to help reach these aims. However, in practice this control has been difficult to achieve. Professor Claridge's group takes a bioinspired approach to solving both problems using one of nature's chosen building blocks for controlling interface chemistry:  fat molecules (lipids). The educational component of this program uses campus dining facilities as context-rich learning environments for first-year general chemistry students and the campus community. <br/> <br/>The proposed research uses an unconventional self-assembly strategy based on lipids reoriented into a 'sitting' geometry.

The new surface chemistry simultaneously controls ligand-substrate electronic coupling and ligand-solvent interactions important for material solubility and processability.  For semiconductor nanocrystals, rigorous control of ligand chemistry has proven to be a key enabler in technological applications; establishing similar control over layered material surface chemistry is expected to provide similar benefits.

In addition, there are several proposals to use controlled atoms or ions in complex arrangements to manipulate properties of laser light. Studies of this type are being aggressively pursued in Europe and Asia, and the ability of the US to compete in this arena could be crucial for several technologies. This project will attempt to better simulate several common processes in quantum computers and/or simulators that are often treated in an approximate manner; the goal is to predict which properties are important for a successful quantum computer. In addition, the group will explore the role that cooperative affects among atoms play in these systems and whether the many interactions lead to qualitatively different outcomes. The basic understanding of these systems is difficult; and will require the development of new tools that could be of widespread utility. Because the operation of quantum computers or simulators depends on fragile quantum processes, it is important to understand how the atoms or ions and the lasers interact at a fine level of detail. Even small effects can accumulate over the many atoms or ions and lead to failure. Thus, a major drive of this project is to reduce the approximations in order to reliably predict how these machines will operate.<br/><br/>The goal of the projects in this proposal is to understand how small, but possibly important, effects will limit the effectiveness of quantum computers, will control how light is manipulated through the interaction with patterned arrays of atoms, or will display interesting collective phenomena due to the long range dipole-dipole interaction between atoms. One set of projects addresses how the interaction of light with atoms in quantum computers can lead to entanglement of the center of mass motion of the atom with its internal states, which can be a source of decoherence; this entanglement is caused by the momentum kick of photon absorption and/or emission. A second set of projects simulates, at a more detailed level than performed to date, how a patterned array of atoms can manipulate, for example, the direction of a light beam; for example, each photon reflecting from the array must give a momentum kick but whether the kick is coherently or is incoherently spread over several atoms has not been investigated. A last group of projects is proposed to understand basic physics processes that arise when many atoms interact with light; as an example, many atom coherences can develop within the ground state when it has angular momentum greater than zero. The overarching goal for all projects is to investigate complex quantum phenomena involving many particles where the interaction between them is through the retarded and quantized electromagnetic field. Another interest is in understanding how complex behavior can emerge from simple interactions and, thus, could be of wide interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will provide a high quality program of speakers in the area of permutation patterns with opportunities for collaboration between junior and senior researchers, as well as between participants from around the world. Each year the conference will feature two plenary one-hour speakers and a number of contributed talks, each thirty minutes long. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problems in the field. This award supports travel to the conference by students and early career mathematicians from the United States. This conference is part of a series of annual conferences devoted to the area of permutation patterns. Ever since the first conference in 2003, which was hosted by the University of Otago in New Zealand, it has been held every year at different institutions around the world: in North America, Europe, and Australasia.<br/><br/>The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems. Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research areas in mathematics and computer science.

The general motivating principle behind the work is that such events, especially when intimately tied to human mobility, generally display robust patterning, such that significant deviations from the typical patterns, either on an individual or collective level, are cause for suspicion and should be treated as potentially dangerous. Thus, this project will better enable authorities to quickly determine when threatening situations arise, so that they can react to them rapidly, mitigating potentially devastating consequences.  To achieve this overarching objective, several sub-objectives will be met: 1) constructing models to integrate disparate datasets on human events at varying levels of granularity, from individual-based to neighborhood-based to region-based; 2) developing a framework that ties this integrated data together with models of human mobility; 3) creating methods for detecting sudden changes within the data given the framework, at varying scales, including individuals, groups of individuals, or spatial regions. <br/><br/>This project will construct a framework for analyzing human spatio-temporal event data arising from heterogeneous sources, based on the mathematics of stochastic point processes, but specifically tailored to represent events whose underlying structure is intimately tied to human mobility. Several ideas will be united in this framework, such that the resulting algorithms are able to identify anomalous behavior or events that may represent ongoing or emerging threats. First, new methods will be explored for pre-processing high frequency human mobility data -- eg., gps trace data -- to reduce dimensionality and better fit within the marked point process framework. Next, new classes of marked point processes will be developed that are better able to handle the detailed geometric structure often underlying spatial human event data, given the regularity of human motion upon which such events are often layered; high-order Hawkes processes geometrically embedding human mobility motifs are proposed specifically for this task. New methods will be developed for clustering data subject to these point processes at varying levels of abstraction and physical relevance, from individuals, to linked social groups, to neighborhoods, in order to better identify geographic regions or subsets of individuals that may be displaying or reacting to anomalous behavior. To go along with this, new ways will be developed to quickly detect anomalies within the data as compared to the expected point process through goodness of fit measures, again at differing levels of clustering; proposed here is a Bayesian method to detect emerging patterns for even very limited datasets using transfer learning. The end result with be a suite of tools that are all individually useful, and that combined will serve as a powerful new method of organizing and analyzing large datasets of human events to detect threatening behavior."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award supports the US groups involved in the XENON1T dark matter search program at the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) underground laboratory.<br/><br/>The XENON project continues to captivate the imagination of the public. This is evidenced, for example, by several TV shows such as ""The Big Bang Theory"", which on several occasions featured XENON plots and results. Public interest in science is encouraged through talks and outreach activities. XENON1T will play a significant role in solving the dark matter puzzle, by either detecting WIMPs, or putting them under immense pressure as viable dark matter candidates. In addressing this fundamental physics problem, these awards will engage many undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers, exposing them to a variety of subjects in physics and cosmology, and training them in state-of-the-art technologies, thus preparing to become future leaders in the field. Finally, the instrumentation and techniques used in XENON are relevant to a wide range of applications, from areas in homeland security and medical imaging, to the analysis and statistical treatment of large data sets.<br/><br/>The program for the next four years will focus on the continued operation of the XENON1T experiment and its science data analysis. The international XENON Collaboration of 130 scientists continues to be led by the PI at Columbia University with key roles served by US members both in the management of the experiment and its scientific program. XENON1T uses the largest liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) built to-date, with 2 tonnes active Xe target, and the highest sensitivity to dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), at the level of 2  10^-47 cm^2 for 40 GeV WIMPs.

Model theory develops various ways of measuring the complexity of a class of functions or sets, one of which is called Vapnik-Chervonenkis (or VC) dimension and was independently discovered by researchers in statistical learning theory in the 1970's.  One part of the project is studying the fine structure of systems with finite VC dimension. A related measure of the complexity of a class of sets is called stability and another aspect of the project is using the model-theoretic understanding of stable systems to compute the equations  satisfied by special functions such as the exponential function.  Describing the symmetries of spaces and systems is a pervasive aspect of the research which ties together its various components.<br/><br/>The project has four interrelated aspects, (i) stability theory and theories without the independence property, (ii) topological dynamics, model theory, and pseudo-finite groups, (iii) tame theories of differential fields, (iv) Ax-Lindemann for semiabelian families and differential Galois theory. At the abstract level model theory is about the classification of first order theories, and part (i) is firmly of this nature. The methods and results obtained in ""pure"" model theory are often mathematically meaningful in concrete contexts, leading to new interrelations with other areas of mathematics. In particular in (iv) the PI will study transcendence properties of ""exponential"" functions relative to certain families of commutative algebraic groups, making use of a certain Galois theory of differential equations which is given by constructions in stability-theory (part of model theory). The project also connects to and impacts on topological dynamics, and also potentially and indirectly combinatorics (via the study of certain measures on definable sets in theories without independence property)."

The project also explores the effect of atomic imperfections in the semiconductors on the movement of free electrical charge. This program also links the research with the educational goal of increasing learning opportunities for students of all ages, inside and outside the traditional classroom.

Lesson plans are designed and experimental demonstrations of basic optical properties of matter are built for the middle-school summer camp ?Physics Inside Out? at Purdue. To maximize impact at the high-school level, the activities engage teachers in summer research.

The innovative approach employs an emergent optoelectronic material, the wurtzite phase of Sc-Al-nitride that is lattice-matched to GaN, to mitigate strain-related issues that have impeded progress of nitride optoelectronics into the infrared so far. The research effort is interdisciplinary and involves material design and growth, plus structural and optical characterization. Polar and nonpolar ScAlN/GaN heterostructures are designed using extensive band-structure calculations. To achieve maximum material purity and monolayer-control of the atomic structure, the Sc-containing materials are grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on high quality quasi-bulk GaN substrates. The decisive task is to identify the epitaxial growth conditions that satisfy the most stringent requirements imposed by near-infrared optical processes. In order to correlate microstructure with optical and electronic properties, the structure of the semiconductor materials is comprehensively characterized with high-resolution x-ray diffraction, advanced transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography. The band structure of the materials is probed experimentally with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and photoluminescence. The growth of these emergent materials advances the state-of-the-art in transition-metal nitride epitaxy. Uncharted mechanisms of material growth on polar and non-polar GaN substrates are scrutinized. This research also contributes to the knowledge base of the physics of infrared optical transitions.

Of great importance to this project is the development of a basic science understanding of the effect of processing parameters on ceramic materials with low interfacial resistance, stable mechanical contacts, and low bulk and interfacial porosity. This knowledge will help battery researchers find better ways to fabricate safe high performance cells. Modeling, simulation, advanced processing science, and characterization techniques are integrated to identify material and interface combinations that are the best in terms of being commercially accessible, high performing and reliable. This work provides the basic science foundation to design the next generation solid-state batteries and enables the rational integration of ceramic materials of complementary multifunctional properties for applications that go well beyond energy storage devices of higher energy densities and longer lifespans, such as those observed in fuel cells, super capacitors, reprogrammable sensors and electronics. Graduate student researchers involved in this project are gaining valuable experience by spending their summers learning and performing experiments on electrochemistry and battery materials at Technion. The concepts and tools developed herein are disseminated via nanoHUB, peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of the American Ceramic Society, and undergraduate courses and research activities held at both institutions. The battery science and engineering gained by students provides an ideal stepping-stone for the development advanced energy storage materials and devices. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The processing conditions that control the formation of structurally stable 2D interfacial phases that maximize the conductivity, ionic diffusivity, and phase stability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are being explored. The goal is to gain a fundamental understanding on the formation of disordered, ionically conductive, but electronically insulating charged complexions at the interface between cathode and solid-state electrolyte phases. In particular, a Li3PO4 model electrolyte and a series of model LIB cathode materials: LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LiMn2O4 are being studied. This represents a significant advance in the area of design of the next generation of all solid state batteries, where: modeling and simulation are used to predict the formation and conditions of stability of favorable heterostructural interfacial complexions; sintering experiments are combined with high-resolution electron microscopy to create and characterize 2D and 3D layered systems; and electrochemical characterization is used to extract the interfacial components of the impedance spectra and differentiate the different bulk and interfacial contributions for each of the processed configurations. The findings of this project extend to solid oxide fuel cells, high temperature ceramic gas sensors, and polycrystalline thermoelectrics."

The molecules in this research absorb light strongly and are potentially useful for devices such as solar cells.  In order to use them in solar energy conversion devices, the molecules have to be closely packed together and the packing greatly influences how energy is transferred from one molecule to the other. These factors determine the efficiency of the solar cell.  By tracking how energy moves in molecular assemblies with different packing, this work is resolving mechanisms that control the speed and distance of energy migration and providing guidelines for designing structures for efficient solar energy harvesting.  To achieve these goals, microscopy techniques are being developed to record fast energy transfer events with a resolution of 100 femtoseconds (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second) and to image energy migration distance with a resolution of 20 nanometers (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter).  Dr. Huang is developing a new instructional model that integrates active learning with scientific writing aimed at better teaching abstract concepts in physical chemistry. In particular, solar energy applications in this award are being developed into demonstrations to illustrate key concepts in quantum mechanics.  Writing assignments of these demonstrations are being utilized to promote high-level cognitive understanding of abstract concepts.  The researchers are also developing a scientific outreach program to bring state-of-the-art solar energy research to high schools in Northwest Indiana.  <br/><br/>The ultrafast nanoscopy methods being developed in this project directly image exciton transport across multiple length and time scales to elucidate coherent and incoherent energy transfer pathways in molecular assemblies.  Exciton populations and dynamics following photoexcitation are being mapped with simultaneous < 100 fs temporal resolution and ~20 nm spatial precision. These measurements provide first-of-a-kind visualization of the spatial extent of coherent transport. Two model molecular aggregates are employed to systematically probe energy transfer in the intermediate coupling regimes. Linear H aggregates serve as model 1D excitonic quantum wires in which long-range wavelike coherent transport is expected. Tubular aggregates are employed to elucidate exciton transport as a function of dimensionality. Building on results from the model systems, the long-term goal of controlling transport in supramolecular assemblies is achieved by modulating both short- and long-range intermolecular coupling.  The research and educational activities are integrated to educate the next generation of solar energy researchers at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels."

Missing data often limits the ability to extract useful information from these sources (e.g., early diagnosis). The goal of this project is to leverage the fact that missing information sometimes satisfies mathematical or physical principles to develop innovative model-based imputation approaches, combining models and efficient privacy-preserving learning techniques in large EHR datasets. Computationally efficient algorithms will be developed to train numerical models while preserving patient privacy, and the feasibility and practical usefulness of these approaches will be demonstrated at a scale that has not yet been addressed in the literature. The approaches for predictive numerical models developed for this project can be applied broadly in various fields. Additional project goals include development of infrastructure for research and education through freely available, open-source software libraries. This project will also provide invaluable multi-disciplinary skills to undergraduate and graduate students. Both research and outreach efforts focus on increasing the participation of women, people with disabilities, and of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The team will develop novel regularization approaches through numerical models, i.e., optimally trained models able to suggest distributions of missing data based on the underlying physics. For EHRs characterizing cardiovascular function, lumped parameter hemodynamic models offer an ideal regularizer. Parameter estimation for these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and therefore incompatible with fast application to large EHR collections. Additionally, optimally trained numerical models of the cardiovascular system can be thought as a type of query, rising issues of patient privacy. The proposed research tackles these issues through: (1) Acquisition and analysis of a large heart failure EHR dataset. (2) Development of privacy-preserving variational inference for hemodynamic models, enhanced using homotopy-based optimization. (3) Implementation and extensive testing of novel imputation approaches for missing data, combining uncertainty quantification and numerical models.

The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to understand certain properties of the physical world such as angles, distances and properties of certain shapes. Differential geometry was developed to use the tools of calculus to understand the geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature of space by matter as predicted by general relativity, or the properties of soap bubbles (which turn out to be related to the equations describing black holes). In the same way that Descartes realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential equations.  The research in this project involves disparate problems from geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by mathematical analysis in their study.   In addition to mathematical investigations, the PI will be organizing a summer residential STEM program in cooperation with the Chicago Pre-College Science and Engineering Program, and supported by the Notre Dame TRiO Program.  This will be a two-week program run in the summers of 2019 and 2020 for high school students from Chicago Public Schools, many of whom will be first-generation college students.  The program will run for two weeks, and will include mathematics instruction and project-based learning <br/> <br/>There are two main mathematical themes supported by this award. Poincare-Einstein manifolds are generalizations of the Poincare ball model of hyperbolic space.  They are complete manifolds satisfying the Einstein condition (with negative Einstein constant) which can be compactified by conformally changing the metric that vanishes at an appropriate rate at infinity.  They arise in several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics; for example, in in the Fefferman-Graham theory of conformal invariants and in the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. One area of investigation supported by this award is the fundamental question of existence:  given a manifold with boundary and a conformal class of metrics on the boundary, can one construct a Poincare-Einstein metric whose compactification induces the given conformal class on the boundary?  In joint work with Q. Han and S. Stolz, the PI is developing new tools to detect obstructions to existence based on the topology and geometry of the boundary. On the other hand, in work with G. Szekelyhidi the PI was able to prove local existence of solutions (i.e., in a neighborhood of infinity). Another area of research with connections to physics is the PI's ongoing work with J. Streets and C. Kelleher on the variational properties of the Yang-Mills functional in four dimensions.  Building on the recent work, which gave a new sharp lower bound for minimizing solutions, the PI will investigate the behavior of solutions with large Morse index.  The PI will prove a lower bound for the energy depending (in a precise way) on the index of the solution and the geometry of the base manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The latter should be seen as a way to define an analysis at the path level, and leads to deep and useful results concerning stochastic differential equations. This project is also concerned with the theory of regularity structures, which is a recent breakthrough allowing to define a wide range of singular stochastic systems previously out of reach.  The regularity structures theory also gives an almost deterministic point of view on stochastic calculus, as opposed to the traditional approach which is very probabilistic in essence. The current project should be seen as a contribution in the areas mentioned above. A combination of rough paths, regularity structures and Malliavin calculus techniques will be used to analyze some physically relevant models such as the continuous parabolic Anderson model in rough environments. Thanks to those fundamental techniques, the PI will also study algebraic and geometric aspects of 2-d signatures with some data analysis applications in mind. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/><br/>This project is concerned with relevant models in theoretical physics and image processing. A significant portion of the proposal is devoted to localization properties of the parabolic Anderson model, and a special emphasis is also put on the signature method for random fields.

(3) Path confinement for the continuous polymer measure. (4) 2-d signatures and failure identification. The PI plans to develop probabilistic, geometric, and analytic methods and ideas that will lead to a deeper understanding of the qualitative and quantitative of the aforementioned systems.

The high temperature strength of these superalloys has recently been observed to be controlled by intricate atomistic-level processes that are not well understood due to the nature of the superalloy chemistry. The basic research enabled by this CAREER award will uncover the fundamental, atomistic-level processes governing high temperature strength in model metallic materials. Computational methods and theory will be developed to provide predictive capability of these atomistic processes, and advanced characterization methods will verify those predictions. This research will enable higher strength superalloys, which could increase turbine engine efficiencies and power while decreasing pollution emissions. The fundamental insights garnered from this program will be applicable to a wide range of ceramic, metallic, and semiconductor materials used across numerous industries and could enable new technologies. Outreach efforts as part of this program will include mentoring of local High School students and materials engineering-related learning module development and dissemination.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Despite knowledge of solute segregation to stacking faults in crystalline materials, this phenomenon has yet to be utilized as a strengthening mechanism in most structural alloy materials. Recent works in the literature and by the PI have suggested that complex dislocation interactions and minute composition differences in Ni-based superalloys control the solute segregation behavior at stacking faults, and that this segregation behavior can be utilized to increase the high temperature creep strength in Ni-based superalloys. However, due to the complex compositions in advanced superalloys the driving forces governing solute segregation are not well understood. The basic research supported by this CAREER award seeks to uncover the fundamental thermodynamic driving forces for solute segregation to stacking faults in simple alloy compositions. The objective of this work is then to predict and quantify solute segregation at stacking faults during high temperature deformation in Ni-based superalloy compositions in order to utilize Suzuki segregation to further strengthen this important class of structural materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is nearly 100 years since American Astronomer Edwin Hubble first showed that galaxies are island universes, containing of billions of stars.  The investigators seek to understand how galaxies form and change over time. Their goal is identifying the star formation processes that produced the wide variety of galaxies observed.  The investigators have selected for special study a set of nearby, gas-rich, galaxies.  These galaxies were found with the Arecibo radio telescope.  These galaxies contain large amounts of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas, the raw ingredient of new generations of stars.  Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate students who work on the project will receive professional development and training in scientific research, technical and mathematical methods, image processing and analysis, and computer programming.<br/><br/>The ALFALFA survey is a HI survey aimed at constructing a statistically-complete census of neutral hydrogen gas in the local universe. ALFALFA covers 7000 square degrees of sky and has cataloged 30,000 objects.  This project aims to measure the optical properties of two specific types of ALFALFA sources: Ultra-Compact High Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs), which are neutral hydrogen gas clouds with properties that make them good candidates for nearby low-mass galaxies, and ""Almost-Dark"" galaxies, which are HI sources with a wider range of possible distances and masses.  Both classes of objects have no clear optical counterpart in existing catalogs, so the objective is to detect and characterize the optical emission from these objects in order to better understand their properties and evolutionary state. To accomplish this objective, the investigator and her students will obtain and analyze deep, wide-field, optical imaging with the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope and One Degree Imager (ODI) of a well-defined sample of UCHVCs and Almost-Dark galaxies chosen from ALFALFA.  The observations will be used to investigate the properties of the UCHVC and Almost-Dark samples and address important questions about how galaxies with neutral gas form and evolve. These questions include: What implications do the UCHVCs have for the ``missing satellites problem''?  What fraction of the UCHVCs have detectable stellar populations?  Are there correlations between the galaxies' environments and locations within the Local Volume and their properties (e.g., the presence or absence of ongoing star formation, their evolutionary phase)?  What is the nature of the Almost-Dark galaxies, and how do their properties differ from ``normal'' galaxies in optical catalogs?  What do the Almost-Dark objects reveal about how star formation takes place in galaxies at the extreme end of the HI mass to optical luminosity regime?  The objects in the UCHVCs sample can also be used to help characterize the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation down to very low galaxy masses (less than ten million solar masses) and to probe the chemical evolution of the Universe.<br/><br/>The investigator has made major commitments to the support and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, and to the training of students in research.  The investigator will also work with consultants at the Indiana University Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning to revise a large introductory astronomy course for non-majors.  The investigator will use the data taken with optical and radio telescopes in a course to pique student's interest, help illustrate the concepts being taught, and show concrete examples of how modern research is done in astronomy.  Finally, the investigator will work on advancing science outreach and education through her membership on the Board of Directors of the Maria Mitchell Association, a non-profit research, education, and outreach organization that promotes the legacy of America's first female professional astronomer."

Bulk metals often become mechanically softer after exposure to high temperatures; one exception to this rule is materials that are designed to age harden. Aluminum alloys are the classical example of age hardening, where after heating the strength of the aluminum alloy increases due to local re-arrangements of impurity atoms that lead to an internal nanoscale network of strengthening particles. Stronger materials benefit society on several levels; in particular they allow us to develop lighter weight structures that carry the same loads (i.e. more fuel efficient cars, lower materials costs in bridges, or higher performance in aerospace applications).  Ultra-strong metals often use many closely spaced nanoscale particles within the metal to increase strength, but often these particles grow upon exposure to high temperatures and their relative spacing increases, which decreases  strength.  A new method is proposed in this study to strengthen metals that relies upon forming layers of alternating two different metals which creates a material with many internal interfaces.  By confining the strengthening particles to nanoscale slabs the maximum particle growth will be constrained, and at the same time that the particle-to-particle spacing increases the interface-to-particle spacing decreases, resulting in retained strength and thermal stability.  The students working on this project will also design classroom materials and accompanying lesson plans for middle school science classrooms to help teachers provide students engaging activities that fulfill Indiana learning standards while teaching college students how to effectively support local educational outreach.<br/><br/><br/>Technical description<br/><br/>Annealing precipitate-strengthened metals increases the spacing between second phase particles, and the structure will soften.   By adding second phase precipitates within layers, annealing will change both the particle-particle and particle-interface spacing.  This work will examine the effects of two dimensional confinement on precipitation of Cr particles within a metastable Cr-Cu system.  As precipitation occurs within the FCC layer, the nanolaminates with precipitates are expected to have a higher strength than single phase laminates.  During annealing the spacing between the particles may increase, but the distance between the particles and the Cu-Cr interfaces will decrease as the precipitates grow.  This provides a strengthening mechanism that should lead to increases in strength after annealing, rather than decreasing strength after annealing, and is possible only due to the two dimensional architecture of these materials.  The system should also be resistant to over-aging, adding a level of thermal stability not possible in 3D architectures.  However, the confined layer slip mechanism of strengthening relies on dislocation core spreading and shear at the FCC/BCC interface; it must also be determined if precipitates at interfaces, rather than in the layer, accentuate or attenuate strength enhancements.  The goal of this proposal is to test and verify the possible strengthening mechanisms, determine if the nanoscale features of planar systems provides additive synergistic strengthening with other hardening mechanisms (i.e. are precipitation hardening, confined layer slip, and solid solution hardening additive in 2D confined systems?), and develop strengthening models for this 2D architecture that will predict the strength of new metallic multilayer alloy structures that strengthen when annealed and exhibit smaller decreases in strength at elevated temperatures than other nano-featured metals.  This work is motivated in part from recent molecular dynamics simulations that suggested nanolaminate strength increases as precipitate size increases, providing a new direction in strengthening metallic systems for use under elevated temperatures and or subjected to thermal conditions that would traditionally degrade their strength."

This is a new tool to investigate local, temporal release of high-value, but difficult to study biological analytes. The developed instrumentation is used to probe local distribution and release of neurotransmitters in differentiated PC12 cells as well as the transient ion concentration in epithelial wound models. Broader impacts focus on two specific aims. The first aim is the development of new ways to teach analytical chemistry at the graduate and undergraduate level. This includes the inclusion of instrument building (3D printer construction) and development of a regional graduate analytical chemistry course between Indiana University, Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame. The second aim is to make full use of outreach activities with the student Electrochemical Society (ECS) chapter at Indiana University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Ren is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University.  He and his coworkers are developing new classes of metal alkynyl complexes with interesting photochemical properties.  The goal of this research is to establish a unique family of donor-metal-alkynyl-acceptor complexes based on earth abundant metals, to study how electrons move within these molecules under sunlight, and to learn how to control such electron movement. This study may provide clues on how to improve molecular photovoltaic systems for the conversion of solar energy into electricity using earth abundant materials.  The project involves both organic and inorganic syntheses and ultrafast spectroscopy, which provides broad training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Professor Ren's group is also actively engaging students underrepresented in science, and plays a significant role in bringing the state of arts equipment to the K-12 students in the rural areas of Indiana by enhancing their hands-on laboratory experience. This research and education program promotes US competitiveness through an exploration of sustainable systems for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and molecular electronic devices.<br/><br/>Transition metal acetylide compounds have been employed in a number of technologically important areas including photovoltaics, photo-catalysis and molecular electronic devices. The current project begins with the preparation of the symmetric and unsymmetric bis-alkynyl metal complexes supported by C-substituted cyclams. A special focus of the synthetic effort is the donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) dyads, where D and A are respectively alkynyls capped with appropriate electron donor and acceptor, and B is the M(cyclam) unit. Besides the establishment of molecular geometry through single crystal X-ray diffraction, the degree of donor-acceptor interaction and its impact on redox and photophysical properties is assessed using voltammetric, spectroelectrochemical and steady-state emission spectroscopic techniques. Through the collaboration with both colleagues at Purdue and elsewhere, the investigators explore the attenuation of photoinduced electron transfer within the D-B-A dyad using both pump-probe and pump-pump-probe techniques. The transformative nature of the project lies in the promise of replacing precious metals in metal-alkynyl based materials with earth abundant 3d metals and discovering new electronic and optoelectronic properties. Professor Ren is striving to broaden the participation in chemical research enterprise by underrepresented groups on multiple levels from incoming freshman to junior faculty, and has maintained a diverse research group. Professor Ren and his coworkers also play an active role in Purdue's Science Express program, especially in introducing new teaching modules that reflect the heightened interest in sustainable chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such material is tin in solder joints: Tin  atoms are able to move around (diffuse) relatively quickly at room temperature in response to changes in their environment. Of particular concern is the formation of long Tin whiskers   in response to stresses normally occuring in microelectronics. Long Tin  filaments can grow spontaneously from surfaces of thin Sn films and can reach lengths of several millimeters. Such whiskers can bridge adjacent contacts and cause short circuits leading to electronic system failures. The question is how to stop them from forming. A new strategy is needed to better understand and specifically to mitigate failure due to whisker growth in Sn films.  In particular, forming whiskers is only one of the ways in which the atoms in thin Sn films can respond to stresses. This new strategy needs to take into account the contributions of other processes to relaxing stresses in thin films and to learn how to manipulate them to keep whiskers from forming. The goal of this project is to develop models, numerical simulations and critical experiments at the microscopic scale to quantify the different contributions of these processes in these films. <br/><br/>The proposed computational effort is a step forward in reducing the reliance on experimentation to develop new materials or to improve reliability in existing ones.    Achieving this goal for materials design requires the development of new predictive simulation tools and training the next generation work force on the use of these advanced tools. The data and simulation tools developed in this project will be broadly available through the NSF supported nanoHUB.org with open access to the materials community including researchers in industry and academy and educators. Demonstration tools for education will be deployed in nanoHUB.org and integrated in the Engineering curriculum at Purdue and will be accessible for universities and industry everywhere. The work proposed provides an excellent opportunity to train graduate students and undergraduates in the integration of materials science and engineering experimental and computational techniques, in developing cross-disciplinary approaches, and in working as members of a multi-disciplinary international research team. <br/><br/>Techical Abstract<br/><br/>Heterogeneous microstructure-induced stresses that drive stress relaxation are linked to a wide range of failure mechanisms in thin metal films. Whisker and hillock formation are known responses of thin metal films to residual stresses but others include yielding, diffusional and dislocation-mediated creep, grain boundary sliding, cracking, delamination, surface roughening, extrusion-intrusion formation, recrystallization and grain growth. The relative contributions of these multiple operations to stress relaxation frequently switch as stress distributions and microstructures evolve in a dynamic and complex process. <br/>A strategy to better understand their changing contributions and specifically to mitigate failure due to whisker growth in Sn films needs to take into account the contributions of these mechanisms to identify: i) the local conditions under which surface grains form whiskers and influence their rate of growth, and ii) what other mechanisms compete with or accelerate whisker formation and growth. The goal of this project is to develop models, numerical simulations and experiments at the microscopic scale to study deformation-microstructure relationships to relax residual stresses in thin Sn films during cyclic bending and thermal cycling, two configurations where multiple processes operate. We propose to develop a framework with simulations of these simultaneous processes with experiments designed to explore the different contributions of these mechanisms. While the proposed framework could be applied to a variety of thin film systems, Sn films not only display a wide range of phenomena that will demonstrate its capabilities, but will also provide the opportunity to test its usefulness in developing mitigation strategies to inhibit tin whisker formation. <br/><br/>While the understanding of local stress relaxation processes in thin films and small-scale structures has grown significantly over the past decade, a strategy to examine multiple simultaneous processes, such as dislocation generation, recrystallization, creep, and whisker formation, is still developing. The recent observation that, in Sn films, whiskers nucleate and grow along some grain boundaries during thermal cycling and cyclic bending with other dislocation and diffusion processes being evident offers the opportunity to explore this stress-microstructure-deformation space. The numerical simulations and experiments proposed in this effort are a step forward in answering questions, such as where and how do grains nucleate to form whiskers and hillocks, what local conditions affect their rates of growth and how does whisker growth competes or collaborates with other stress relaxation mechanisms."

Such assembled nanocrystals are thought to exhibit synchronized emission.  Perhaps the best way to think of this phenomenon in everyday life is if everyone broke into applause at the end of a concert at exactly the same time, as if on cue.  Such synchronized emission represents a potential source of high brightness photons for the emerging field of quantum information science.  Yet despite this potential, very little is currently understood about the phenomenon.  The work will therefore conduct concerted experimental and theoretical studies with the aim of seeing whether it can be made robust and observable at room temperature.  In the broader impacts part of the project, low cost, portable microscopes, capable of single particle imaging, will be developed for local community educators.  Up to five microscopes will be built and, through collaboration with Notre Dame?s Energy Center, local educators will be trained to use and demonstrate these microscopes to their students.<br/><br/>The production of advanced, non-classical light sources is key to realizing eventual applications of quantum information science.  Single molecules, cold atoms, color centers, nanostructures, and quantum dots have all been explored as sources of deterministic photons.  New quantum communications protocols, however, require even higher brightness sources of entangled photons.  On-demand, superfluorescent photons offer a potential solution.  This project will investigate recently reported superfluorescence in solid state superlattices of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using concerted theoretical and experimental studies.  This first entails developing a microscopic model to describe nanocrystal superfluorescence.  Accompanying experimental studies will focus on establishing the emergence of nanocrystal superlattice superfluorescence through control of superlattice size and shape.  These studies also involve conducting spatially- and temporally-resolved (fs-ps timescale) emission microscopy and spectroscopy measurements on individual nanocrystal superlattices to learn more about superfluorescence dynamics and the influence superlattice electronic/structural disorder has on its robustness.  The ultimate goal of these studies is to realize robust, room temperature superfluorescence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SEHRS is a technique provide unique information about molecules adsorbed on a surface. The success of this work has the potential to impact a wide range of studies, especially the geometry of a molecule adsorbed on a surface differs in complex environments.  It can also make a difference in deep-tissue imaging.  Furthermore, Professors Camden and Svarovsky and their groups also work on ways to reduce the cost of SEHRS spectrometers, making SEHRS accessible to a wide range of researchers and analytical problems. Students working in these two labs have a great opportunity to learn different skills through collaboration. As a way to engage a new and national K-12 audience in outreach efforts, Professors Camden and Svarovsky also plan to work with the University of Notre Dame's Center for STEM Education together and launch a new Citizen Science project called U-Watch. The program will bring the benefits of surface-based spectroscopy research supported by this grant to a broad audience and could identify potentially dangerous levels of contamination, such as uranium, in ground water drinking sources.<br/><br/>In this work, SEHRS is used to provide information that is not available via other techniques. New methods for single-molecule SEHRS are used to probe nanoparticle-adsorbate interactions at the level of single molecules in complex chemical environments.  SEHRS nanoparticles also serve as a platform for near-infrared and short-wave-infrared (SWIR) (0.8-2.5 Pm) sensing, imaging, and authentication. The Notre Dame groups also plan to develop the characterization methods needed to pursue the rational design of SWIR tags and apply them to deep-tissue imaging studies.  A comparison of SEHRS and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) shows that SEHRS can be more sensitive than SERS in certain situations. Lastly, they explore the potential for hand-held, field-portable devices capable of recording SEHRS spectra with continuous-wave lasers. Through the supported research, the groups will demonstrate SEHRS as a powerful and practical analytical approach to ultrasensitive detection, imaging, and the elucidation of surface structure and environment."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This truly unique study covers an enormous range in physical scale, from the smallest observable clouds to clusters of galaxies, to show the real dynamical interaction between the visible galaxies and their surroundings.  Junior researchers and students will learn how to run and to interpret state-of-the-art numerical simulations, and how to carry out data mining on existing observation archives.<br/><br/>The circum-galactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse gas surrounding galaxies that acts as a fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center.  Recent discoveries show that the CGM is dynamic, rapidly evolving, has significant mass, and plays a key role in determining the mass, shape, and star-forming properties of galaxies.  This project applies a new combination of data with models to examine the role of the CGM in galaxy evolution over seven orders of magnitude in physical scale, which is required to truly understand its conditions and kinematics.  The data will be mined from existing archives, and the models will come from a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The rigorous comparison will use a toolkit developed by this team to produce mock datasets from simulations, which can then be analyzed in concert with the real data.  This work should solve several puzzles: 1) although abundant in chemical elements, the dense CGM is not as well-mixed as predicted; 2) galaxies have massive reservoirs of metal-rich gas that should have an extremely short cooling time; 3) the cool CGM is too diffuse to be in pressure equilibrium with a hot galactic corona; and 4) there is just as much cool, neutral gas in the CGM of passive galaxies as in that of star-forming galaxies, so that this gas can be neither fuel for, nor a by-product of, star formation.  This understanding can only be gained by a breakthrough in understanding physics at the scales of the smallest individual clouds that observations can detect, which is not possible except by using multi-scale simulations rigorously coupled to data.  The study will reveal the physical state of CGM gas, constrain the timescales over which CGM clouds evolve, and determine the mass flow rates and total masses moving in and out of galaxies.<br/><br/>These results will be the focus of outreach talks by all team members to the diverse communities in the areas around the different institutions involved.  The project will involve junior scientists in front line research, especially targeting under-represented students, and contributing to mentoring skills amongst the intermediate-level researchers.  It will also support development of a new planetarium show that includes visualized hydro-dynamical simulations of the gas in galaxies."
