Ordered arrays of molecules forming structures known as molecular crystals play an essential role in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, electronics, and defense industries.  In many instances, a given chemical compound may have more than one  crystal structure, a phenomenon known as polymorphism.  A   crystal may also contain impurities, the most important among these being water.   Such structures are referred to as crystal hydrates. The ability of these materials to function in a desired manner may depend on which structure, pure or impure, they form.  If  a  well-engineered molecular crystal converts to  another form or if it absorbs impurities over time., its performance may be seriously degraded.  Such transformations can, for example, cause drugs to fail or insecticides to lose their potency. On the other hand, polymorphism and hydrate formation in molecular crystals are features that can be exploited to enhance the performance of these material.  Utilizing advances in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, the theoretical molecular sciences are currently poised to drive new directions in molecular crystal engineering.  Computational approaches have the potential to highlight potential pitfalls associated with structural and compositional variability before expensive experiments are performed or large investments in manufacturing a particular material are made. With the aim of realizing this potential,  Professors Tuckerman and Delhommelle  propose to create new computational approaches and software components for rapidly predicting polymorphic structures in molecular crystals and understanding the transitions between structures.    Broad dissemination of these tools and their incorporation into the materials design and engineering processes will affect a reduction in time between concept and realization of crystal systems with desired optimal properties and will catalyze the creation of new course materials for enhancing STEM education. <br/><br/>The basic properties of organic molecular materials in the solid state are often strongly influenced by the details of their crystal structures and the existence of polymorphs and/or impurities such as water. Experimental determination of these structures is costly and time-consuming, which places increased importance on the role of theory and computation and the leveraging of advances in high-performance computing machine learning methods. The aim of this project is to develop a suite of new methods and software tools for the prediction of organic molecular crystal structures, including multiple polymorphs, elucidation of the mechanisms and thermodynamics of polymorphic and solid-liquid phase transitions, and the mapping of favored locations for water molecules in stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric crystal hydrates. The proposed developments bring together techniques of topological analysis, machine learning, enhanced molecular dynamics, thermodynamics, and solvation theories. The main goals of the project are (1) to create a topological theory for crystal structure generation based on solely on molecular order parameters, thus bypassing the need to parameterize an intermolecular interaction model, (2) to develop new entropy- and path-based collective variables, aided by machine learning , for studying polymorphic transitions via state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques, and (3) to devise new theoretical and computational techniques for mapping the locations of water molecules in non-stoichiometric crystal hydrates. Broad dissemination of these tools and methods and their incorporation into crystal engineering pipelines could indicate fruitful directions in materials design, thus effecting a reduction in time between concept and realization of systems with desired properties and lead to the creation of new learning modules for graduate level courses in topics such as statistical mechanics, science of materials, and machine learning in the molecular sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Guessing how many candies there are in a jar is an ancient mathematical problem that occupied the minds of the greatest mathematicians, from Gauss, Kepler and Hilbert, over centuries. Mathematically, this problem is known as the ""optimal packing problem"" and asks to optimize the filling density of objects of a particular shape occupying a given volume. For example: What is the maximum number of candies of a given shape that can be packed in a jar? Nowadays, interest in the general problem emanates from its practical importance to industries involved in granular media processing and appear in a broad range of science and engineering fields such as self-assembly of nano-particles, liquid crystals, glassy and bio-materials. In fact, understanding the structural and mechanical behavior of packings from the properties of its individual constituents is a central problem in modern materials science.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will develop theoretical models supplemented with computational tests to design packing generation protocols and algorithms which can explore the larger space of parameters in search for the optimal packing.<br/><br/>The algorithms and theories developed by the PI would lead to a deeper understanding of the packing optimization problem and benefit many industrial sectors, especially pharmaceutical and chemical industries which rely on storage and transport of large amounts of granular material, as well as in the oil industry.

The overall aim of this project is to develop a unifying theoretical and numerical framework to predict the structural and mechanical properties of random packings of particles of arbitrary shapes. The goal of the project is two-fold: first, to investigate and discover organizing principles of granular states of matter, and second, to design new granular materials with optimized predefined properties.  To do this, the PI will first develop a theoretical framework to predict the packing fraction of assemblies of non-spherical particles such as composite molecules of rigidly bonded spheres, polymer-like chains, tetrahedra and irregular polyhedra in general, and then test the space of parameters with computational tools based on network theory and machine learning. These results will allow the PI to search for optimal packings of predetermined characteristics, for example denser packings with maximal rigidity by variation of the shape of the anisotropic building blocks.<br/><br/>The potentially transformative aspect of this Eager project is to go beyond the state-of-the-art theory on granular matter by applying novel trends in artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms and network theory.

This award supports research and education that uses data-centric methods to enable the prediction of metal oxide compounds with desired properties.

This allows chemists to tune the structures, properties, and symmetries of these compounds to optimize their performance in specific applications that include catalysis, molecular sieving, gas adsorption, and nonlinear optics.

Hydrothermal synthesis is widely used to create new metal oxide materials with a wide range of functional properties and applications.  This project will advance the field by developing software infrastructure for associating the results of X-ray diffraction experiments with individual reactions, extracting structural outcome descriptors from this data, and then determining the extent to which these structural outcomes can be predicted from reaction description data.  This will be achieved by developing structural outcome descriptors for geometric properties, non-covalent interaction properties, and electron-density properties, then building machine learning models that correlate these outcomes to reaction conditions, and finally testing the quality of these predictions experimentally.  Active learning and auditable and interpretable models will be incorporated into the workflows to help synthetic chemists select better (more insightful/novel) reactions in an interactive fashion."

REU students are learning to use advanced data analytics, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to efficiently identify trends in materials properties that can be used to predict the characteristics of undiscovered materials. This relatively new materials informatics approach promises to enhance efficiency and productivity, but also requires specialized training. This Site provides a comprehensive summer training experience that includes: introductory cross-training in data and materials science fundamentals, hands-on research training, formal educational seminars, and workshops. The Site focuses on providing these opportunities to students that typically do not have exposure to extensive scientific resources. All participants are prepared for careers in materials science in industry, academia, and national laboratories through customized professional development and networking opportunities in addition to extensive support and guidance. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The increasing reliance on big data to guide innovation necessitates a change in the way that materials science students are trained. It has become essential for students to have experience in data-driven approaches and familiarity with the techniques that are now common to the field, yet these opportunities are very limited for undergraduates. This Site represents an entry point into this new approach to training, and prepares students for the emerging field of materials informatics. Training will include an introduction to essential topics such as material science applications, an introduction to data driven approaches, an introduction to machine learning with Python, and laboratory skill and safety training. All research topics are inherently interdisciplinary since the students are paired with primary and secondary mentors that specialize in different approaches to materials science. Scientific topics explored by the students can be divided into four categories, each with an inherent materials informatics component: (1) materials discovery and design; (2) high-throughput exploration; (3) quantitative structure?property relations; and (4) exploring and linking length scales. Taken together, these topics address a societal need for significant acceleration of new materials design and discovery, emergent properties and processing strategies. Reducing the cost and time it takes to discover and develop new materials and technologies can positively impact our economy, our environment, and our future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The neural network architecture that is present in many of these methods has some universal approximation properties that allow users to apply software tools with minimal preprocessing of data or tailoring of algorithms to the specifications of the problem.  However, in most instances where ML works well, mathematical analysis does not yet offer a satisfactory answer to the fundamental question: Why is a machine learning method so effective for solving this problem?  The aim of this project is to investigate how ML methods can be applied to solving non-Markov dynamic programs (DPs), and to answer this fundamental question for some specific problems in this area.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/><br/>The investigator analyzes a new method for solving non-Markov DPs, wherein a policy-approximation function is obtained by training a system of neural networks.  The main idea is similar to recently-developed methods for solving high-dimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), wherein the so-called Deep BSDE Solver learns a function of a high-dimensional input to approximate the optimal control for a Markovian DP.  The aims of this project differ from those of other work because the focus is non-Markov DPs and the hurdles that come from path dependence.  Issues that are explored in depth include the level of accuracy needed in the training set generated by a Monte Carlo particle method, and the role that implicit regularization plays in the TensorFlow algorithms.  The project also considers more conventional theoretical concepts that may provide proof of this method's general effectiveness, such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation for continuous functions and the types of sigmoidal functions used in neural networks.  The results contribute to an improved theoretical understanding of the mathematics behind Deep BSDE when applied to DPs with nonlinear filtering, and help answer important questions regarding the method?s effectiveness.

The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is currently in the midst of Run 2, at almost twice the energy explored earlier and with significantly increased event samples. It is possible that evidence for BSM physics could emerge at this higher energy and with the higher event statistics from the current run and by means of further upgrades of the LHC and ATLAS to follow.<br/><br/>Analytically, the NYU group will be studying Higgs decays, searching for evidence of supersymmetry and exotic new states of matter through several approaches, including the reaction process known as Vector Boson Fusion, and will be developing novel approaches to the reconstruction and study of high energy Jets.  NYU will partner with the Weizmann Institute of Science through support from the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation program to search for the decays of Higgs boson decays to charm quark pairs, through heavy flavor tagging.   Here the joint NYU-Weizmann effort will exploit advanced machine learning techniques to identify and select such challenging final states in Higgs decay. <br/><br/>Technical projects include improvements and refinements of the ATLAS trigger for missing energy, a key variable in the searches for new physics, and track triggering, an essential technique for dealing with reconstruction of events in very high rate collisions, which are endemic at the LHC.  The group also helps to lead a smaller experimental effort called milliQan, whose objective is to search for fractionally charged particles that might be produced at the LHC.<br/><br/>The NYU group's broader impacts efforts are extensive.  For general audiences, the NYU exhibit on the LHC is estimated to reach large numbers of school-age children, and the ""Higgs Hunters"" project has engaged users from a variety of age groups in significant numbers.  For secondary school educators, workshops are also planned at NYU to familiarize and educate teachers with some of the state of the art tools used in the particle physics domain, to provide them with background to bring new knowledge to the classroom.  Additionally, the analytical projects of the group, which include statistical applications, machine learning, and analysis preservation tools and techniques, can be extended to fields outside of physics, and young researchers supported under this program will have training in such innovative and cross-cutting techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).   Detailed measurements of the interactions of these unusual particles are one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>Neutrinos can be produced from ground-based facilities, such as the accelerator complex at Fermilab, and can also come from astrophysical origin.   The interactions of these neutrinos will be recorded and studied in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility located in South Dakota.   DUNE, with its large liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers, will study the oscillations of the accelerator-based neutrino beam from Fermilab, and additionally is sensitive to extra-terrestrial neutrinos, including those from supernova explosions, solar neutrinos, and other sources.   The challenge for the experimenters is the vastly different energies of the neutrinos produced by Fermilab and those from many interesting astrophysical sources. <br/><br/>Through this award, which includes support from the NSF Windows on the Universe Program, the Columbia group will initiate the development of trigger and data acquisition strategies that can provide a guide for DUNE detection of low energy electron neutrino interactions in Liquid Argon.  This includes the use of machine learning techniques for triggering, an approach which has recently been demonstrated to be a disruptive technology for event selection and reconstruction in liquid Argon.   <br/><br/>The broader impact of this triggering approach is significant.  It has the potential to allow the DUNE experiment to make direct and significant contributions to the international scientific effort in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and time-domain astrophysics, through access to solar and supernova neutrinos and as well as to searches for proton decay.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the discovery of the Higgs mechanism in 2012 was a crowning achievement for the Standard Model, many mysteries remain, including the role of the elusive neutrino. Neutrinos are elementary particles that rarely interact with ordinary matter.  The Standard Model predicts three types of massless neutrinos.  However, experimentally, we know that neutrinos do have very small masses, and yet they permeate the universe.  Because they have mass, they can change from one type to another.  Measuring properties of these changes, and comparing them to theoretical predictions, provides a promising pathway to discover how neutrinos shape our universe. To that end, the neutrino community is embarking on a challenging quest to complete the picture of neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will be a massive, 40,000-ton instrument optimized to detect neutrino interactions about a mile underground at Sanford Lab in South Dakota.  This facility, being built during the next 10 years, will observe interactions of neutrinos produced at Fermilab and traveling 800 miles to DUNE and, due to its large volume, can also detect particles coming from astrophysical sources.  This work seeks to develop ways to look for and identify signals for new physics.<br/><br/>The DUNE experiment offers a unique opportunity for a rich astro-particle and exotic physics search program, including: observations of low-energy astrophysical neutrinos, e.g. from supernova core-collapse, thus lending itself to multi-messenger astrophysics, and searches for other rare processes, e.g. proton decay and neutron-antineutron oscillation. If observed, these signatures would have profound implications for particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The rarity of these signals requires continuous, high-resolution readout and processing of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) data from the entire DUNE detector. The resulting data rates for such a data acquisition (DAQ) scheme are prohibitively large and create a challenge: to develop readout and DAQ systems that are capable of significant data reduction and efficient self-triggering with zero deadtime. This award will carry out a unique and ambitious R&D program to develop novel readout and triggering techniques involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployed on FPGA devices, including a demonstration of some of these techniques at the upcoming SBND experiment, beginning in 2019.<br/><br/>This CAREER award will strengthen the undergraduate research experience of Columbia University students, including underrepresented groups. The project will also provide unique opportunities of involvement in cutting edge research in readout electronics, detector R&D, and computer science applications for data handling and data analysis, and further promote interdisciplinary research opportunities for physics and non-physics majors through a Seminar Series developed and organized by the PI.  The award will sponsor an additional slot in Nevis Lab's Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program for two years, specifically for non-physics majors interested in particle physics. Outreach to the public and local high-school students will also be carried out through lectures at local high schools and the Nevis Science-on-Hudson public lecture series.

Learning to build smart, digital, and mechanically functional objects at the microscale could be as revolutionary as human-scale manufacturing. This grant will support research to develop a new way of meeting this challenging goal. It combines two technologies: modern magnetic information storage, which can create tiny magnets in any pattern desired, and ultrathin flexible materials that can bend in response to tiny forces. These will be combined with the design principles of colloidal systems, polymer physics, and molecular biology to create intelligent, functional objects, machines, and materials. The pieces will interact in a way analogous to the way DNA bases bind together, with magnets playing the role of the base pairs, and the thin materials playing the role of the DNA backbone. The magnetic information will determine how multiple strands connect and form complex structures and micron sized machines that can be controlled with external magnetic fields. These materials will ultimately have fundamental impacts on micro-engineering, with a range of potential applications, from materials to medicine. As such, this research will promote the progress of science and ultimately benefit the US economy and society. This research borrows concepts from a variety of fields - a multi-disciplinary approach that will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering and science education. For example, macroscopic analogs will be adopted into lending kits that will be used to explain the basic principles behind base paring in DNA and its assembly into DNA origami structures to impoverished communities in upper Appalachia.<br/> <br/> <br/>Technical Description: This grant will support research aimed at building a new platform for self-assembly that uses panels with magnetic handshakes - microscopic patterns of magnetic dipoles - that enable panels to bond together using specific, intelligent interactions analogous to Watson-Crick base pairs in DNA. By fabricating these panels on nm thin elastic strands grown via atomic layer deposition, the panel sequence will determine how multiple strands connect to one another and form complex untethered structures and micron sized machines that can be manipulated with external magnetic fields. These handshake panels will be programmed using either magneto-optic recording (micron scale) or commercial scanned magnetic write head (50 nm scale). The resulting magnetic colloids, strands, or nets will be released from the substrate into solution, and allowed to bend, move, and assemble according to their designed interactions. The approach of the grant is to integrate design, macroscale models, advanced simulations, and experiment, to master the programmed self-assembly of these magnetic handshake materials. Overall, this strategy both takes advantage of the complementary binding principle behind current state of the art 3D DNA based assembly and overcomes many of its limitations, including vastly expanding the range of operating parameters such as temperature, solvent, etc. The resulting structures can be fully integrated with other lithographic elements (electronics, optics, etc.) and will have broad applications in sensing, actuation, and microrobotics at the cellular scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gaussian processes are used in many application areas, such as geospatial analysis, machine learning, and the analysis of computer experiments. Gaussian processes are flexible, interpretable, and provide natural quantification of uncertainty. However, direct application of Gaussian processes is too computationally expensive for large datasets. This project addresses the computational challenges with novel algorithms and bridges the gap between statistical and machine learning approaches. As big data now appear in almost every field of science and society, providing powerful, scalable, and free software to analyze such datasets can have a transformative effect. This work will replace current practices and approximations for massive spatial data that are often simplistic due to computational limitations. This project can lead to improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification in countless applications with direct impact on society, including carbon monitoring, renewable energy, rainfall prediction, calibration of robotic arms, and modeling and prediction of insurgent activities. The developed methods and software will thus be an important tool for computational and data-enabled science and engineering. The investigators will mentor and train student researchers, and share the project findings via journal publications and conference presentations.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a nearly universal toolbox for scalable Gaussian process (GP) modeling. The toolbox is based on the ordered conditional approximation (OCA), a simple but very powerful idea that exploits the screening effect (i.e., conditional independence) exhibited by many popular covariance functions. The OCA framework unifies many state-of-the-art GP approximations from statistics, machine learning, and numerical linear algebra. This project will result in new, highly accurate OCA methods with guaranteed scalability and broad applicability for modeling and analysis of nonstationary, multivariate, multi-scale, and other processes. Also, extensions will be developed that allow these new spatial-statistics methods to be used in a variety of machine-learning applications, where OCA-type approaches have not received much attention so far. For the new methods, the computational cost is guaranteed to be linear in the data size, with further speed-ups possible through parallelization. All approaches will be implemented in easy-to-use open-source software. This will allow users to bring the power of GPs to bear on modern datasets, enabling spatial prediction, calibration, parameter learning, and nonparametric regression with big data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discovery and design of new materials requires the ability to predict how different chemical elements can combine to make different compounds depending on the temperature. One example of great technological relevance are metallic alloys that form by combining multiple metallic elements at elevated temperatures. Over the past century, materials scientists have measured such compound-formation processes for many materials systems, but the available data still represents only a tiny fraction of the entire space of all possible combinations of chemical elements and temperatures. Meanwhile, machine-learning and data science have made great strides in discovering new patterns and connections, and being able to ?fill in? missing information from large data sets. The research team will extend and develop state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to apply to mathematical models and data for metallic alloys to learn new connections between chemical elements and discover new alloys. If successful, the research team will enable the development of new and improved lightweight structural alloys and longer-lived, higher power density batteries. All of the developed software tools will have publicly available implementations throughout the funding period to accelerate such developments. The research team?s approach uses close collaboration between domain and data scientists with strong ?cross-training? to develop the next generation of scientists and engineers, and data scientists enabling convergent approaches to the challenging problems of science and engineering.<br/> <br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award brings together materials science and engineering, and data science to develop data-intensive methods to determine materials phase diagrams. Design and discovery of new materials relies extensively on phase diagrams that quantify what phase(s) are stable at a given temperature and chemical composition, which is determined by the free energy of different phases. Moreover, many equilibrium material properties are derived from free energies or free-energy differences. Extensive resources have been devoted to experimental determination of phase diagrams for many material systems, but despite these efforts only a tiny fraction of the entire space of possible materials has been explored. High-throughput computational approaches have added to our knowledge, but it is time-consuming to extrapolate from the easy-to-compute zero temperature results to experimentally relevant finite temperature results. While some qualitative chemical and structural trends have been identified?the periodic table being the most well-known example?leveraging this for quantitative predictions is difficult. Simultaneously, significant developments in machine learning have expanded the range of non-linear functions that can be interpolated with uncertainty quantification, advanced the field of dimensionality reduction, and revealed new underlying patterns in data. Continual expansion of computational and experimental open data sets of materials thermodynamics presents a tipping point where constructing machine-learned models for thermodynamic extrapolation becomes feasible, and offers a significant advance beyond high-throughput methods alone.<br/><br/>The research team will develop a novel thermodynamic machine learning engine and demonstrate it for the modeling of materials at relevant conditions with a focus on: (1) lightweight metallic alloys to predict of phase diagrams at new compositions, and (2) extending to native oxide thermodynamics. The PIs will employ a combination of semi-supervised learning, a generative adversarial network framework for discriminative and generative learning, and functional quantile learning including uncertainty quantification. If successful, the thermodynamic machine learning engine can be expanded to other material spaces including high-temperature alloys, and battery and fuel cell materials. It can drive future high-throughput computation and experiment. The team will interact with TRIPODS centers for dissemination, discussions, and collaborations as it develops deeper connections with data science driven by the challenges of domain science and engineering.<br/><br/>Developing an accurate, predictive, and computationally efficient free energy function for the full range of materials space is a transformative innovation for the design and discovery of materials. The underlying dimensionality reduction inherent in the universal free energy function permits the discovery of new relationships between chemical elements and solid phases, beyond existing qualitative relationships. Uncertainty quantification can identify unexplored but valuable regions of chemical and structure space to provide a new paradigm for high-throughput computation and experimental methods to optimally expand our knowledge of materials and chemical relationships. The data science innovations will extend the scope of Gaussian process-based modeling, enable machine learning with functional data and couple it with recent advances in data-depth, advance generative adversarial networks and related Bayesian studies for functional data generative models with uncertainty quantification, and extend quantile regression to function-valued responses.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division, and the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their apparent complexity, many such systems exhibit a form of underlying organized structure (``building blocks''), whose discovery would enhance our ability to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena. The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of mathematical and algorithmic tools that can harness the information content of large datasets acquired from experiments and observations to create coherent representations of complex systems, and use these representations to perform prediction, and ultimately, control. These objectives will be addressed through a novel combination of mathematical techniques, bridging dynamical systems theory and differential geometry with machine learning and data science. The newly developed techniques will be tested and applied in real-world problems through collaboration with domain experts in the areas of climate dynamics, space physics, and condensed matter physics. The project will also contribute to STEM workforce and curricular development through training of students and postdoctoral researchers, and design of multi-disciplinary lecture courses.      <br/><br/>The modern scientific method is undergoing an evolutionary change wherein large data sets and machine learning algorithms have the potential to outperform classical first-principles approaches for certain complex phenomena.  For these tools to be accepted by the scientific community, a rigorous mathematical framework is required to match the verifiability and quantifiability of the classical modeling approach.  Recently, a new tool called the diffusion forecast has been developed based on provably consistent estimators, which learn the unknown structure of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems on manifolds.  Moreover, the results of many published numerical experiments indicate that this framework can be applied far beyond the restricted context of the current theory.  In particular, the evidence suggests that the consistency proofs can be extended to non-autonomous projections of complex systems, deterministic chaotic systems represented by non-compact operators, non-smooth domains such as fractal attractors, and even generalized tensors on metric-measure spaces. This project will undertake a rigorous mathematical unification of these problems, leading to transformative advances in our ability to model and describe complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Truly autonomous systems will have to be able to act and make decisions under uncertainty. The key component that decides what action an autonomous system takes is the controller of the system, which guarantees that the system always remains in stable and safe states. Thus, designing controllers to stabilize systems is an important problem in a wide range of applications that include virtual or physical systems acting in an environment. The computational methodologies that will be developed in this project aim towards a reliable stabilization of large-scale systems from data alone, even when only little data and data polluted with noise are available. These algorithms have the potential to have significant impact on critical issues such as efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous systems. The project will promote cross-disciplinary collaborations from machine learning to control theory to numerical analysis to scientific computing and will support education and diversity by creating novel courses and outreach activities that integrate underrepresented groups in the above disciplines.<br/><br/>Robust stabilization typically requires solving nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problems that are computationally and mathematically challenging. Furthermore, in many situations, models of the systems of interest are unavailable. Rather, data are sampled from the systems and stabilization has to be achieved via learning from these data. This project develops and integrates new methods for nonsmooth optimization via gradient sampling and data-driven (nonintrusive) model reduction via the Loewner framework. The first contribution will be a multifidelity version of the gradient sampling algorithm for nonsmooth optimization that exploits low-cost, low-fidelity gradient approximations of a computationally expensive objective to accelerate the estimation of gradients. If successful, this multifidelity approximation has the potential to make tractable gradient sampling for large-scale optimization problems and at the same time maintain the rigorous convergence guarantees that gradient sampling is known for. The second contribution is to exploit the stability radius of robust controllers to reduce the number of data points (samples) that are required to learn reduced models for stabilizing systems. To that end, a new approach for learning reduced models from data is proposed that allows the learned models to divert from the real system dynamics by as much as can be compensated for by the robustness (stability radius) in favor of reducing the number of data points. If the project is successful, the developed methodologies will enable efficiently and rigorously stabilizing systems that are large-scale and from which few data points and/or high-noise data are available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contemporary practice of  computational optimization is, however, too often divorced from its classical mathematical roots. The scholarship and fast computational technology that has matured from decades of research on smooth optimization has had huge applied scientific impact.  It is well known that behind any superlinear acceleration always lurk Newtonian ideas.  By contrast, while an elegant and powerful theory of nonsmooth optimization has also matured, nonsmooth computational practice appears far more challenging.  Without explicit algebraic structure, practitioners resort to black-box algorithms, convenient but slow. Despite much research, effective Newtonian ideas have remained conspicuously absent. The PI bridges this disciplinary chasm, bringing to bear expertise in the requisite mathematics of ""nonsmooth"" phenomena beyond the reach of traditional calculus, while developing algorithms with dramatic potential impact. Cornell doctoral students engage widely in the project, on foundations and computing, publishing and presenting at conferences, and collaborating with the PI through seminars  and teaching.  Cornell's Operations Research program trains doctoral students (typically one third of whom are women) for both academia and industry, striving to support underrepresented minorities. The PI will disseminate this research through graduate texts, broad-audience surveys, diverse collaboration, and international lectures for audiences across science and engineering.<br/><br/>This structure dilemma in nonsmooth optimization is, however, a false dichotomy, and one that Newtonian ideas can transform.  The PI pursues a semi-structured middle ground, fertile for fast algorithms.  Even without explicit presentations, concrete objectives typically boast a rich inherent variational-analytic structure, well approximated by computationally-amenable nonsmooth models.  The project's attack is two-pronged:  ""partly smooth"" structure drives a Newtonian alternating-projection-inspired method for variational inequalities, while the availability of approximating models drives an innovative ""bundle Newton"" algorithm that shows early computational promise.  Fundamental to this project is the development of such methods into robust practical algorithms with sound theoretical foundations.  Immediate target applications include moderately-sized models, from robust control, for example.  However, such second-order ideas could also accelerate larger-scale first-order methods for signal processing, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics.  The PI leverages the exciting interplay between variational analysis and more classical mathematical domains:  semi-algebraic geometry, in particular, serves as an illuminating arena for ""concrete"" objectives, and matrix spectral analysis offers a rich computational testbed for nonsmooth ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We already have devices that turn sunlight into electricity and use sunlight to split water into precious hydrogen fuel, but issues such as device efficiency and cost mean that the current technologies cannot be taken to the vast scale needed for our modern needs. This puzzle may be solved by the use of advanced materials that perform their tasks - energy conversion, cancer cell killer, or whatever it may be - with greater efficiency.  This is inevitably leading us towards more complicated materials that consist of many different chemical elements and have engineered structures on multiple different length-scales from the atomic to the nano- and meso-scales all the way to macroscopic scales.  The problem is that, because of their complexity, it becomes very difficult to even characterize these materials when we have made them, let alone design and engineer them at the nanoscale.  Our usual tools based on the scattering of x-rays by crystals stop working for such nanoscale structures.  The problem is not that we lack powerful enough x-ray beams.  The problem is that the x-ray scattering signal from these complicated materials doesn't contain enough information to allow us to find a unique structure solution.  It is as if we are looking at complex patterns of atomic arrangements through blurry, steamed up glasses.  This project will bring greater clarity to this situation by marrying together advances in applied mathematics from diverse areas such as image recognition, information theory and machine learning, which are having transformative impacts in commerce, law enforcement and so on, and applying them to the problem of recognizing atomic arrangements in materials of the highest complexity.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The approach will to solve multi-scale structures of materials by marrying together the latest advances in the processing of x-ray scattering data from nanomaterials, such as atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, with other sources of input information such as small angle scattering, EXAFS and other spectroscopies, as well as inputs from first principle theory such as DFT, but place them in a rigorous mathematical framework and a robust computational framework such that the information content in the data may be utilized to the greatest extent possible whilst taking into account uncertainties from statistical and systematic uncertainties.

The relevance of optimization has increased manyfold alongside advances in computer design, and recently alongside the availability of vast and complex datasets arising from internet applications.  Optimization has become a central part of machine learning.  However, even the most efficient optimization algorithms are unable to succeed for complicated models populated by huge datasets possessing little special structure, the main problem being the limited core memory available on (even large) computers.  While Moore's Law accurately predicted exponentially-increasing computing power, the surprise has been that the sizes of datasets are increasing much faster.  A central focus of the project is the design of algorithms capable of solving a complicated optimization model populated with a huge dataset, by breaking apart the model into a sequence of computational problems, each relying on only a portion of the data, not too much for core memory.  Graduate students participate in the research.<br/><br/>The general approach makes use of the most elemental of algorithms for convex optimization, namely, subgradient methods, dating to the 1960's.  In tandem, the approach makes use of -- and advances -- a framework promoted by the investigator in recent years, whereby a general convex optimization problem is transformed into an equivalent convex optimization problem whose only constraints are linear equations and for which the objective function is Lipschitz continuous (thereby allowing direct application of subgradient methods).  Exploration is being done initially for linear programming, an ambitious goal being to solve problems even beyond the reach of the simplex method (in cases where the basis-inverse matrix is larger than core memory permits).  Focus also is being given to problems involving an objective function that is itself the sum of many functions, a common setting in machine learning.  Here the goal is to devise algorithms that are able to choose the summand functions in a principled (and efficient) manner, unlike incremental (sub)gradient methods, which choose a summand uniformly at random.  Additionally, attempts are being made to extend the investigator's framework so as to provide, for example, a way to transform a continuously-differentiable objective function, possibly with bounded domain, into an entire function possessing Lipschitz-continuous gradient, thereby allowing accelerated methods to be applied easily.  A particularly important aspect of the project is the design of practical schemes for speeding up first order methods when the optimization problem being solved has some particular kind of geometrical structure (such as ""sharpness,"" where the objective function grows linearly with the distance to optimality).  The goal is to design schemes that require no knowledge of parameters governing the geometrical structure, and yet that are guaranteed to achieve optimal speedup whenever the structure is present (regardless of whether the user knows the structure is present).

To develop design strategies, there is need for a quantitative understanding of the microscopic mechanisms controlling molecular transport, solubility, and hence permeability and selectivity of these materials. The PI will use computer simulations and data-intensive approaches to target some of the most important unresolved questions in this topic.<br/>This award supports research which will primarily use molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning methodologies to address three important questions: (i) Can data-intensive methods be applied to design membrane materials of interest? More specifically, can data mining and machine learning be used to predict permeability and selectivity, and thus the upper bound correlation for membrane gas separation performance? (ii) It has been found that the solute size dependence of permeability in the case of rubbery polymers is ""opposite"" to that found in their glassy analogs. Is this a general trend, and if so, how does the transition from glassy trends, dominated by sieving, to rubbery behavior, which is probably driven by solubility effects, occur? and (iii) What is the role of nanoparticles when they are physically mixed with polymers in the context of gas separation? How is this phenomenon affected if the nanoparticles are made selective? What is the role of nanoparticles in aging of polymer glasses in this context?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Special emphasis is given to methods applicable to multivariate data, an area that has received relatively less attention, though often necessary in performing real data analyses. The methods developed will be tuning-free, computationally feasible, and well-defined under minimal assumptions on the underlying models. On the collaborative front, the PI will continue interdisciplinary research in astronomy and in particular, some of the methodology discussed in this project will address important scientific questions arising from astronomy and will form the dissertation theses of two PhD students at Columbia. The PI will also continue the tradition of mentoring summer interns. The graduate student support will be used on interdisciplinary research and writing codes.<br/><br/><br/>The PI investigates two core directions of research in nonparametric statistics with special emphasis to multivariate data. The main trust of this project is to study multivariate distribution-free nonparametric rank-methods based that generalize the classical univariate rank-based procedures to multivariate data. This new general framework crucially uses ideas from the theory of optimal transport ? an important and very active research area in applied mathematics/probability/machine learning. The second part of the project is on multivariate nonparametric (heteroscedastic) mixture models and is directly motivated by astronomy collaborations involving the PI. Statistical inference of stellar populations of interest is complicated by significant observational limitations ? in particular, by heteroscedastic measurement errors. Indeed, almost all data sets in astronomy contain known (heteroscedastic) error measurements on every observation. This naturally leads to data that can be modeled as nonparametric (heteroscedastic) mixture models. The PI, along with his collaborators, will investigate several aspects of this problem: (a) estimation of the data distributions, (b) denoising the observations, and (c) studying the associated deconvolution and manifold learning problems.

The central aims of this project are to perform a systematic screening of tin alloys and develop a library of neural network-based interatomic potentials for an extended set of chemical elements. The neural network models will be used to accelerate the search over possible structures at the level of atoms. Research into tin alloys has attracted renewed interest due to their potential to display novel physics and next-generation functional features. Finely tuned tin-based topological insulators could find future use in spintronics, quantum computing, and thermoelectric materials which can generate electricity from heat.

The PI will focus on the systematic study of tin-based materials. The work is motivated by the remarkable richness of the tin alloys' structural and electronic properties enabling their use as topological insulators, battery anodes, solders, and more. The main challenges associated with the study and development of tin alloys lie in the complexity of their structures and the diversity of their bonding mechanisms. These factors limit the scope of ab initio-based study and the accuracy of classical potential-based modeling. <br/><br/>The PI aims to demonstrate that the efficiency and reliability of materials prediction can be improved considerably by: (i) screening a large materials class with a suite of diverse search strategies, and (ii) using emerging neural network methodology for modeling interatomic interactions to accelerate the search. For the comprehensive sampling of the configuration space of structures and compositions, the research team will rely on a combination of high-throughput, evolutionary, and rational design searches. Identification of new tin-based wide-gap topological insulators, durable battery anodes, and stable lead-free solders will advance knowledge in several areas of basic and application-driven research. For the systematic construction of reusable neural network models, the research team will use a recently developed stratified training procedure enabling a natural extension of libraries to larger sets of chemical systems. The neural network models will be freely available as a part of the group's open-source MAISE package. This effort will promote the development and application of emerging machine learning methods in materials research.

For the quantity under study, these PDEs reveal the relation between the rates of change in different directions, and dictate the properties and evolution of the quantity. At the heart of the study of PDEs is a particular characteristic of solutions known as regularity. Theoretically, regularity is necessary to justify the models, and is the stepping stone for other properties of the solution (existence, uniqueness, and long term behavior). In practice, applications of the models involve numerical solutions of the PDEs and to obtain reasonable results requires stability of the solutions, which is often a consequence of regularity. Broadly speaking, objects that might seem rough often turn out to be regular if they satisfy an elliptic equation or constraint. The investigator will investigate three specific phenomena under this general philosophy: free interface problems, optimal transport maps, and free boundary problems. The results of this project will have numerous applications in other fields such as computer vision, data mining, machine learning, material sciences and biology.<br/><br/>The first project will investigate interfaces arising in the study of liquid drops exposed to electric fields. The goal is to show that these interfaces are smooth in low spatial dimensions. This is related to an important conjecture in the physics literature. The second project concerns the optimal transport map between convex domains in Euclidean spaces. The plan is to show that without any extra assumptions on the domains, these maps can be very regular ""up to the boundary"". The third project is about free boundary problems, in particular problems involving multiple interacting free boundaries.

The proposed study will connect optimal transport, a classical analysis subject, with many widely used methods in data-driven problems. Results of this research will offer better understandings of existing numerical methods and promote the development of the new techniques for solving inverse problems with high accuracy and fast convergence. The wide range of applications will also increase partnerships and collaboration between academia and industry. Students will be offered many opportunities of joining this research in translating attractive theoretical properties of optimal transport onto various applications in modern science and engineering.<br/><br/>The proposed research analyzes the intrinsic multiscale features in optimal transport-based seismic inversion to build robust algorithms for solving general nonlinear large-scale inverse problems. The focus is on designing objective functions in constrained local optimization. A standard approach of measuring the least-squares mismatch between model predictions and data is to use frequency marching and weighting methods in which different frequencies are treated separately; first the low-frequency errors are eliminated followed by high-frequency errors. This particular ordering based on the multiscale inversion scheme addresses two of the biggest challenges in inversion by mitigating problems with local minima in gradient-based optimization and accelerating convergence. The PI's recent work has introduced a framework for seismic inverse problems using the Wasserstein distance as the objective function. Using the theory of optimal transport, the PI proved that this metric offers a convex optimization landscape and the PI's numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence to global minimizers for cases where the least-squares norm has difficulties. The proposed research will investigate the connections between optimal transport-based inversion with existing frequency marching and weighting methods to extend the optimal transport techniques to nonlinear inverse problems beyond seismology. In particular, the PI will formulate optimal transport-based inversion for quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Methods in this work will be developed using existing frameworks of iterative methods and dynamical systems for convergence analysis. Theoretical results from this research will shed light on the relationship between data fitting (residual reduction) and model fitting (solution error) in various data-driven inverse problems and iterative methods.

Jang of Queens College, City University of New York, is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry for developing and applying quantum dynamics methods for fluctuating systems in quantum environments.  For example, think of a molecular substance, like sugar, dissolved in a glass of water.  One could think of the electrons in the sugar molecule as the quantum system and the vibrations of the atoms in the sugar molecule as the quantum environment.  The fluctuations are caused by the motions of the solvent molecules.  Because of the counter-intuitive nature of quantum mechanics, it can be difficult to predict or understand the behavior of quantum systems without elaborate calculations.  However, even after almost a century since the theory of quantum mechanics was founded, reliable quantum dynamics calculations beyond simple models and systems remain notoriously difficult to solve. Building on their earlier computational research, Professor Jang and coworkers are establishing systematic computational approaches appropriate for very large systems in realistic environments. Accurate descriptions of the dynamic behaviors of such quantum systems has significant implications for designing novel energy conversions, imaging, and information processing devices.  Applications of these methods can elucidate quantum effects that remain important in noisy environments and can help develop new kinds of novel quantum devices. Professor Jang is working on a book on molecular excitons, which are important for solar energy conversion and imaging, and a review article on quantum dynamics methods.  He is also dedicated to organizing conferences on cutting edge topics, and is developing new types of undergraduate level classes integrating experiments and computation.<br/><br/>Professor Jang's group is developing and applying theories and computational methods for the dynamics calculation of quantum systems subject to general time dependent fluctuations while interacting with quantum environments.  Accurate descriptions of the interplay of these two complicating factors has significant implications for long-range energy and charge transfer processes in complex molecular environments, and is one of central issues in quantum thermodynamics, information processing, and conductance. On one hand, this theory is pursued through master equation approaches, by combining the polaron transformation or modular coarse-graining with systematic higher order expansions.  On the other hand, path-integral based theories and simulation methods are generalized for fluctuating systems. These methods are then applied and tested for the dynamics of delocalized excitons in light harvesting complexes and nanotubes, and for proton or proton-coupled electron transfer reactions in dynamic molecular environments.  Outcomes of this research can elucidate spatio-temporal dynamics of delocalized excitons in complex environments and can provide key insights into the interplay between the effects of quantum environments and time dependent fluctuations in the dynamics of protons and loose electrons   Professor Jang is working on a book on the dynamics of molecular excitons and a comprehensive review article on quantum master and Fokker-Planck equations.

The structure of molecules is central to chemistry, recognized since the pioneering efforts of 19th century scientists such as Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff, who formulated the structure of the tetrahedral carbon atom, and Louis Pasteur, who unraveled the relationship between molecular chirality and their corresponding crystal forms. Chirality, a property typically associated with the spatial arrangement of four different groups about a carbon atom, is essential to molecules of life such as proteins and DNA, as well as pharmaceutical compounds beneficial to human health. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, this project uses a combination of computation and experiment to design adaptive host frameworks, built from molecules, that crystallize around awkwardly shaped large guest molecules, some chiral, that otherwise cannot crystallize on their own. This approach unravels the rules for assembly of molecules into multicomponent crystals while also allowing determination of molecular structure using X-ray diffraction, providing a valuable tool to organic synthetic chemists in academic and commercial laboratories, including pharmaceutical companies that need structural information for drug development. Capitalizing on the structure of the NSF program Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI), New York University undergraduate and graduate students benefit from internships supported by the Merck Future Talent Program to gain research experience in an industrial setting at the nearby GOALI partner, Merck & Co., Inc. The project also partners with the NYU Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program to introduce students from underrepresented groups to the structure of molecules, including creation of an educational coloring book with illustrations of molecules that are relevant to human health; provides professional development activities for students and postdocs; builds a broad-based conduit to the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras for undergraduate and graduate research; and hosts chemical crystallography workshops and master classes for the academic, government and industrial sectors. Consequently, the project benefits learners at multiple levels and widens the pipeline for opportunities and careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).<br/><br/>Technical Summary. Molecular frameworks, spanning metal-organic, covalent-organic and hydrogen-bonded, occupy a central role in solid-state chemistry, largely owing to the ability to tune their properties through molecular design. Hydrogen-bonded frameworks (HBFs) are unique owing to their ability to form crystalline stoichiometric inclusion compounds by encapsulating guest molecules in well-defined cavities. Hydrogen-bonded guanidinium-organosulfonate (GS) host frameworks are remarkably versatile in this respect, with an ability to capture a wide range of guest molecules in tunable cavities of frameworks with architectures that adapt to the size and shape of the guests. These characteristics provide a unique opportunity to unravel, and then deploy, the rules governing host-guest organization and solid-state structure in general. Operating under a GOALI construct, with support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, New York University and Merck & Co. investigators deploy a substantial collection of GS frameworks with an aim of devising optimization protocols ? from simple geometric fitting to machine learning tools ? for targeted inclusion of guest molecules through single-step crystallization of high quality single crystals. This protocol enables determination of the molecular structure of encapsulated guests, including absolute configuration of stereogenic centers, addressing a critical challenge faced by synthetic chemists in the academic and industrial sectors. Consequently, the research plan provides a springboard for an entirely new application for HBFs while revealing factors responsible for assembly and structure of inclusion compounds in general. The GOALI capitalizes on the knowledge base of Merck to determine the scope and generality of this approach with a focus on target molecules of real-world interest, whether reaction intermediates, chemical impurities, active pharmaceutical ingredients or their analogs. The methodology is disseminated to the public through publications, direct E-mail, and a stand-alone website that will announce new structure assignments, archive the results and integrate computational tools for framework selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A wide-spread technique derives this number, the redshift, from carefully measuring galaxy colors, using an analysis called ""photo-zs"".  Unfortunately, current estimation methods are not precise enough to achieve major survey science goals.  The present team of astronomers and statisticians will improve both the precision and the reliability of photo-zs.  This work will provide key enabling technology for large surveys in progress and in development, which represent a considerable investment in astronomy.  This project will increase the return on that investment.  The research requires innovation in both astronomy and statistics and the development of new statistical methods likely to have significant additional impact.  The research will help to train a diverse population of students and postdocs in advanced statistics via summer schools and other special sessions, and historically, many such trainees have gone on to pursue careers in data science.<br/><br/>Current and forthcoming automated digital sky surveys aim to push further into ""precision cosmology"" territory by meticulously mapping the distribution and properties of hundreds of millions of galaxies, and measuring the details of thousands of supernovae.  This requires accurate and precise estimation of the redshifts of galaxies using broad-band photometric data, by the technique known as photometric redshifts, or photo-zs for short.  Unfortunately, current estimation methods do not enable the most complete science return from these surveys.  The present project unites astronomers and statisticians to improve the precision as well as the reliability of photo-zs, by modeling spectral energy distributions of galaxies, using Bayesian functional data analysis (FDA), an approach that emphasizes predictive modeling and thorough propagation of information and uncertainty across hierarchical, multi-stage discovery chains.  The project will use a modular, hierarchical modeling framework and account for similarity and diversity, with both conventional parameterizations, and new data-driven parameterizations.  Because this framework will produce probabilistic photo-z estimates, with possibly complex uncertainties, the team will also study how optimally to provide such estimates and to use them for cosmological science.  Open-source implementations of their algorithms will be accelerated by graphics processing units where appropriate.  The research will provide valuable inter-disciplinary training to a graduate student, while developing new statistical methods by innovatively combining FDA, machine learning, and high-performance computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Theory and computer simulations will be used in this research to predict how solid-like materials move and fail. It focuses on materials that are disordered ? where the constituent parts are all jumbled up ? because there is not yet a good understanding of how such materials fail.  Examples of such societally important material failure events are everywhere ? ranging from rupture of a plastic container or grain silo to avalanches and mudslides.  By understanding how these materials behave while they are failing, we will be able to better predict failure events and rationally design materials that resist failure or fail in precise, pre-programmed ways. <br/><br/>In addition, a new class of active matter materials, where the constituent parts can move by themselves, are being developed in labs all over the world. However, there are no well-established theories for how those materials flow and fail when the constituent parts are tightly packed together. This project seeks to identify similarities between new active matter solids and non-active solids that are in the process of failing, to better predict the behavior of active solids. An additional goal is to design, or engineer disordered active solids to move in a programmed way to execute tasks. <br/><br/>Crowds composed of animals or humans can be thought of as a type of active ?solid?.  Dense human crowds exhibit many of the features of solid-like materials, including the ability to support waves composed of small changes to crowd density, which are known as sound waves in ordinary materials, as well as dangerous failure events which can lead to crushing. However, since human crowds are actively moving at all times, existing theories for static solids cannot be applied to them.  This research will develop a new set of theoretical and computational tools to model failure in active matter crowds. A long-term goal of this work is to understand which types of crowd structures are more likely to lead to local crushing events, and to develop tools to predict and prevent such events.<br/><br/>Finally, this project will contribute to the education and professional development of a broad pipeline of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers. It will support ongoing efforts to broaden the participation of under-represented groups, including women, in STEM fields through professional development programming, and support the PI to develop a new ?active matter? module for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary Physical Cell Biology class. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education. The PI aims to develop a broad theoretical and computational framework for predicting the dynamics of unstable and active solids, by exploiting and extending previously developed methods that use vibrational modes to predict deformation in stable disordered materials. The first objective is to use a new computational method to quantify the localized deformations and normal modes of unstable disordered solids during an avalanche or catastrophic failure event. These data will be used to develop an analytic continuum model that predicts brittle and ductile failure and incorporates features of both elasto-plastic and shear transformation zone models.  The second objective is to elucidate a nascent connection between sheared particulate matter and active self-propelled particles, using a new computational technique. The third objective is to create a stable active matter simulation, based on ?point-of-interest? human crowds, and match it to a non-active simulation with an artificial external potential, as a tractable starting point for extending vibrational mode analysis directly to active systems.  This will enable simulations that gradually tune away from the stable active solid in order to generate a theoretical framework that can make accurate predictions about density fluctuations in human crowds and other active matter systems.<br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge by identifying new types of material behaviors that are possible for driven or active systems at very high densities. Unlike active gases or fluids, these high density unstable and active solids can transmit shear stresses, exhibit strongly anisotropic behavior, and likely store memories.  Preliminary data suggests these new methods can be used to predict dynamics and behavior in active or unstable avalanching systems, which would represent a systematic approach to rationally design active solids to exhibit specified rheological behaviors or accomplish tasks. A second thrust will focus on a new idea for quantitatively comparing sheared particulate systems and active matter, in order to understand which ideas from well-studied sheared systems can be adapted to make prediction for active matter, and also where there are important differences between sheared and active systems that require new theories.  Together, this will permit the development of an analytic continuum model for predicting avalanches and instabilities in both sheared and active matter systems.<br/><br/>This work is applicable to problems of societal import. Avalanches and catastrophic brittle failure in granular materials and structural glasses are important in industry and nature ? the tools developed here to constrain continuum models based on microscopic material properties could improve scientists? ability to predict earthquake and landslide dynamics, as well as help rationally design better structural materials.  This funding would also contribute to a societal goal of broadening participation in STEM, through training and mentoring of female scientists, including a systematic series of women-specific professional development events. As part of this proposal, the PI will also develop an active matter module, with lecture materials, active learning exercises, and a group research project that will be deployed in a course for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial membrane vesicles, called liposomes, are composed of membrane lipids and proteins which form an envelope similar to a cell membrane. Natural membranes have two layers of lipids and are asymmetric in terms of composition with different types of lipids in each of the two lipid layers that form the membrane.  But a key limitation in the utility of artificial liposomes has been their lack of lipid asymmetry. Earlier studies by the PI and group discovered a novel method on how to prepare asymmetric liposomes. The focus of this project will be in developing a basic understanding of materials sciences in the preparation of the asymmetric liposomes with a variety of unnatural lipids, and then compare their functional properties. With the knowledge gained from the proposed materials research, this project also will define of how to adapt the methods developed to change the lipids in biological cells, which should enable applications in which biomaterials derived from natural cell membranes are used to delivery molecules and other applications. With respect to broader impacts, this project will have a strong impact on career development of future scientists, including students from underrepresented groups, by training graduate and undergraduate students (including via contacts with other local institutions) in the conduct of research, experimental principles, and the specialized experimental techniques used in membrane research. Students will also be trained in proper conduct of scientific studies and scientific writing and speaking. This will in turn prepare them for their professional growth and careers in research, teaching and allied fields.<br/><br/>Technical Section: <br/>Lipid asymmetry, a difference in the lipid composition in the inner and outer leaflets (monolayers) of a biological membrane, is a crucial property of many cell membranes. Artificial vesicles (liposomes) containing lipid bilayers are biomaterials that have proven invaluable models of biological membranes, and possible use in a number of applications, but a lack of methods to prepare liposomes with asymmetric lipid distributions has limited their utility. This project involves developing novel methods in developing asymmetric vesicles using modified cyclodextrins. The first goal will to prepare asymmetric liposomes containing unnatural and positively charged cationic lipids or polyethylene glycol derivized-lipids in only their inner or outer monolayers. Liposomes containing these lipids have applications in delivery of biomolecules and drugs into cells that in turn could modify cell properties or gene expression. By restricting these unnatural lipids to only one of the two lipid layers, these studies will maximize the amount of molecules that can be delivered into cells by trapping them within liposomes, and tailoring these liposomes to maximize interactions and compatibility with biological systems. The second goal involves extending these studies to biological cells. Conditions allowing replacement of the lipids in the outer layer of cell plasma membranes, and how this alters membrane physical structure and membrane integrity, will be defined. This will enable the preparation of novel biomaterials having natural membranes as their starting point. In these studies, students will receive specialized training in a variety of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques used to study membrane proteins and lipids, including newly developed methods. Students will also be trained in proper conduct of scientific studies, and writing skills and speaking skills. This will prepare them for careers in field of biological/biophysical research and/or teaching. This project should broadly impact the field of membrane biology, including drug delivery and nanomaterial applications."

These active stresses make biological systems examples of active matter, and are ultimately are responsible for many of their unusual behaviors. Creating artificial active matter opens up a new route towards constructing materials with lifelike functionalities.

Second, a novel system will be created in which active stress generation will be modulated by directly affixing kinesin-14 to microtubules in predetermined patterns. Theory and simulations will be used to guide which patterns to create, and conversely, measuring the resulting active stress generation in these designed materials will provide a stringent test of theory and simulations. Third, a multi-scale modeling framework will be developed and tested. These will be subsequently related to each other through a combination of analytical calculations and simulations. The resulting models will be made with continual feedback from experiments. Taken together, this work will establish new paradigms to study, understand, and engineer active stresses in active materials.<br/><br/>This DMR grant supports research to understand the assemblages of microtubules and kinesin-14 molecular motors with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and Biomaterials (BMAT) Programs in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peptides are naturally occurring biological molecules that are found in all living organisms.  In cells, they perform many biological functions, for example acting as hormones.  Beta-sheets are a common structure found in peptide assemblies associated with many human diseases, most notable of which is Alzheimer's disease.

Waveguide-QED (quantum electrodynamics) provides a recent framework in which such interactions, i.e. those between guided photons (particles of light) and elementary quantum emitters (real or artificial atoms), are controlled and engineered through the structure and geometry of the environment in which the two interact.  Work under the preceding NSF award has demonstrated the implementation of a novel experimental platform for studies of waveguide-QED effects in the context of ultracold atoms. Here, the wells of an optical lattice (i.e. a crystal made of light) act as quantum emitters, while guided atomic matter waves play the role of light.  As a matter-wave analogue of optical waveguide-QED, this platform offers exquisite tunability and control of the relevant parameters along with access to novel geometries, which are difficult to realize otherwise. The project will investigate the interplay of emitter energies, interactions and geometry to study fundamental questions in waveguide-QED, such as how quantum emitters interact with an engineered environment, how they interact with each other, and what novel phenomena can result from the interaction. The project will thereby offer a glimpse at the quantum simulation of exotic material systems, which can guide future technological efforts. <br/><br/>The project, which builds on prior NSF-supported work, is devoted to studies of matter-wave analogues of spontaneous-emission phenomena in photonic-crystal waveguides, using arrays of matter-wave quantum emitters in a state-selective optical lattice. The free tunability of both the excitation energy of the emitters and their vacuum coupling in this recently demonstrated platform enables the exploration of a wide range of novel effects across regimes both accessible and inaccessible to standard quantum optical systems. The project aims to investigate Markovian and non-Markovian emission dynamics into one- and higher-dimensional environments that feature multiple spectral gaps and singularities. Furthermore, the project seeks to characterize coherent couplings between emitters mediated by a dynamical bound state via quasiparticle transport and the formation of interacting many-body phases, and to exploit some of the unique features arising from collisional interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum mechanics is reversible, that is, a hypothetical movie of a quantum system looks the same if it is played forward or in reverse.  So how can damping, something non-reversible, emerge in quantum physics?  This project aims to engineer a simple model system consisting of an ""atomic quantum dot"" (an artificial atom) coupled to an empty vacuum, the simplest of all environments. This tunable experimental system, which emits matter waves rather than optical radiation, will allow for precise investigation of damping as the structure of the environment is changed. It should be possible to build laser-like sources using a large number of regularly spaced atomic quantum dots, and to exploit the coupling to the environment for a novel form of quantum tunneling, which may find use in quantum simulation of solid-state phenomena. While this first set of experiments sheds light on the nature of quantum mechanical damping, a second set of experiments will investigate whether such damping due to a large environment can be avoided. Here, the model system considered will consist of an atom moving through a one-dimensional atomic gas in a tube-like geometry. Collisions should slow down the atom and damp its motion completely, but it may be possible to harness quantum mechanics to shield the atomic motion by rendering the environment effectively transparent, such that damping is suppressed. Developing ways to control damping and dissipation are of paramount importance for quantum simulation and quantum information science, and the results of this project will be of relevance in addressing some of the fundamental challenges.<br/><br/>The project is devoted to the experimental study of novel dissipative systems in the context of ultracold atomic physics, focusing on engineered atomic quantum dots and mobile impurities coupled to a bosonic environment with controllable many-body character. The implementation of such systems is made possible through the use of ultracold, homonuclear atomic mixtures with hyperfine-state components that are independently controlled with state-dependent optical potentials. The project goals include an exploration of spontaneous and superradiant matter-wave emission, of couplings induced by evanescent matter-wave fields arising from coherent dressing, as well as couplings provided by phononic excitations of a superfluid environment, with the prospect of realizing a dissipative quantum Ising chain. Exploiting the coupling to one-dimensional Bose gases, the project furthermore aims to investigate dissipative and coherent transport for unconfined impurities near integrability, with the prospect of observing novel many-body effects."

For the capture and storage of solar energy, water splitting is the ideal reaction.  The recombination of H2 and O2 to produce water is a convenient and clean source of energy upon demand.  This research project involves making new molecules to facilitate the water splitting reaction in the Eisenberg lab, making new dye molecules to absorb visible light from the sun in the Detty lab, studying the fast photochemical reactions that occur after those molecules absorb light in the McCamant lab, and making new nanoparticle semiconductor systems as scaffolds for solar hydrogen production in the Watson lab.  Each of the investigators brings to the collaborative research different perspectives and skills that are leading to a significant new understanding of a fundamentally challenging problem in solar energy conversion.  In outreach efforts, the scientists supported by this grant are working with local elementary schools in Rochester and Buffalo, New York, to develop energy-related science modules that can inspire the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>This research, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF, consists of the design and study of systems for the light-driven generation of H2 from aqueous protons, and associated photochemical and photophysical investigations to fully understand this transformation. The reaction corresponds to the reductive side of water splitting, 2H+ + 2e- -> H2, which is the key reaction in artificial photosynthesis and the conversion of light into stored chemical potential energy. While seemingly simple, the detailed mechanism of the light-driven generation of H2 is complex, particularly in an integrated system. In this project, the researchers focus on three specific research goals: the synthesis and characterization of new chromophores; the design and development of new catalysts containing common metal ions that are effective in photochemical systems for light-driven proton reduction in aqueous media; and the construction of new integrated proton reduction systems based on semiconductor materials such as SrTiO3, as structural scaffolds and on photocathode materials such as CuAlO2, to eliminate the need for chemical sources of electrons for proton reduction.  Each of these areas are being explored with cutting-edge femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy capable of probing dynamics involving initial light-driven events, longer duration transient absorption methods to follow later electron transfers and steady-state methods that can establish mechanisms of catalysis, molecular and interfacial structures, and long-term system stability.

The efficiency of this solar antenna is remarkable, and it is perhaps one of Nature's most spectacular molecular architectures.  While the light-harvesting complex has been studied extensively, the origin of its high efficiency has remained a mystery.  The problem is challenging. The light-harvesting complex not only consists of many individual molecules, but the structure is not rigid, and the molecular components are continually moving. The role that this motion plays in facilitating (or impeding) energy transport is unclear.  Through support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Eisele at The City College of New York (CCNY) is studying bio-inspired nanomaterials to elucidate Nature?s secret to efficient energy transport. Working together, Professor Eisele and her students are synthesizing new nanostructured molecular assemblies that mimic the features of the Nature's light-harvesting complex. They then watch the flow of energy through the assembly using sophisticated near-field scanning optical microscopies with the goal of understanding how structural fluctuations affect energy transport. The project could profoundly impact our understanding of natural photosynthetic systems, and could pave the way towards the design of efficient artificial systems for solar energy conversion applications.  In addition, the project is training the next generation of scientists in a broad range fields including nanoscience, spectroscopy and optical microscopy.  Through outreach activities, Professor Eisele and her students are working with middle- and high-school students, many from historically underrepresented minority groups, to produce short videos that highlight the challenges and opportunities of nanoscience, from everyday applications to the latest research in super-high resolution nanoimaging.<br/><br/>Conceptually, achieving a better understanding of excitation energy transfer (EET) processes in bio-inspired nanomaterials requires model systems that allow thorough testing of current theoretical models of energy transport phenomena. To this end, Professor Eisele is synthesizing well-defined model systems based on monomers such as amphiphilic cyanine dyes and porphyrin dyes. In solution the monomers self-assemble into supramolecular nanotubes that show collective optical properties (excitons) similar to the optical properties found in natural light-harvesting complexes. The nanotube assemblies are then encapsulated in transparent (non-excitonic) materials to mimic the surrounding proteins of the natural light-harvesting complex. The structural and optical properties of individual nanotubes are studied using near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) techniques, and the EET process is followed using femtosecond pump-probe techniques. The project is also integrating the pump-probe spectroscopies with NSOM methods, to enable direct observation of energy transport in an individual structure.

This approach is applied to two-dimensional atomic crystals including (but not limited to) single- and bi-layer graphene, phosphorene, and ZrTe5. The research team focuses on the impact of mechanical deformation (including uniaxial, shear and triaxial strains) on charge carrier scattering, valley polarization, band structure tuning, and topological transitions in these two-dimensional materials. The project advances the understanding in the fundamental physical properties of novel two dimensional materials and in modulating their electronic properties to study novel two-dimensional physics. Modification of lattice structure and/or symmetry can effectively create new artificial material systems which allow the study of novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional materials. This proposal, which focuses mainly on charge transport studies, directly addresses fabrication and measurement of the electronic devices. Hence, it further advances the concept of strain-tunable electronics beyond the previous efforts which are mainly based on optical and local probe studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research activities at Union College that require PXRD span the departments of mechanical engineering, physics and astronomy, chemistry and geology, and the interdisciplinary programs of nanoscience and environmental science, policy and engineering. The major fundamental scientific questions under investigation include: (1) How can the photo-efficiencies of thin film solar materials be improved? (2) How can new nanomaterials be used in applications such as protective coatings and nanoelectronics? (3) What role do interfacial molecules play in the phase transitions of nanomaterials? (4) How can better aerogel materials be created to reduce automotive pollution? (5) How can unwanted phase changes occurring in the production and storage of chocolate be minimized? (6) How old is the solar system and what is the composition of the deep Earth? (7) How do hydrothermal systems record volcanic activity? The research and research training to be enabled will further strengthen Union's longstanding commitment to incorporate research as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and to develop innovative, multidisciplinary research and teaching opportunities through state-of-the-art instrumentation. The instrument will be used in at least eight regularly offered courses serving approximately 180-200 students annually, nearly 10% of the student population. The instrument will fundamentally improve the way diffraction can be taught, allowing students to better engage with the concept of three-dimensional crystal structures and visualization. This new instrumentation will also serve as a bridge to link classroom and research experiences. The instrument will be used in over thirty undergraduate research projects annually, including many students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The mentoring students receive through their projects and courses will prepare students well to move on to either graduate school or productive careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports Union College to acquire a new powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) system with low angle and variable temperature capabilities that will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing research efforts by increasing instrument sensitivity, reducing collection times, adding a 2D detector and controlled sample environments, and providing a modern, more user friendly operating interface. The new PXRD platform affords versatile powder diffraction applications including phase identification, quantitative analysis, percent crystallinity, crystallite size and lattice strain analyses, particle size, precise lattice parameter determination, pole figures, and Rietveld refinement. A key advantage of the system is its high-speed detector, which is relatively maintenance free and requires no cooling, no detector gas, and no wire replacements. This diffractometer has automatic alignment, an advanced software system, and cross beam optics capability, that combine to create a flexible, intelligence-based data collection platform. In addition to supporting current research projects, this new instrument will allow the PI's to continue to develop new and innovative research programs that have potential to be transformative in areas of applied science related to sustainability and clean energy as well as in several subfields of fundamental science including condensed matter physics, materials chemistry, planetary science, and geochemistry. PXRD data will be published in peer-reviewed journals and undergraduate theses and presented at professional society conferences (e.g. the American Chemical Society, the Materials Research Society, the American Institute of Physics, the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, the Meteoritical Society, and the American Physical Society).

Many advancements in functionality of today's optical components are attained by using new or improved materials. The concept of metamaterials further enables this approach by offering artificially structured materials with properties absent in any natural materials system. One such unique engineered property, known as robustness, is found in specially designed structures referred to as topological metamaterials. Topological metamaterials allow guiding light with unprecedented insensitivity to obstacles and defects, inevitably present in any material or device, thus upending common notions of propagation and scattering of light. Most importantly, topological metamaterials offer a new platform for optical materials and devices exhibiting significantly higher tolerance to fabrication errors. In this project, we aim to design and test such optical devices, whose functionality is tolerant to both fabrication imperfections and environmental factors. This project is interdisciplinary in nature, bridging areas of fundamental and applied sciences. Significant outreach efforts towards high school and undergraduate minority students are planned. Activities for high school students from local schools include summer research conducted in the PI's laboratory through CCNY Summer Science Program.<br/><br/>Technical description: Topological photonics offers a fundamentally new vision on optical scattering, which may be exploited to manipulate the phase and amplitude of light in locally non-uniform ways. This suggests that open topological metamaterials with their topological modes leaking into a surrounding medium, such as two-dimensional metasurfaces patterned on the nanoscale, may offer new mechanisms of controlling scattering of light and thus enabling new approaches to generate desirable scattering patterns. On the other hand, the open character of the system, which renders photonic systems non-Hermitian, may itself affect topological properties of metamaterials in a nontrivial way. The goal of this project is to understand aspects of the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity, and to explore the limits of topological robustness in open systems. Our research reveals the role of leakage of topological modes into free-space, and of their interaction with incident light. Understanding these properties enables a new class of topological optical devices endowed with topological protection. Within this project we aim to design and test topological gratings, metasurfaces, flat-lenses, and vortex phase plates.  The proposed research plan bridges areas of fundamental and applied science, optics, photonics, and condensed matter physics. The project presents opportunities for students from high-school to the graduate level to get involved in all stages of research, and to obtain hands-on experience in photonic materials and devices. By opening opportunities in research on topological metamaterials to students, this project further attracts emerging generations to pursue careers in physics and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, having separate washer and dryer appliances allows clothes to be cleaned and dried simultaneously. While all-in-one washer/dryer appliances exist, they are less efficient, limiting the overall amount of laundry that can be done at one time. Cells use this same compartmentalization strategy to facilitate the hundreds of different processes that must take place concurrently to maintain life. However, cells must also be able to adapt to changing environments and growth conditions. To address this challenge, cells have certain compartments that responsively appear and disappear. These dynamic compartments form via a phase transition of cell contents - a process akin to liquid water freezing to form solid ice cubes. This project will engineer these dynamic compartments from the ground-up. Using inspiration from biological systems and guidance from polymer science, new dynamic compartments will be built in bacteria. A library of new biomaterials will be prepared and their phase transitions (""water freezing"") will be evaluated in test tubes and living cells. These efforts will provide a fundamental understanding of how cells form these responsive compartments and will enable us to efficiently engineer new processes in cells. This project also aims to educate and train a diverse set of students for careers in science and engineering. To do this, tutoring in STEM and a short course on the ""Art of Engineering"" will be developed for local incarcerated students.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Cells organize their contents from the molecular to the sub-cellular scale. The liquid-liquid phase separation of biomacromolecules has recently been appreciated as a mechanism for cellular subcompartmentalization. These phase separated compartments are termed membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates. This biological phase separation is driven by weak, multivalent interactions and shares many features with the well-studied phase separation of synthetic macromolecules (polymers). In particular, many membraneless organelles form via complex coacervation of nucleic acids and proteins - or the liquid-liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. The goal of this project is to use the process of complex coacervation to artificially promote globular protein phase separation in E. coli. The design parameters for the in vivo formation of both single and multi-protein condensates will be determined. Model fluorescent proteins will be engineered with altered charge and charge distribution to create a library of supercharged protein polyions. The phase behavior of these engineered proteins with oppositely charged biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins) will be characterized in vitro and in vivo. The insights from these experiments will enable the creation of synthetic membraneless organelles with potential applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. These research objectives will be coupled with educational goals to improve the scientific and engineering literacy of incarcerated students. Following STEM tutoring of students inside via existing outreach programs, a short course will be created on the ""Art of Engineering"" to introduce engineering concepts to these students and generate excitement about potential careers in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to study the properties and characteristics of this newly discovered particle as a laboratory to see if it behaves as the SM predicts or if there are deviations suggesting evidence for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is currently in the midst of Run 2, at almost twice the energy explored earlier and with significantly increased event samples.

Full understanding of binding interactions can require integrating large amounts of data collected using multiple analytical instruments and experimental protocols. Existing statistical methods and software do not fully integrate data from multiple sources to produce useful knowledge. The Minh/Chodera team is pioneering the use of a new approach (a ""Bayesian network"") as a general framework for analyzing chemical measurement data from multiple instruments and protocols and for designing new experiments. The framework is usable for both small laboratory experiments and the massive datasets generated by automated instrumentation. The software (including a straightforward user interface) is utilized to teach the underlying principles in related courses, and will be made freely available online, along with tutorials and clear documentation. <br/><br/>The Minh/Chodera team is developing chemometric methods and software for analyzing data related to binding. They are working to fuse data from diverse methods, including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), absorbance, fluorescence, and X-ray solution scattering. Key features of the software include automated parameter determination for physical binding models, and uncertainty propagation and quantification for model parameters. The research team also incorporates automated and principled model selection and hypothesis testing, and Bayesian experimental design to maximize acquisition of new information while minimizing cost. The software automatically constructs Bayesian networks that consider all sources of experimental error (e.g. dispensing, weighing, transfer, and measurement) for any experiment described by the Autoprotocol machine-readable standard. The software then performs Bayesian inference to weigh evidence for competing physical models, obtain credible intervals for thermodynamic and kinetic parameters, and propose new experiments. Robotic experiments, statistical inference, and Bayesian experimental design can be efficiently iterated to reduce model ambiguity and improve parameter precision. The team is using the software to advance knowledge of cooperativity between binding sites.

For many problems in practice, data is commonly associated with certain coherent and nonlinear structure. Mathematically, this allows us to model data sets as points sampled on manifolds usually of low dimensions embedded in a high dimensional ambient space. Different from image and signal processing which handle functions on flat domains with well-developed tools for processing and learning, manifold-structured data is far more challenging due to their complicated geometry. For example, the same geometric object can take very different coordinate representations due to the variety of embeddings, transformations or representations (imagine the same human body shape can have different poses as its nearly isometric embedding ambiguities). These ambiguities form an infinite dimensional isometric group and make higher-level tasks in manifold-structured data analysis and learning even more challenging. To overcome these challenges, it becomes increasingly important to develop new tools in both theoretical and computational point of views for processing manifold structured data. <br/><br/>This project proposes to investigate analyzing and learning of manifold-structured data by bridging connection from geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) and learning theory to intrinsic data analysis. The major objectives of this project contain three components. The first part is to investigate a framework of geometric-PDEs-based methods to a data structure for manifolds represented as incomplete inter-point distance. The second part is to overcome the challenge of poor performance using intrinsic descriptors to handling not nearly isometric manifolds. In the third part, a new method of defining geometric convolution on manifolds is considered. This provides a building block of constructing the proposed geometric convolutional neural network for conducting deep learning on manifold-structured data. By collaborating with biomedical engineers, applications such as human brain mappings will also be explored. The new methodologies and research findings resulting from the proposed work will lead to new ways of tackling problems in manifold-structured data analysis and will be integrated into my future teaching and course projects in appropriate ways. The education plan is to provide unique opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students interested in exploring geometry and learning on manifold-structured data, and to reach out the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scope includes: (a) outreach to underrepresented groups in STEM through creation of hands-on learning activities, videos and mentorship of K-12 students via an online learning portal; (b) expansion of polymer content and development of innovative curricula using evidence-based approaches such as primary literature in the classroom and student teaching in the context of service learning; and (c) mentoring through undergraduate and graduate polymer science research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>This work will integrate research, teaching, outreach and mentoring around elucidating the impact of uncontrolled nanoscale heterogeneities on the structure-property relationships of polymer gels. The objective is to map nanoscale variations in crosslink density of gels in real space and quantify the consequent non-affine deformation. These fundamental morphological studies will establish the contributions of network spatial heterogeneities to deviations from the predictions of classic theories of elasticity and reptation. The timeliness of the proposal draws on the recent ability of optical superresolution microscopies to non-destructively image the nanostructure of solvent-swollen polymer systems. The proposed work will answer an important scientific question -- what is the nanoscale structure of a gel -- and thus offer potential impact to a number of industries."

The focus is on lasers rather than more conventional means (e.g., an applied voltage, or changes in thermodynamic control variables) because lasers offer the possibility of change on an ultrafast timescale (on the order of a millionth of one billionth of a second). The Franco group investigates, for instance, the microscopic origin of the fastest existing method for the generation of currents, and the ability of lasers to turn insulating materials into transient metals. In addition to interest at a fundamental level, pushing the time limit in which electronic properties can be controlled has the potential to catalyze transformative progress in chemistry, spectroscopy, optoelectronic device design, communication through electrical signals, and any other science or technology based on electronic properties and their control. Professor Franco is impacting graduate education by redesigning the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry through active learning pedagogies. With this project, he contributes to the development of a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering workforce by creating summer research opportunities for top international undergraduate students in Chemistry at the University of Rochester.<br/><br/>Specifically, the Franco group advances the capabilities of using high and intermediate intensity ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate electronic properties and dynamics in nanoscale matter. The vision of the group is to establish structure-function relations that apply to matter driven far from equilibrium by laser fields, and to push the limit in which control of electrons is exerted. A fundamental limit that has historically hindered progress in the quantum control of electrons is the deleterious effects on the control introduced by ultrafast electronic decoherence processes arising from electron-nuclear interactions. To overcome this limit, Professor Franco and his research group: (i) Identify, model, and quantify basic mechanisms for electronic coherence loss, as a necessary step in the design of laser control scenarios that either avoid or take advantage of the decoherence. (ii) Develop novel routes for laser control of electrons based on the Dynamic Stark Effect induced by non-resonant laser fields of intermediate intensity (non-perturbative but non-ionizing) that are robust to decoherence. Together, these developments catalyze the design of novel control experiments, ultrafast opto-electronic technologies, and a new class of dynamic electronic materials with effective laser-induced properties tunable on a femtosecond timescale.  This project incorporates an integrated research and educational plan that provides students with a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary training and collaborative work at the interface between Chemistry, Physics, Nanoscience and Optics. The work impacts graduate education, through a proposed redesign of the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry by incorporating active learning pedagogies, such as flipped classrooms and peer learning problem solving sessions."

It is estimated that 30% of its volume is taken up by macromolecules, proteins and nucleic acids. While a small subset of these molecules can be interacting biochemically with a particular enzyme, the vast majority is chemically inert and is just occupying volume around the enzyme. The consequences of crowding are that more compact structures are favored in crowded media since they free up volume for the crowding molecules to occupy, thus increasing the overall entropy of the system. While this qualitative picture is simple and has borne out in some experiments, a more quantitative understanding of the consequences of crowding on protein function remains scanty, and more so in relation to molecular machines. This project will bring better quantitative understanding of crowding in cells using an experimental system that is amenable to precision measurements and manipulation of molecular motors. Recent studies have linked the down regulation of motor activity to various diseases. The rationale for the proposed studies is that the identification of the mechanisms by which multiple motors and motor co-factors cooperate to haul cargoes in the complex environment of the cell will lead to a fundamental framework for eventual understanding of how failure of these mechanisms is linked to disease. With the latter in mind, the impact of the project will in part be achieved by taking part in training a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students who are proficient in working in the interdisciplinary environment of the proposed activity and who  will advance the field as they proceed in their careers. The principal investigator has, and will continue to disseminate the findings of his research program among the general public through high school student internships in his laboratory and through lectures to the students, their parents and their teachers in area high schools. <br/><br/>The PI will use two such machines, the molecular motor proteins kinein-1 and cytoplasmic dynein, to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on the function of these enzymes. Motor proteins bind and shuttle cargo inside the cell by stepping along the cytoskeletal filaments. The motors choreographed mechano-chemical cycle has been well characterized in dilute buffer over the past three decades. A single step of a motor involves multiple events of ligand-substrate binding and conformational changes all of which can be modulated by crowders. Indeed, preliminary findings in the PI's lab show that kinesin motility is altered in the presence of crowders. The aims of the proposed work seek to determine the details of this altered function by probing and manipulating motors down to the single molecule level, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the consequences of the altered function of motors on emergent properties of multiple motors hauling cargo within the cell will be established. This work will also address the need to quantify crowding within the heterogeneous cellular makeup. To that end the PI will develop and calibrate a molecular sensor that can report on the local crowding state within the cell. The function of motors will be studied in their native environment as a function of crowding. A crowding sensor is a general tool that will be a crucial leap towards quantitative understanding of the role crowding plays in biological processes."

Each of these pulses provides a delta function-like kick to the qubit, inducing a complex trajectory on the Bloch sphere that is tailored to minimize leakage errors. In parallel, the team will employ a recently developed approach to qubit measurement based on the preparation of appropriate microwave cavity pointer states and microwave photon counting, combined with SFQ-based control, to implement low-latency feedback.

Carbenes are highly reactive groups with only two bonds to carbon instead of the usual four.  Cyclooctynes are the smallest cyclic compounds which can accommodate a carbon-carbon triple bond yet still be stable at room temperature.  These substances have relevance to chemical biology and materials science.  The combination of carbenes with cyclooctynes produces chemical reactions with unusual features of reactivity.

Importantly, the biochemical signals between cell and surrounding matrix are dynamic over multiple time (seconds-weeks) and length (nm-cm) scales, and are dependent on tissue stiffness. Therefore, materials engineered to modulate cell response must be similarly dynamic in their spatio-temporal presentation of bio-ligands and material stiffness. Although hydrogels that control spatial and temporal presentation of bio-ligands by use of external triggers have been realized, these hydrogels have not yet provided 3 key properties: a) spatial control of cell signaling, b) simultaneous temporal presentation of bio-adhesivity, and c) independent control of bio-adhesivity and material stiffness to parse individual contributions to cell modulation.

The approach can create extremely small patterns, down to a few tens of nanometers in size. Precise control of the shape and size of the objects it creates is also provided. Additionally, patterns can be printed over an entire surface cost-effectively.

The new techniques could advance the design of biomedical devices and other advanced manufacturing applictions. The research team is continuing their commitment to education and community outreach, with a particular emphasis on promoting women and under-represented minorities in science through innovative family-based learning activities and design projects. The educational broader impacts include the creation of hands-on learning activities, the development of educational videos, and the mentorship of K-12 students, all of which inspire and promote participation of under-represented students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The central goal of this research is to create 3D bicontinuous nanostructured materials using a combination of functional macromolecular chemistries and advanced optics, especially super-resolution optics and interference lithography.

Stochastic portfolio theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing portfolio behavior and equity market structure. It is descriptive as opposed to normative, consistent with observable characteristics of actual portfolios equity markets, and a theoretical tool useful for practical applications. In addition, it provides insights into questions of outperformance and arbitrage of market-structure stability, and of portfolio construction that results in controlled behavior over long-time horizons for purposes of institutional (for example, foundation, endowment, pension) investing. Stochastic control with partial observations arises in the sequential detection of change-points, in signal processing, in finance, in other contexts where learning about unknown parameters, and where dynamic optimization must take place simultaneously and in real time. Optimization problems that involve features of both control and stopping arise, for instance, in tracking models, where one has to stay as close as possible to a certain target by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived sufficiently close, and then to decide whether to engage the target or not. It also arises in situations where one has to resolve the tension between exploration (learning about unobservable quantities) and exploitation (taking an actions that costs now, but yields benefits later). The third focus of this project, the study of entropic gradient flows, complements the second law of thermodynamics and pertains to phenomena where the entropy of the current configuration, relative to the steady-state, not only decreases as the system approaches equilibrium, but does so in the most efficient manner possible ? the state follows a path of steepest possible descent for the entropy, in terms of an appropriate distance on phase space. This has important implications for the training of neural networks, for gradient descent algorithms in stochastic optimization, and for optimal portfolio liquidation. The award will provide graduate students with the opportunity for research experiences. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a theory of portfolios that does not rely on the existence of equivalent martingale measures and allows the outperformance of one portfolio by another. This theory will be based on local martingale deflators, the optional decomposition theorem, and appropriate functional-analytic tools. It will exclude only very egregious forms of what is commonly called arbitrage, and help develop a simple, streamlined mathematical framework for finance with complete answers to the basic questions of hedging and portfolio optimization. This theory will cover markets with an arbitrary number of assets (such as bond markets, or those with splits and mergers), open markets (with a fixed, finite number of companies but of a composition varying with capitalization, such as S&P 500), portfolio constraints, model uncertainty, and market stability via models based on systems of diffusions interacting through their ranks. The PI will work on stochastic optimization problems that combine features of optimal control, stopping, and filtering of unobservable parameters or signals. Such problems are notoriously hard to solve explicitly and little theory exists for them. Finally, the project will explore the full range of applicability for a tool the PI developed recently, using time-reversal and optimal transport techniques: the trajectorial approach to the Otto calculus. The PI will study its relevance for diffusions of McKean-Vlasov type, the training of deep neural networks, and the steepest descent of the relative entropy along flows of Markov processes, including on discrete structures with the help of appropriately weighted Sobolev norms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spatial array of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms of molecules is critical to the behavior of the molecules, specifically, their reactivity in different environments, and their ability to bind to other molecules. However, many natural and man-made molecules with potential uses as materials, catalysts, or pharmaceutical agents, are difficult to prepare using existing chemical protocols.  The research conducted by Professor Frontier and her students expands the range of three-dimensional molecules that can be assembled using chemical methods, and at the same time, develops chemical reactions that have not been previously described.  Through methods that form several new bonds in a single, controlled process, the group develops chemical strategies useful in a broad set of applications. Professor Frontier also continues to develop and maintain the ""Not Voodoo"" website, an educational resource.  The site is designed to help students demystify laboratory protocols and procedures. It serves hundreds of organic experimental chemists each day, from students just beginning independent research, to advanced students looking for more efficient synthetic methods. <br/><br/>Synthetic chemists are constantly searching for versatile new methods for building densely functionalized molecules containing bridged, spirocyclic and fused ring systems, ideally with heteroatoms embedded in the scaffold of the three-dimensional molecules. The new methods Professor Frontier and her students are studying simplify the synthesis of targets with unusual, densely functionalized ring systems, including cycloheptane systems and nitrogen-rich heterocycles.  Novel pericyclic reactions are being developed in the context of reaction cascades that build complex ring systems from simple precursors, with the formation of up to three carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen bonds in one synthetic operation.  Given the stereochemical control imparted by these pericyclic processes, the work represents efforts to develop efficient, stereoselective reaction sequences while garnering a new understanding of the factors critical to successful multi-step processes with pericyclic components.

Barnes at Siena College to study how peptide molecules fall apart or stick to surfaces following high-energy collisions in the gas phase. Such collisions occur when molecules are being analyzed using instruments called mass spectrometers, which identify molecules and their fragments according to their mass and electric charge. The accuracy of the mass spectral analysis depends on how well the collisions are understood. This project examines the importance of the molecular shape and of common biological modifications on the collisions and the molecular products generated by the collisions. Proteins are synthesized in living cells by molecular machines called ribosomes, which translate the information stored in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) into proteins. Modifications of the proteins after translation are called ""post-translational"" modifications (PTMs). Prof. Barnes is especially interested in how the PTMs affect the outcomes of gas phase collisions. This project actively involves undergraduate student researchers who are cross-trained in both theoretical and experimental methods and have the opportunity to present their results at national conferences and other scientific meetings. <br/><br/>A combined computational and experimental approach is taken that focuses on model systems relevant to tandem mass spectrometry (MS2). In particular, a range of protonated peptides and their post-translationally modified versions are selected to investigate the impact of secondary structure on soft landing and collision-induced dissociation. The study elucidates the importance of non-covalent interactions and complex formation of peptide fragments. Methods include direct dynamics simulations, ab initio calculations, rate calculations, and experimental tandem mass spectrometry.  In addition to the fundamental insights gained regarding molecular collisions and reactions, the project has direct implications for the optimization of mass spectrometric experiments on biomolecules and the interpretation of the resulting data.  In turn, the research may have important implications for a wider range of biological and health-related sciences.  Collaboration with Prof. Julia Laskin at Purdue University is providing valuable experience in the large research university context for Prof. Barnes' Siena College student researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. The proposed research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. The first real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes are just beginning to occur with experiments like LIGO. To confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO observes the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy.  Mergers of binary systems containing neutron stars can lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, as well as gravitational waves.  In one spectacular case so far, such an event has been detected by LIGO with gravitational waves, and also all across the electromagnetic spectrum. As more of these events are seen, better simulations are needed to help determine the parameters of these binaries and the characteristics of these signals (timescale, strength, etc.). The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand. Relativity and black holes continue to fascinate the public and allow science to be communicated broadly. Movies of simulations produced by the investigators will continue to provide public outreach.<br/><br/>To solve Einstein's equations, the investigators will use high-accuracy computational techniques suited to the mathematical properties of the equations. These methods solve the equations at a much smaller computational cost than other techniques.  One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes.  A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. The investigators will include ever more realistic descriptions of the microphysics in the simulations, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter, neutrino effects,and magnetic fields. The investigators will also develop a new code for computational astrophysics that is designed to take advantage of upcoming exascale machines in a way that current codes cannot.  This new code will be based on discontinuous Galerkin methods and task-based parallelism. It will provide transformative capabilities not only for numerical relativity, but for many problems in computational astrophysics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proton therapy for cancer treatment and food irradiation to eliminate pathogens are among the most remarkable applications. These successes are paving the way for new applications for particle accelerators, such as materials science experiments and nuclear waste transmutation, which would require much more intense beams than are currently available. A difficulty is that at such high beam intensities, beam induced damages on the accelerator structures cannot be tolerated. Achieving a high beam quality throughout the acceleration process thus becomes a critical issue. The dynamics of beams in accelerators is described by equations which can only be accurately solved with long and expensive simulations run on supercomputers. Accelerator design studies therefore involve time consuming, computer intensive simulations, limiting the range of design options which can be investigated. This project addresses this limitation by developing a numerical method that will significantly reduce the run times of existing numerical codes while maintaining a high level of accuracy. By accelerating beam dynamics simulations in accelerators, the new solver will help improve design optimization for the next generation of high intensity accelerators.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to develop new methods to predict the dynamics of high intensity beams in cyclotrons. The beam dynamics is described by the Vlasov equation, a six-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation, and quantitative results can only be obtained through numerical simulation. Particle codes based on the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm have been successfully used for this purpose. Still, a limitation of these codes is that a large number of particles need to be followed to limit statistical error, which leads to long run times. To reduce run times, the PI and graduate students will develop a novel noise reduction technique for the standard PIC algorithm, based on the use of sparse grids. In order to maximize the leverage from this new technique, they will implement high performance algorithms in their sparse-PIC solver, and optimize the sparse grids using model reduction techniques tailored for cyclotron simulations. At every stage of the development of the solver, they will compare the performance of the new code with the state-of-the-art code OPAL. The code will be available to collaborators at major cyclotron facilities to answer unresolved questions regarding the stability of high intensity beams in cyclotrons and to design new machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These futuristic ideas are currently science fiction, but if we have any hope of creating these amazing technologies, we need to begin today. This collaborative project seeks to explore the fundamental underpinnings of the materials needed for such applications. Specifically, in order to design any of these futuristic devices, we need to have materials that are self-powered and assembled hierarchically from energy-using building blocks. Luckily, many biological systems, such as cells, plants, and humans, are already capable of sensing their environment and responding by moving, changing shape, or releasing chemicals. The basic building blocks of these biological ?systems? are enzymes, nanoscale machines made of protein that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In order to dissect and begin to create an understanding of how enzymes can animate matter, our team will use enzymes to power new synthetic materials at the nanoscale to microscale. In the future, these nanoscale materials can be assembled themselves to create new larger scale active materials. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The scientific objective of this project is to understand the physics of synthetic active materials powered by enzymes. The research team combines expertise in DNA nanotechnology, enzyme kinetics, single-particle tracking, and sensitive force measurements to address the following objectives: (1) The team uses DNA origami to design, create, and characterize a suite of active particles, driven by enzyme catalysis, with programmable size, shape, flexibility, and location of propulsive enzymes. This objective addresses a need to create new nano- to mesoscale active particles and uses these particles to understand the mechanisms governing enhanced motility. (2) The team characterizes the properties of an active bath of enzyme-driven particles via the fluctuation spectrum, dissipation of energy, and the ability of an active bath to propel passive particles to extract work from noise. A combined study of the single-particle motility and the active fluctuations that emerge from collections of active particles will reveal a wealth of new information, including the mechanisms of enhanced transport of active particles, as well as a non-equilibrium statistical mechanical description of active fluctuations. The importance of this approach lies in the potential to specify the microscopic details of active particles, like their size, shape, and flexibility, and then to discover how these attributes alter the single-particle and collective behaviors.<br/><br/>This DMR grant supports research to understand the physics of synthetic active materials powered by enzymes with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and Biomaterials (BMAT) Programs in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This line of research is extremely important in the development of new optical devices, and has not yet been adequately pursued and understood. This project is transformative, as it will open new avenues for utilizing dopants to design and synthesize optical and photonic materials with new capabilities and functionalities. The research has potential impacts on a wide range of important applications, including laser machining and manufacturing, laser-sparked fusion energy, laser communications, high-energy particle and radiation detection, medical imaging, etc. The project has developed an educational program called Collaborative Exchange Research and Materials in Ceramic Sciences (CERAMICS) to help students gain research experience abroad, primarily in Asian countries, through an exchange program. This experience provides students with a more global view of research activities. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The overall objective of this CAREER project is to address the fundamental materials science questions associated with using off-valence ion substitution to control the valency of dopant ions in laser and optoelectronic materials. To answer these questions, a thorough understanding of the formation, stability, and manipulation of cation defects and ionic valencies in select materials is being developed. Specifically, the intention of this project is to study the mechanisms by which the valencies of dopant ions can be tuned, by controlling the local oxidizing or reducing environment. Modification of local environments can generate different electronic and coordination structures, which changes the behavior of the optically-active ion centers in a material. This project applies simulation methods to study models with different dopants and/or combinations of dopants to predict possible spectroscopic properties. Electron microscopy is used to examine the distribution of dopants and vacancies in different materials, and to determine the location of substitutional ions; whether they exist in lattice sites or are segregated at grain boundaries. This work brings about unique opportunities to design new optical materials for applications in next generation devices such as ceramic lasers and scintillation detectors. The project also includes a dedicated enhanced educational experience for students, which trains future generations of optical and photonic materials engineers."

Inspired by biology, this project embellishes microscopic oil droplets with specific DNA interactions that guide their spontaneous assembly into complex, 3D architectures. These structures range from unusual crystals to helices with exciting optical properties due to their interaction with light. These droplets can readily be solidified, therefore they offer a route to programmable, hands-off manufacturing, with high yield of the desired material.

This versatile system allows us to control the fluidity, specificity, valency, and logical programming of interactions between droplets, which in turn facilitates the assembly of complex structures, including emulsion polymers, loops and folded configurations. In this project, we propose 1) to use multiple flavors of DNA grafted on emulsions to program the structure of matter on the micro-scale, 2) to study the folding dynamics of the pathways in search of organizing principles and 3) to use the assembled components for further assembly into large-scale materials. This 'beads-on-a-string' experimental model is analogous to protein folding on the molecular scale, but provides visual access to the chain dynamics as it folds. A major goal of this project is to integrate science education and research within the laboratory and beyond.

Key genes and regulators of the cell cycle process, critical to guaranteeing normal cellular function, are  identified through computational analysis, for comparison with experimental data.

The interdisciplinary nature of the research is providing opportunities for training students from different backgrounds in a mutual learning, collaborative environment, preparing them to tackle problems at the nexus of these fields.<br/><br/>The study of the cell cycle is essential to understanding the life of a single cell, the basic unit of living systems. The global dynamical theory that Professor Wang and his group are developing models the underlying gene regulatory network of the cell as a chemical reaction network, with gene expression levels playing the role of chemical state concentrations. The driving forces for transitions between gene expression states originate in a combination of a nonequilibrium effective potential determined by the steady state probability and the rotational steady state flux between states of the system. The steady state probability flux quantifies the extent of nonequilibriumness and irreversible behavior, and provides the bridge for describing the thermodynamics of the system in terms of its dynamics. The project is investigating the development of a dynamical systems model of the cell cycle in terms of the gene regulatory network.  Researchers are also developing a nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory of the cell cycle in terms of energy input, energy cost, and entropy production.  The team also couples the dynamical systems and nonequilibrium dynamics models to enable predictions of biological observables such as cell cycle speed, coherence, with utilization of sensitivity analysis to identify key genes and regulators. Model predictions are being compared against time-dependent in vivo fluorescence measurements of gene expression dynamics and correlations from experimental collaborator Jie Xiao. The nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamic theory is general and can be applied to cell cycle processes in different organisms and associated underlying regulatory networks.

The group has contributed to a measurement of the differential cross section for production of high momentum top/antitop quark pairs, supported the CMS data preservation efforts with brand new educational tools, restarted an effort to search for baryon-number violating (BNV) decays of the top quark, and engaged local high school teachers and their students to teach them about this exciting work. The group now leads efforts to search for BNV decays of the top quark with Run II data, developing novel approaches along the way. New efforts in data preservation and speculative dark matter searches are also part of this project. Siena will continue this effort primarily to use these data for education, outreach, and training.<br/><br/>The observed matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe is 8 orders of magnitude larger than can be accommodated by the combination CP violation in the quark sector and baryon-number violating processes allowed in the Standard Model. The most striking consequence of this would be proton decay, but extensive searches for this process have yielded no signal. If BNV is mediated by a boson that operates through a more complicated flavor/generation structure, then it may manifest more strongly in higher generation quarks and leptons. The Siena group will expand the search for BNV decays of the top quark, any observation of which would transform particle physics. The nature of dark matter is one of the most significant outstanding questions in physics and a key missing element of the Standard Model. The Siena group will carry out new speculative dark matter searches in which the CMS detector is used in a direct detection mode, looking for large deposits of energy not associated with a bunch crossing, and in indirect detection mode, searching for standard model particles pointing up from the ground and originating from the decay of dark matter particles gravitationally trapped in the Earth.<br/><br/>Through this project, Siena College students have the opportunity to contribute to physics analyses and to present their work at conferences and carry out their research at major world laboratories. These efforts will focus on both exciting the general public about what humanity is learning about Nature and how the Universe works, but also on encouraging young people to consider careers in STEM fields. The Siena group emphasizes reaching out to women and other traditionally underrepresented groups in physics in local high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly the case in the sciences, where advances in experimental methodology across fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics have led to an explosion of different types of data, collected by different measurement apparatuses at potentially different times. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to connect data points from different experiments. For example, a chemist may apply two different measurement techniques to the same batch of molecules to obtain high-quality data about the whole batch, but it may be challenging to track the identities of particular molecules between measurements. The statistician who wishes to make the best possible inferences is faced with the difficult problem of how to integrate the data from different sources to conduct a unified analysis. Despite the ubiquity of this problem, rigorous statistical analyses of procedures designed to work with decoupled data are rare. The main goal of this project is to develop new tools for performing estimation tasks with decoupled data and to establish the fundamental limits of such techniques. This project will have impact on scientific and statistical methodology in both research and industrial settings.The graduate student support will be used on interdisciplinary research and writing codes.<br/> <br/>The project will investigate optimal rates of estimation for regression problems given access to decoupled data, and to establish potential trade-offs. Several intermediate regimes will be considered, for example, where the experimenter has access to many independent batches of shuffled data or to data with partial coupling information. This project will quantify the statistical price for learning with decoupled data via tight minimax bounds. This research is also aimed at establishing when minimax statistical procedures can be made computationally efficient, and investigating the possible presence of information theoretic-computational gaps in optimal rates of estimation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But upon closer examination, there is a great deal of variability in their ability to conduct charge, and much of this is unexplained. For instance, in cobalt manganese oxides the conductivity can increase up to 10 times depending on the cobalt to manganese ratio. The existing theories are accurate when there are only two components, for instance, just cobalt and oxygen, but when a third component is included, the theories break down. In this project, the team is investigating a fundamental question of oxides: how does atomic disorder affect conductivity in oxides. By elucidating these mechanisms, the team is opening up new avenues to tailor the conductivity in oxides, important for applications that rely on the insulating properties of oxides, as in semiconductor transistors, or for applications that could benefit from increased conductivity, as in batteries and fuel cells. To disseminate and promote science to the public the team is creating a website with on-line training videos to strengthen international science outreach and the US-Israel partnership using science for peaceful purposes, and the team is designing a module on electronic conductivity in oxides for Lending Library Experiments. The kit aligns with specific Next Generation Science Standards and uses exploratory hands-on activities to help experiential learning.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate a fundamental question in ternary oxides: how do charge carriers move through a spinel crystal lattice when there is more than one type of cation. It is known that the most prominent mechanism of charge transport in oxides is through hopping that follows the polaron models. But the polaron hopping models are too crude to account for the configurational differences that occur in ternary transition metal spinels, where the two different cation types can exhibit large degrees of disorder between the two cation lattice sites and possess a variety of oxidation states. As a consequence, the effects of cation disorder and cation oxidation states on electronic conductivity has not been well-described in multinary spinels. To investigate this question the team is synthesizing ternary oxide spinels, characterizing the cation disorder, and correlating the disorder with the electronic transport. The team is using x-ray emission spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark-field imaging, and electron energy loss spectroscopy to determine site occupancy, oxidation states, and local atomic segregation. The experimental results are coupled with theory to understand the mechanisms and outline a global model for transport. The team is using DFT-type calculations with periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions, and is analyzing charge transport characteristics related to hopping mechanisms in oxide materials to determine if the charge carriers lie on delocalized (overlapping) or localized states for specific cation distributions and concentrations. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of polarons is a grand challenge for fields including molecular architectures, and electrical energy storage, where details of charge transport in poor electron-conductor materials could have a large impact. Understanding the relationship between cation configurational disorder and polaron hopping could lead to designer oxides with tailored properties. The team is promoting science to the public by creating a website with on-line training videos for international science outreach and to strengthen the US-Israel partnership using science for peaceful purposes, and designing an experiment on electronic conductivity in oxides for Lending Library Experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When scientists study materials that are very, very small (so-called ""nanoparticles"") they find that the properties are radically different from bulk properties.  One of the surprising differences in nanoparticles is that the atoms can rearrange themselves much faster and easier than expected. Chemists have taken advantage of this effect to modify nanoparticles through chemical transformation reactions.  These chemical transformation reactions have opened up exciting new opportunities because they offer the ability to independently manipulate the size, shape, atomic structure, or chemical composition in nanoparticles, overcoming limitations of conventional synthesis techniques.  In this project, Dr. Richard Robinson is investigating one type of chemical transformation, the ion exchange reaction, by using an advanced experimental method called x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).  XAS enables the precise measurement of the local environment around an atom and thereby helps discover how the atomic lattice changes during the ion exchange reaction.  To understand why the ion exchange process is orders of magnitude faster in nanomaterials than in bulk materials, Dr. Robinson is investigating key phenomena such as the size dependence of diffusion in nanoparticles and the stoichiometry and stability of the atomic phase (crystal lattice) during transformation.  By learning how to manipulate nanoparticles through chemical transformations, this project is benefiting society by creating a toolkit to tailor nanoparticles for advanced applications in areas such as electronics, catalysis, and photovoltaics. The project broadly impacts chemistry by spurring new synthetic approaches to nanoparticles with novel composition and structure. Dr. Robinson is developing an outreach module that teaches students about nanomaterial properties. Dr. Robinson is training high school teachers to use the ""nano demo"" kit and is making the kit available through a lending library. Dr. Robinson's local and regional outreach efforts include mentoring graduate students through the Sloan Diversity Fellows Program, and involving undergraduates in research activities.<br/><br/>Ion exchange reactions, a subset of the chemical transformation reactions, are a powerful method to atomically restructure the composition and phase of first-generation (as-synthesized) nanoparticles. What is currently unknown is how ion dynamics behave differently at the nanoscale than at bulk scales. The key challenges to understanding the ion exchange process include characterizing the size dependence of diffusion in nanoparticles, the influence of reaction kinetics on the ion dynamics, and the stoichiometry and stability of the atomic phase (crystal lattice) during transformation. To investigate these challenges, Dr. Robinson is performing in-situ and ex-situ XAS of nanoparticles during cation and anion exchange, and mapping the movements of the ions and the atomic structure. By combining time-resolved XAS, long-range order characterization, and elemental analysis, Dr. Robinson is characterizing the governing atomic dynamics, the dynamic changes in oxidation states, and the coordination chemistry that occurs during ion exchange in nanoparticles. Dr. Robinson is exploiting these reactions to create advanced nano-heterostructures, metastable phases, and doped nanoparticles. By understanding how to manipulate nanoparticles through chemical transformations, this project benefits society by creating a toolkit to tailor nanoparticles for advanced applications in areas such as electronics, catalysis, and photovoltaics."

Dr. Jones is studying the individual steps of the reaction cycle.  These catalytic reactions have applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and may also provide a better understanding of how electrical energy from hydropower or wind turbines could be captured and stored for later use on demand.

The group is examining stoichiometric reactions for alcohol and amine dehydrogenation with various quinones as hydrogen acceptors.  The group is also developing electrochemical recycling of the hydroquinone hydrogen acceptors. By proper choice of solvent and electrolyte, an electrochemical route for dehydrogenations is being extended to substrates that can produce heterocycles such as indoles and quinolones.  Finally, this electrochemical method is being used in applications for dehydrogenation of activated C-C bonds to generate oxidized organic products that serve as building blocks in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects called varieties, created by equations that are built from addition and multiplication. Symplectic geometry involves geometric objects related to classical mechanics. We are interested in `topological' properties of some of these varieties such as how many `holes' they have and `enumerative' properties such as the number of curves they contain. The PI is interested in pairs of varieties which are birational to each other, which means that they become identical after removing smaller varieties. We wish to know what topological or enumerative properties they have in common. One of the main aims of this project is to see how tools from symplectic geometry can be used to investigate such issues. The PI believes these ideas are new and can be used to explore other areas of algebraic and symplectic geometry using this different perspective. The PI will help out with a program involving high school students called Seawolf math, and will also help out with a math summer camp for high school students at Stony Brook. The PI will also help out in workshops designed for graduate students learning closely related fields of study.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to understand the relationship between birational geometry and certain Floer theoretic invariants.  These invariants include symplectic/contact cohomology, Floer cohomology of a symplectomorphism and the Fukaya category. The PI will use these Floer invariants to prove certain statements related to birational geometry.  One of the main goals of this NSF funded project is to give a completely new approach to the crepant resolution conjecture using an extended version of symplectic cohomology. The PI will prove a weak version of this conjecture using these methods. The PI believes these methods point to certain generalizations of this conjecture. The PI will study terminal 3-fold singularities and also Newton non-degenerate singularities using Floer theory. Studying such singularities could lead to new insights just as studying quotient singularities led the PI to study the crepant resolution conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manifolds and their geometric properties are not only central to various branches of mathematics but also are ubiquitous as mathematical models in the sciences. Perhaps the greatest example of this is in general relativity, where one of Einstein's great breakthroughs was the discovery that gravity is modeled by the mathematical notion of curvature. This research project focuses on curvature of Riemannian manifolds.  Specific emphasis will be placed on manifolds with density, which can be envisioned as Riemannian manifolds composed of a material with variable, as opposed to uniform, density.  Despite the appearance of manifolds with density in various areas of mathematics and applications, including proof of the Poincare conjecture, they are not yet well understood. This project addresses this gap by helping to develop a geometric theory of manifolds with density.  The project also uses geometry as a theme for a coherent program of educational activities that include: (1) professional development workshops in teaching and learning for in-service secondary education teachers, which will help support teachers in transition to recently developed K-12 standards; (2) innovation in introductory differential geometry curricula at the undergraduate and graduate level that, by emphasizing applications, will also foster new interaction between mathematics and science researchers; and (3) training of mathematics graduate students in best strategies for engaging students in introductory calculus courses.<br/> <br/>Ricci curvature for manifolds with density has been an active area of recent research.  This includes Ricci solitons, which are both fixed points of the Ricci flow and examples of spaces with constant weighted Ricci curvature, and the study of weighted Ricci curvature bounds. The investigator will continue study of the classification of shrinking Ricci solitons in dimension four and higher.  In addition to playing a key role in development of monotonic functionals for the Ricci flow, weighted Ricci curvature bounds also appear in the theory of optimal transport, isoperimetric inequalities, and general relativity and cosmology.   Despite the vast amount of research in Ricci curvature of manifolds with density, there was no corresponding theory of weighted sectional curvature until recently; another goal of this project is to further develop the theory of weighted sectional curvature bounds, including investigating applications and connections to other areas of mathematics.  Recent collaborative work of the investigator also introduces a new geometric approach to manifolds with density that places a certain torsion free affine connection as the fundamental object of study.   This approach not only provides new insight into the weighted Ricci and sectional curvatures but also suggests new natural structures that promise novel results, such as a weighted holonomy group, which will be investigated."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award supports the US groups involved in the XENON1T dark matter search program at the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) underground laboratory.<br/><br/>The XENON project continues to captivate the imagination of the public. This is evidenced, for example, by several TV shows such as ""The Big Bang Theory"", which on several occasions featured XENON plots and results. Public interest in science is encouraged through talks and outreach activities. XENON1T will play a significant role in solving the dark matter puzzle, by either detecting WIMPs, or putting them under immense pressure as viable dark matter candidates. In addressing this fundamental physics problem, these awards will engage many undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers, exposing them to a variety of subjects in physics and cosmology, and training them in state-of-the-art technologies, thus preparing to become future leaders in the field. Finally, the instrumentation and techniques used in XENON are relevant to a wide range of applications, from areas in homeland security and medical imaging, to the analysis and statistical treatment of large data sets.<br/><br/>The program for the next four years will focus on the continued operation of the XENON1T experiment and its science data analysis.

While the Gaussian distribution emerges universally from probabilistic models exhibiting independence, random matrix statistics appear from correlated systems, so that the scope of their applications have considerably expanded recently. For example, integrable systems, growth models, analytic number theory and quantum mechanics exhibit random matrix statistics. Moreover, random matrix techniques have improved our theoretical understanding of numerical analysis and deep learning networks. <br/><br/>Methods from probability (random walks and coupling), analysis (homogenization) and mathematical physics (loop equations) were recently advanced in connection with spectral analysis of random matrices, to prove eigenvalues and eigenvectors universality. The PI will further develop such tools for the following problems: <br/>(1) Delocalization for band matrices. The PI aims at understanding universality beyond mean field models. One key question concerns band matrices in dimension 1 up to the ``Anderson'' transition. A recent approach to this problem involves a mean field reduction and the connection with quantum unique ergodicity, and it will be developed further; <br/>(2) Universality of extremal statistics.  This includes extreme spectral spacings, large values of the characteristic polynomial, fluctuations of individual eigenvalues and more generally universal aspects of log-correlated random fields;<br/>(3) Coulomb gases, the Gaussian free field and Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Recent progress gave convergence of the electric field of 2D Coulomb gases to the Gaussian free field. A natural extension concerns convergence of the characteristic polynomial to Gaussian multiplicative chaos;<br/>(4) Eigenvectors of non-Hermitian random matrices. Physicists predicted in the 1990s the typical size of overlaps between eigenvectors from the Ginibre ensemble. This was recently upgraded to an explicit limiting distribution of diagonal overlaps, and to correlations of off-diagonal overlaps. Extension of this new integrability to the joint law of all overlaps will be studied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award supports the US groups involved in the XENON1T dark matter search program at the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) underground laboratory.<br/><br/>The XENON project continues to captivate the imagination of the public. This is evidenced, for example, by several TV shows such as ""The Big Bang Theory"", which on several occasions featured XENON plots and results. Public interest in science is encouraged through talks and outreach activities. XENON1T will play a significant role in solving the dark matter puzzle, by either detecting WIMPs, or putting them under immense pressure as viable dark matter candidates. In addressing this fundamental physics problem, these awards will engage many undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers, exposing them to a variety of subjects in physics and cosmology, and training them in state-of-the-art technologies, thus preparing to become future leaders in the field. Finally, the instrumentation and techniques used in XENON are relevant to a wide range of applications, from areas in homeland security and medical imaging, to the analysis and statistical treatment of large data sets.<br/><br/>The program for the next four years will focus on the continued operation of the XENON1T experiment and its science data analysis. The international XENON Collaboration of 130 scientists continues to be led by the PI at Columbia University with key roles served by US members both in the management of the experiment and its scientific program. XENON1T uses the largest liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) built to-date, with 2 tonnes active Xe target, and the highest sensitivity to dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), at the level of 2  10^-47 cm^2 for 40 GeV WIMPs. With funding of this proposal, the US will remain in the lead of the direct search for dark matter well beyond the end of the decade."

Evans at CUNY - Queens College and Professor Gary L. Findley at the University of Louisiana-Monroe to undertake complementary experimental and theoretical studies of the role of solvent structure in important chemical reactions.  Their work seeks improved understanding upon which to base better, more efficient, and less environmentally invasive chemical manufacturing and processing.  It is congruent with the aims of sustainable chemistry, including the principles that the use of solvents should be made unnecessary wherever possible, and solvents should be innocuous when used.   By involving graduate and undergraduate students from CUNY as well as undergraduates from Louisiana - Monroe (many of whom are from low-income families and are first generation college students), the work makes available exciting research opportunities intended not only to advance science, but to retain student interest and expand capabilities in STEM fields.  Some of the research utilizes synchrotron facilities at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in Baton Rouge, LA, allowing all participating students to interact with scientists from a high caliber user facility, while introducing CUNY students to new aspects of United States culture in a Living/Learning community environment. The requirement that Monroe participants present their research results at Queens College ensures that these students will be exposed to a major urban environment -a first for many of these students.<br/><br/>The research specifically focuses on solvation of quasi-free electrons as probes of the solvent structure in the target media across the broad temperature and density range represented by these solvents.  The systems chosen for study include supercritical carbon dioxide, high temperature water, and supercritical water.  These solvents are targeted because their solvation properties can be adjusted by small changes in temperature and pressure, potentially enabling product isolation and solvent purification in a single step.  A free electron in solution makes an ideal probe of local solvent structure, and will help illuminate reactivity in these important media. Electrons with low energies are produced by field-enhanced photoemission from electrode surfaces in the solvent and the resulting current is detected with a second electrode.  Experiments are being conducted at a new synchrotron facility at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in Baton Rouge, LA, and the resulting data are used to develop empirical models for the microscopic structure of the supercritical solvent systems."

The Principal Investigator (PI) will study basic mathematical objects by studying their symmetries, and by studying how the objects change under transformations: this is the study of group actions.  The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.  When the objects of interest are highly complex or not easily parametrized, these problems are difficult to approach, and the PI's program centers on several new techniques to render rigidity problems tractable.  The project also involves the introduction of active-learning courses for undergraduate mathematics students, including a program to train graduate students in teaching methods, and a major workshop on effectively communicating mathematics across research areas with the aim of increasing communication between mathematicians in disparate fields.  <br/><br/><br/>A major guiding principle in the PI's work is that rigidity of group actions, in the sense of topological dynamics, is often the result of an underlying geometric structure. One example of this phenomenon is the PI's recent results on foliated circle bundles over surfaces, where it is shown that every rigid such bundle is geometric. This project builds on this success of this program, extending this theme to new contexts and applications. The PI will continue work on flat bundles and rigid monodromy group actions, using techniques from foliation theory and coarse geometry in negative curvature to study boundary actions.  Another strand of this project involves an investigation of rigidity of infinite discrete groups acting on the circle through the topology of spaces of circular orders, following work of A. Navas.  Finally, the PI will adapt techniques from geometric group theory to the new context of non-locally compact groups, applying this this to study the dynamics of group actions on surfaces, and refining the notion of distortion and growth in transformation groups introduced by Gromov.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theory is among the oldest branches of mathematics; its applications to technology are prevalent and vital for communication systems, data processing, and computational algorithms. The goals of this project are driven by landmark problems on arithmetic families. Families arise when assembling and studying together objects that share common features. Families are often crucial even if one is a priori interested in a single object and thereby are central to the recent resolution of certain difficult algebraic and asymptotic questions. These goals of the project are complemented by concrete initiatives targeted at undergraduate and graduate education that are centered on developing effective writing and communication skills. In collaboration with the Institute for Writing at Cornell University, the PI will organize a monthly seminar on writing, regular writing groups, and an online wiki that will serve as a communication platform and access to resources for the general public. The PI will continue to mentor undergraduate research projects, disseminating knowledge and discoveries while promoting learning through the investigation of open problems.<br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a quantitative theory of the asymptotics of special functions, such as characters of representations. The long-term goal is to solve problems on automorphic periods, subconvexity and non-vanishing of L-functions, and arithmetic statistics of families.  The trace formula is a fundamental tool in number theory and the development of the Langlands program in particular. Even though there has been enormous progress, important questions remain open, notably analytic aspects that are critical for many applications. These questions are now ripe for investigation following the works of Arthur and others. An immediate outcome of this research is a Sato-Tate equi-distribution theorem for families of Maass forms on GL(n), resolving a long-standing problem.  The understanding of the absolute convergence of the geometric side of the trace formula is currently one of the most urgent problems in the subject. A second focus is on trace characters, which are a central concern in representation theory, such as the local Langlands correspondence and functorial transfers. The PI will work on quantitative aspects that have seen little progress since the seminal work of Harish-Chandra. Related to this, the PI will continue work on Whittaker periods, notably towards a conjecture of Zuckerman on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. The proposed activity is to bring methods from analysis, geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics in their full strength, notably symplectic geometry and integrable systems; an immediate goal is the systematic study of the quantitative aspects of coadjoint orbits."

Although there are a billion neutrinos for every more well-known electron or proton, neutrinos interact only via the so-called ""weak"" force: so they rarely bump into anything, even the detectors designed to study them. That means they are also the least well understood of the fundamental particles.  One of the big mysteries in neutrino science is how they change (or ""oscillate"") from one type to another. The study of neutrinos has progressed rapidly over the past 25 years. The ultimate goal of neutrino oscillation experiments such as this is to determine whether neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently. This can tell us about the evolution of the universe a fraction of a second after the big bang, and provide clues about why the universe is currently filled with matter and not anti-matter.<br/><br/>Neutrino oscillation experiments produce neutrinos in one particular type (referred to as flavor), which is measured at a near detector close to the neutrino production point, and search for the disappearance of this flavor and/or the appearance of a new neutrino flavor at a far detector. The NuPRISM detector, which this award will develop, is a new type of near detector that measures the produced neutrinos over a wide range of angles, which provides a method for measuring the energy of the neutrinos with unprecedented precision. This new technique has the potential to extend the reach of current and future neutrino oscillation experiments.This project includes enrichment activities for high school students interested in pursuing careers in STEM fields. Students from local school districts will be selected to spend a day at Stony Brook University learning about scientific research, attending demonstrations, and meeting with graduate students and faculty."

This has resulted in massive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a potent greenhouse gas, to the environment. There is an urgent need to mitigate the negative impacts of these emissions on the environment. Efficient utilization of CO2 to produce chemicals and fuels is one potential solution. This research project is examining the conversion of CO2 to light olefins. Olefins are important chemicals and raw materials heavily used for the packaging, plastic processing, construction, and textile industries. The huge market demand for light olefins offers a great opportunity for this project to significantly impact CO2 utilization technology. While significant advances have been made, considerable challenges remain for the discovery and development of practical catalysts for this transformation. In this project, Professor Cheng Zhang of the Long Island University (Post), New York is developing a new approach using carbon nanosphere (CNS) encapsulated metal catalysts for CO2 conversion to light olefins. Dr. Zhang is studying CNS encapsulated iron-cobalt catalysts and investigating their fundamental reaction mechanisms. These fundamental insights are being used to design new catalysts that perform much more efficiently. Dr. Zhang is actively engaged in training the next generation of undergraduates in chemistry education and research. Dr. Zhang?s lab involves diverse students from various majors in this interdisciplinary setting.

This project is significant in studying the composition, structure, and catalytic performances of CNS encapsulated metal/metal carbide catalysts by integrating synthesis, testing, and characterization of the catalysts with multiple compositional and structural variables. Specifically, the CNS encapsulated Fe catalyst provides an intriguing catalytic performance for CO2 conversion to light olefins. A variety of characterization instruments including in-situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD), ex-situ x-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are utilized to achieve a fundamental understanding of the reaction pathways and the confinement effect that contributes to the superior performance. Furthermore, with CNS serves as a nanocontainer, the encapsulated Fe-Co catalyst is expected to exhibit enhanced catalytic performances due to the synergistic effect of the bimetals, together with the unique confinement effect of CNS. By synthetically changing the relative shell thickness and core dimeter, a core-shell nano-environment of encapsulated active Fe/Co core species in the CNS shells provides an ideal and practical model system to explore the fundamentals of structural variables on the role of confinement in catalysis. This project has the dual impact of removing CO2 from the atmosphere while generating desired commercial products. Dr. Zhang incorporates undergraduate research and education as a very significant component.

At the molecular level however, the liquid is not uniform, but highly varied in how the molecules are arranged with respect to one another.  At most temperatures, molecules are in motion. At any given moment, some regions of the liquid might be denser, or more viscous than other regions.  This condition is called ?dynamic heterogeneity,? and it is an important consideration in discussing the mechanical properties of polymers, how proteins move through water, etc.  Dynamic heterogeneity is difficult to measure precisely - most measurements look at averages within a sample. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Laura Kaufman of Columbia University and her students are using an advanced molecular imaging technique that can track the motion of a single (molecule probe) through a liquid or polymer material.  The probe molecule is strongly fluorescent, meaning that when exposed to light of one wavelength, it emits light of another specific wavelength.  The emitted light allows the molecule to be tracked as it moves through different regions of the material.  The probe reveals dynamic heterogeneity as its motions are altered by changes in the structure of its environment. Professor Kaufman and her students are investigating dynamic heterogeneity in supercooled liquids (liquids colder than their freezing temperature but somehow still liquid), polymer nanocomposites (used in gas separations and electronic components), and ionic liquids. Most familiar ionic systems are solid, like table salt.  Ionic liquids are composed of positive and negative ions but are liquid at room temperature. Ionic liquids may have potential for ?green? industrial processes. The students engaged in this research are learning a broad range of experimental techniques and analysis approaches relevant to the specific project,  These approaches are also applicable to many areas of science and emerging technologies. In addition to providing training for graduate students, this project also includes outreach to K-8 students. The outreach events feature topics that provide an entry point to chemistry concepts such as phase diagrams and the concept of chemical stability.<br/><br/>Professor Kaufman and her students are refining and extending single molecule imaging approaches to detail aspects of dynamic heterogeneity in small molecule supercooled liquids and polymeric glass formers, with advances coming in the form of new probe molecules and new techniques to distinguish spatial and temporal heterogeneity. At the same time, the scope of this work is being extended to polymer nanocomposites and ionic liquids. Newly designed tethered probe molecules are prepared and used to complement free probe measurements and discriminate changes in dynamics that occur due to environmental rearrangement from those related to probe translocation.  The tethered probes provide a new approach to characterizing spatial extent of regions of distinct dynamics in these complex systems. The project also employs super-resolution experiments that allow simultaneous tracking of rotations and translations; this study seeks to resolve questions regarding the poorly understood phenomenon of rotational-translational decoupling, clarifying if it emerges from experimental biasing. The study of polymer nanocomposites focuses on the dynamics of the interfacial layer, and how interfacial layer properties vary with changes in the host matrix. Molecular probes are being developed to clarify how the interaction between structural and dynamic heterogeneity influences the properties of ionic liquids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research performed under this project will be used as a tool to initiate anannual program of Materials Chemistry behind Table Tennis at the East Syracuse Minoa High School. The research on the dopant location dependent properties of nanocrystals will be linked to the micro-composition-dependent performance of table tennis gear. By discussing the science behind sport, the program will be highly interactive and make materials chemistry more approachable to students. The educational plan improves the active learning process among middle and high school students, fosters interest in STEM education at their early ages, and develops science teaching skills for STEM undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Professor Zheng is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry to explore directional dopant migration behavior and systematically control dopant location and distribution inside host semiconductor nanocrystals. The goal of the project is to determine how the dopant spatial distribution is modified under the influence of local lattice composition and strain during surface shell passivation and functionalization in core/shell nanocrystals. The team is utilizing local nanocrystal lattices with relatively small cationic size mismatch relative to that of the dopants as an ""atomic trap"".  They initiate fast dopant migration inside nanocrystals under moderate temperatures. Controlled dopant migration for specific dopant locations inside core/shell NCs can fine tune the host-to-dopant coupling, which offers new opportunities to design novel nanomaterials with unprecedented properties for applications in dual-band optical sensors, white light emitters, and solar energy harvesters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Autschbach group is focusing specifically on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.  NMR spectroscopy is a cousin of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology used in medical diagnostics, and utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio-frequency light to reveal the structure of molecules.  In Raman spectroscopy, light (often of visible or ultraviolet wavelengths) is scattered off molecules, and slight changes in the wavelength of the scattered light can provide clues to the vibrational motions of molecules and their overall structure. With the help of sophisticated calculations and computer simulations, the outcome of experimental measurements of these molecular properties are predicted and analyzed. This research advances our understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and measured properties of molecules, as well as our general understanding of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation and matter. Theoretical methods and software developed during this investigation are made available to the larger community of scientists. In addition, this research project provides in-depth training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as opportunities for summer internships of high-school students. The student experience is enhanced by the collaborative nature of the project: While the research in the PI's laboratory is theoretical and computational in nature, it is carried out in the context of collaborations with experimental researchers from a variety of fields including materials science and catalysis. <br/><br/>The molecular properties in question are observed in spectroscopic or optical measurements and of high practical importance to learn about the structures and functions of molecules. The theoretical support provided by the PI is crucial in order to establish and refine the underlying structure-property relationships. Specifically, the properties of interest determine the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and the optical activity of molecules. The theoretical efforts of the project focus specifically on solid-state NMR parameters, NMR relaxation phenomena, and the structural and electronic origins of natural electronic and vibrational optical activity. In addition, the influence of the chemical and physical environment on these molecular properties is explored. NMR relaxation contains a wealth of information about the dynamics and characteristic correlation times of a chemical system. The PI studies the relaxation with ab-initio (from first principles) molecular dynamics simulations, which makes it possible to investigate systems containing elements from all across the periodic table. The optical activity-related part of the project focuses on resonance-effects in Raman vibrational optical activity, that is, when the Raman laser wavelength coincides with an electronic excitation wavelength, and on circularly polarized luminescence. Calculations of solid-state NMR parameters are undertaken to learn how they may reveal the unknown structures of chemical catalysts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2019 conference is held at Syracuse University on Saturday, March 23, 2019.  This conference presented an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career.  Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians.  Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research.  In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk.  In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students have the opportunity to learn about other research going on in the region, as well be exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar.  NSF funding increased access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources available to them an opportunity to take advantage of this conference.<br/> <br/>The ANYSRGMC is a one-day conference, the majority of which consists of 30 minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions.  There are two invited guest speakers, an opening address on Saturday morning and a Keynote address Saturday afternoon.  The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate students at Syracuse University and surrounding regions.  In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students have the opportunity to meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities.  Breaks between the talks gave graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations.

All galaxies appear to be surrounded by large halos of dark matter.  And dark matter dominates the gravitational field of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter is dark because it does not emit or absorb light making it hard to study.  In fact, astronomers do not yet know the true nature of dark matter.  But understanding this will advance our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.<br/><br/>By studying the dark matter halos of galaxies, and how their gravity bends light from more distant sources (gravity lenses), astronomers can learn about the structure of the dark matter in the halos how they were formed.  Various models to explain these things have been developed, and they can all be tested based on what actually happens in dark matter halos.  This proposed study will use high-resolution images of gravity lenses to learn more about the structure of the dark-matter halos.  The results will also help determine the type of particle dark matter is.<br/><br/>The PI's institution serves students from underrepresented and/or underprivileged backgrounds.  The Broader Impact part of this project will be to award promising undergraduate science and engineering majors (a minimum of six students over three years) a stipend to do research (allowing them to focus on studies and research rather than work part time jobs outside of school). The undergraduates will learn skills, and gain experiences, that are vital to STEM fields, while also producing valuable results for this project.  Each year, students accepted to the program will work at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) during the summer.  They will participate in a three-day workshop to acquire scientific computing skills, attend weekly meetings to discuss recent papers in astrophysics, and at the end of the summer will give a talk on their research at the AMNH ""Physical Sciences REU Symposium"". Finally, after the following fall semester the students will have the opportunity to attend and give a poster presentation of their research at the winter American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting.<br/><br/>This project clearly relates to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  In addition, the ""Broader Impact"" portion of the project does this, and advances the national health, prosperity and welfare by helping to develop interest in, and educating, STEM activities among the next generation of diverse individuals.<br/><br/><br/>The existence of small dark matter substructure in galaxies is a key prediction of dark matter theories that remains largely untested.  The project's goals are to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm by analyzing a sample of gravitational lenses observed at high resolution. The proposed project will evaluate methods to detect and characterize substructure in gravitational lens galaxies.  In particular it will consist of observing lenses in the submillimeter electromagnetic spectral range.  Galaxies with gravitational lenses are being discovered rapidly in this area.  Using high-resolution observations (e.g. by the ALMA telescope array) of these galaxies, the PI and team will obtain unprecedented information on the dark matter distribution in galaxies. And because gravitational lensing directly exhibits the warping of space time by dark matter, a study of gravitational lens systems is a promising method to constrain generic particle properties of dark matter (independent of specific particle models). The team's primary goal is to show how this information can be used to constrain the detailed properties of dark matter substructure as a way of identifying the nature of dark matter itself."

Scientists construct mathematical and computer models intended to capture the important features of a complex physical phenomenon, and learn more about the phenomenon by exploring what values of any uncertain model parameters lead to model predictions that mimic closely what is observed in nature.  Still, at best the models typically cannot capture all of nature's complexity ? or, as George Box famously put it, ""All models are wrong, but some are useful.""  This is really a good thing for discovery ? often scientists can get new insights and develop deeper understanding by studying precisely why their models fail to match reality.  In this research the PIs will develop a new approach to quantifying this ""discrepancy"" between mathematical models and observations, intended specifically for problems in which the data are numerical counts of events or objects.  Examples arise in nearly every scientific field ? counts of volcanoes or earthquakes or disease cases; of galaxies or stars or exoplanets; of photons or gamma ray burst pulses or neutrinos.  This project will specifically address two classes of problems in astronomy.  One class concerns how astronomers can convert raw data measuring light from astrophysical objects (such as stars and galaxies) into estimates of properties of the sources (such as brightness and color) with accurately quantified uncertainties, even when the precise shapes of the objects are not known, and their images overlap.  A second class concerns using astronomical survey catalogs to learn the dominant demographic properties of stars, galaxies, or minor planets (such as asteroids), such as the distribution of their luminosities or masses. The NSF-funded Vera Rubin Observatory will produce data for both types of problems. The research will include developing fast, open-source<br/>computational algorithms implementing the new approaches.<br/><br/>The project is motivated by application areas in which salient feature discovery is threatened by model misspecification.  In applications with real-valued magnitude data with additive Gaussian errors, statisticians have addressed misspecification by introducing additive discrepancy processes into models, often using Gaussian processes.  The two problem areas addressed here require analysis of discrete count or point process data: photon counting data comprising images and time series from cosmic sources, or demographic data in astronomical survey catalogs.  Both areas rely on Poisson point process models, with an intensity function describing, say, the photon arrival rate (per unit area) as a function of direction and time, or the density of galaxies as a function of spatial location and luminosity.  Additive discrepancy models are not applicable to such discrete-data settings.  The team will develop new semiparametric methods that supplement parametric salient feature models with nonparametric discrepancy processes that flexibly model the departure of salient models from the true data generating process.  An approach serving as a starting point represents the true underlying intensity function as the product of the salient feature model and a stochastic multiplicative discrepancy process.  The salient feature model will be a parametricintensity function (e.g., with location, amplitude, scale, and shape parameters), sometimes in a superposition of multiple components (e.g., stars in an image, pulses in a transient burst, or population components). To model discrepancy from the salient model, a natural choice with appealing theoretical properties is a multiplicative gamma discrepancy process; composition with the Poisson point process leads to an overall negative binomial point process for the observations.  The team will implement this approach, and generalize it in several directions. For demographic models, the discrepancy models will be embedded in a hierarchical model that accounts for measurement error and selection effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some polymers can be flexible and soft. Other polymers can be long and stiff. By combining stiff and flexible polymers in a single system formed on a surface, we have learned that we can make nanoscale spiky brush-like surfaces using careful temperature control and coating methods. The PI and his group plan to better understand this surface formation process by making new combinations of soft and stiff polymers, by using advanced tools to study their organization, and by employing computers to model the structure and to predict their behavior. This new way of making surfaces opens up many interesting applications. For example, the surface mimics the protein spikes present on virus surfaces that are used by nature to identify target cells, take part in the entry into the cell, and also to prevent identification by antibodies. These materials can be used to study the behavior of cells on topics ranging from how they work to the behavior of the immune system. Because the spikes are vertically aligned, they may also act as nanowires, so they can be used in energy production and storage systems like solar cells and batteries. Finally, these spikes may be piezoelectric, i.e. they could convert electrical energy to motion (or sound) and motion to electrical energy. This research program will also serve as a mechanism to teach students about polymers and materials science, create globally aware graduate students, and expose students to a collaborative environment. Graduate students will be able to work with the research groups of our collaborators as parts of teams and to take part in exchange visits. Lessons learned from these research programs will be used to teach K-12 students and to be applied in high school teachers' workshops. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Coil polymer brushes synthesized using living radical polymerization methods will be combined with rod brushes with high persistence lengths grown from surfaces made using a variety of living and pseudo-living chemistries. Phase separation aided by solvent processing and guided by nanolithography will be used to control in-plane structure. A variety of chemical and process methods will be used to limit macroscopic phase separation and thereby direct assembly of topographical and chemical structures. Brush growth will employ new, chemically tailored brush initiators for single chain and binary chain growth to form rod-coil mixed brush pairings. To direct brush structure and rod-coil phase separation, brush initiators will be patterned at length scales of a few 10s of nanometers using state-of-the-art lithography methods to control spacing of the brush spikes. Brush organization will be compared to computational predictions which will be used to guide both brush design and selection and to anticipate the resulting physical structure and aid characterization studies. Characterization of the brushes will be made using a selection of analytical methods including grazing incidence (GI) SAXS and WAXS, neutron reflectivity and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements. Studies of the conductivity and piezoelectric character of the rod-coil brush films will aid in our understanding of the mixed brush structure. Through collaborations, studies of these materials as cell membrane substrates, for targeted biomolecular binding, as piezoelectric and as conducting materials with unusual transport pathways, will also provide information about key length scales and rod-brush organization. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference, first held in 1994, will continue to serve students and faculty from a diverse list of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the Northeast. The goals of the conference are to motivate undergraduate students, in particular underrepresented groups and women, at all levels to attend and participate in a professional conference of the mathematical sciences; to provide students with an opportunity to learn about the community of mathematical scientists by interacting and networking with peers and faculty; and to provide a venue where undergraduates, share their scholarship, and practice communicating through preparing and presenting talks. This conference is distinctive because it explicitly aims to involve first-year and sophomore students as participants and because it is free to attendees. It is thus able to nourish the mathematical growth and collaborative experience of students and faculty at institutions that do not have the funds for conference expenses. The conferences will include two panels: one on how to make the most of one's college career and the other on career choices both in and out of academia. The atmosphere of the conference is exciting and encouraging and conference surveys have shown again and again that the experience of attending and/or presenting at the conference is key to retaining and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences. The problem-solving, reasoning, and communication skills developed at these conferences are transferable and will prepare students to solve larger societal issues. <br/><br/>These three one-day conferences will each bring together 300-350 students and faculty from the mathematical sciences. Students, under the mentorship of faculty members, will give most (approximately 80%) of the 15 minute presentations which are organized into three 1- hour session times each with multiple parallel sessions organized by subject. All conference participants will come together for an hour long keynote speech given by a well-known mathematical scientist followed by a working lunch and two informative lunchtime panels. The conference organizers have an assessment plan to modify the conference's evaluation tool and to centralize storage and access of conference data and an outreach plan to increase participation by members of underrepresented groups and to include first and second year students, as well as high school students and their teachers.  Through the preparation and presentation of talks, students learn to take complex mathematical ideas and present them in clear, understandable terms.

We only know about dark matter by its gravitational attraction to the normal matter that we see. <br/><br/>The investigators seek to discover where that dark matter is in our own Milky Way galaxy.  If investigators can find spots were the stars in the Milky Way are jostled in predicted ways, they will learn how dark matter interacts with regular matter.  To find the location of dark matter, the investigators will study the motions of stars from smaller galaxies that are falling into the Milky Way, and the motions in the Milky Way disk, which is the part of our galaxy that includes the spiral arms.  These stars will be pulled towards the dark matter, which will make it possible for identify the dark matter location and concentration.<br/><br/>In addition to providing researchers with constraints on dark matter in the Universe, the investigators will directly contribute to education at all levels.  Graduate and undergraduate students will learn how to conduct research.

By colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored.  Currently the most successful theory for explaining how these elementary particles interact at the highest possible energies is string theory.   String theory has the advantage of not only explaining the existence of all of the elementary particles as different excitations of a fundamental string, but also explaining how gravity might be unified with the other, non-gravitational forces. In his research, Professor Anchordoqui aims to develop methods to search for and test some of the ideas coming from string theory at the LHC.    As a consequence, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Anchordoqui will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and develop new course curricula based on results from the LHC.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Anchordoqui will consider extensions of the Standard Model based on open strings ending on D-branes, with gauge bosons emerging as strings attached to stacks of D-branes and with chiral matter emerging as strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. Assuming that the fundamental string mass scale is in the TeV range and the theory is weakly coupled, Professor Anchordoqui will develop a number of search strategies that would signal string physics at the LHC. These include a re-examination of the so-called ""Green-Schwarz mechanism"", a modification of an action functional of a quantum field theory involving higher gauge fields that makes a quantum anomaly of the original action functional disappear, as well as the study of the minimal left-right symmetric intersecting D-brane model.  He also plans to investigate whether the (possible) discrepancy between observation and theoretical calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be explained in the context of low-mass-scale string resonances.    Professor Anchordoqui will also undertake a phenomenological analysis of inflationary potentials exhibiting S-duality.    Professor Anchordoqui is also involved with the Pierre Auger Collaboration, searching for the origin and nature of the highest-energy cosmic rays and studying particle interactions at center-of-mass energies well beyond those attained at the LHC."

This model has succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date has been recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.<br/><br/>The work proposed here is to develop the front-end electronics for a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the Liquid Argon, Near Detector (LAr1-ND) Experiment. This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations. At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. The electronics developed through this award will also advance an important new technology for the field, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, which is the likely technology in the future large-scale Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) being constructed at FNAL."

Today, extremely sensitive instruments operate in the high energy (AGILE and FERMI in the range 100 MegaelectronVolt (MeV) - 100 GigaelectronVolt (GeV)) and very high energy (VHE) (HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS at energies greater than 100 GeV;) regimes simultaneously. Among the most exciting results from VERITAS are the detection of emission from the Crab Pulsar above 100 GeV (requiring the presence of a new emission component), the discovery of gamma-ray emission from a starburst galaxy, M82 (firmly associating cosmic-ray acceleration with star-forming regions), and the detection of correlated variability in the radio and Teraelectronvolt (TeV) regimes in radio galaxies (helping to constrain the emission to be originating within the jet collimation region). The upper limit on the gamma-ray emission from the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy set by VERITAS rules out most of the leptophilic dark matter parameter space favored by recent cosmic-ray positron measurements. A major upgrade to the VERITAS cameras during summer 2012 introduced high-quantum-efficiency photo multiplier tubes to lower the energy threshold of the array by 30%, and the array will be further augmented by the arrival in 2015 of a prototype 10 meter class Schwarzschild-Couder telescope under development for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). <br/><br/>Following the recent VERITAS hardware upgrade, great promise for further improving the science potential of the instrument comes from a focus on data analysis. This CAREER award provides support for developing major improvements in VERITAS data analysis methods aimed at lowering the analysis threshold, improving angular and energy resolution, and increasing background discrimination. It will also support analysis of VERITAS data to search for dark matter signals from the Galactic Halo, Fermi unassociated sources, and related targets, as well as studies of Galactic accelerators of cosmic rays. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The science of VERITAS and CTA - searching for dark matter and investigating the most powerful cosmic accelerators - has broad applications to both astro- and particle physics, and addresses questions that can capture the public's imagination. Group members will share that excitement via public lectures at area high schools and to groups in the local Morningside Heights and Harlem areas of Manhattan and Westchester County, and by engaging undergraduates and area high school students in the group's research activities.

As more data are acquired, these functions inevitably become more complex. Oftentimes the most fundamental challenge for these applications is how to quantify the complexity of such tasks and learn these functions from data in an efficient way, both statistically and computationally. Despite impressive progress made in recent years, the current approach towards this goal is limited by the discrete nature of the classical notion of computational complexity and is not suitable for statistical problems that are continuous. This project aims to develop an information-based approach that better accounts for both statistical and computational efficiencies. This new framework of complexity is expected to offer insights into the potential trade-off between statistical and computational efficiencies and to reveal the role of experimental design in alleviating computational burden. The project provides training for graduate students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>Traditional nonparametric techniques based solely on smoothness are known to suffer from the so-called ""curse of dimensionality."" But in many scientific and engineering applications, the underlying high-dimensional object may have additional structures which, if appropriately accounted for, could help lift this barrier and allow for efficient methods to handle it. This project aims to develop a coherent framework to quantify the complexity of high dimensional models that appropriately accounts for both statistical accuracy and computational cost and helps better understand the role of these additional structures. The project will use this notion of complexity to examine several common yet notoriously difficult high-dimensional nonparametric regression problems: one based solely on smoothness, another based on smoothness and sparsity, and finally, one based on low-rank tensors. The exercise is designed to reveal interesting relationships between statistical and computational aspects of these problems and lead to the development of novel and optimal sampling and estimation strategies. The research will develop the new framework of complexity in more general statistical contexts as well and investigate its role in characterizing statistically and computationally optimal inference schemes. This will be achieved by developing new statistical methods and computational algorithms, theoretical study of their performance and fundamental limits, and the development of related mathematical tools and computational software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, minor compositional modifications that occur locally in a material can lead to drastic changes in properties such as corrosion resistance, catalytic function, fracture strength, and interfacial adhesion. This project seeks to uncover the dependence of surface segregation on controllable parameters such as bulk composition, surface orientation and morphology, and external stimuli as well as the microscopic mechanism of the surface segregation process. The fundamental insight will have considerable practical importance for a wide range of material systems, properties, and reactions because segregation not only modifies surface chemistry and composition but also the atomic structure and strain state in the surface and subsurface regions in multicomponent materials. The fundamental knowledge of the prototypes of basic processes controlling surface composition and structure evolution will open up new perspectives of designing alloys with desired surface properties by manipulating bulk properties of the alloy and their interplay with the surroundings. As part of this research program, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will learn about new microscopy, spectroscopy and computational techniques as well as work on materials issues that are at the forefront of current materials research. The training of students in the broader area of materials science will result in future leaders that are better equipped to solve the complex energy and environmental problems that face society.

A microscopic understanding of many physical and chemical processes taking place at the surface of multicomponent materials requires as a prerequisite atomic-scale understanding of surface segregation induced compositional and structural evolution. Despite this importance, the atomic processes governing the onset, promotion, and termination of surface segregation under practical conditions are largely unknown. This project employs atomistically informed approaches toward a mechanistic understanding of surface segregation phenomena by gaining transformational knowledge of surface compositional and structural dynamics of alloys. The research is based on a combined atomistic experimental and computational program with tightly integrated feedback loops, including quantitative in-situ metrology that uses complementary forefront techniques for dynamically measuring surface composition, structure and chemistry of the alloys under realistic environment conditions and closely coordinated atomistic modeling ranging from first-principles calculations to large-scale molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The comprehensive understanding will shed light on many multicomponent systems due to a shared set of prototypical basic processes governing surface segregation, including thermodynamic driving forces, interplay between chemical ordering and elemental segregation, and kinetic obstacles of atomic exchanges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The LHC has recently begun its second extended data-taking period (Run II), and it is hard to envisage a more exciting time in particle physics. Run II will test whether the recently discovered Higgs boson is fully consistent with our current expectations, or whether it behaves in ways that transcend our best current theories.  Another primary aim of the LHC program is to seek a microscopic theory of Dark Matter, which is currently poorly understood, and to understand whether there exist any interactions of Dark Matter with more traditional kinds of matter. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. All of these analyses require precise theoretical predictions in order to extract useful information from the data, and Professor Williams will carry out detailed analyses along these lines. Specifically, Professor Williams will perform new calculations using recently developed methods which will result in a much smaller theoretical uncertainty than those which have previously been used. The results of his calculations will be released publicly to both experimental and theoretical users and will be utilized in experimental analyses. Professor Williams will also establish an educational outreach program, targeting a minority population (Native Americans) which are one of the most under-represented in the sciences.   By working directly with SuperIntendents from the local Native-American school districts, Professor Williams will, over the lifetime of the award, arrange after-school programs and as well as field trips to the Fermilab National Accelerator laboratory. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Williams will perform cutting-edge calculations at Next-to-Next-to Leading Order accuracy and beyond, and implement these results into a publicly available computer code, MCFM.

An educational component will create training programs and extra-curricular opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research and learn valuable statistical and technical skills.  Many of the students are expected to be from low-income and underrepresented groups, thus broadening the participation of these groups in STEM industry and research.<br/><br/>This research will develop methods for analyzing tree data that use both the tree shape and the length of its edges in a mathematically integrated way. The majority of existing tree analysis methods only focus on the tree shape, but the proposed methods will be based on the underlying non-Euclidean geometric space in which the data lie. This research will contribute to the growing field of geometric statistics with a mathematical formulation and method of computation for bias in tree-shaped data, and two-sample tests validated on biologically realistic data. In scaling these statistical methods to meet the Big Data challenge, this research will continue to expand the field of computational geometry to piece-wise Euclidean, non-positively curved spaces. Finally, this research will lead to characterizing the first continuous geometric spaces for phylogenetic networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cornell University, in partnership with Clark Atlanta University, Johns Hopkins University, and Princeton University form the Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM).  PARADIM seeks to advance fundamental understanding of oxide-based hetero-interfaces with a range of two-dimensional (2D) material systems including oxides, chalcogenides and graphene through transformational research and mid-scale investments in instrumentation for bulk and thin film crystal growth and characterization.  Fabricating interfaces and heterostructures between complex oxides and 2D materials allows for the creation of an atomically-precise ""active substrate"" that can itself have novel electronic and magnetic functionality, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, or superconductivity.  Creating interface materials with designed properties opens up untold degrees of freedom that may result in transformational evolutions in next generation electronics.<br/><br/>PARADIM's in-house research team will focus on developing hetero-interfaces that exhibit broken valley symmetry at interfaces between 2D materials and active substrates with novel electronic and magnetic functionality.  External researchers from across the U.S. also working to advance the next generation of electronic devices; specifically those researching valleytronics, spintronics, and multiferroics; will also have access to the Platform's growth capabilities and the expertise in synthesis, characterization, and theoretical modeling.  Along with access to mid-scale level tools and expertise, a unique feature of the Platform is the access to new oxide bulk single crystal samples and epitaxial thin film heterostructures produced and curated by PARADIM.  Signature mid-scale instruments of the Platform include a suite of specialty bulk single crystal growth instruments with in-situ characterization tools capable of growing manganites, ferrites, cobaltates, nickelates, ruthenates, iridates and other compelling oxide systems.  An MBE tool with unique in-situ diagnostic capabilities and a tandem MOCVD instrument for depositing non-oxide systems such as chalcogenides is also available.  The combination of instruments allows for the growth of a wide variety of inorganic systems, yielding crystals for fundamental studies, novel heterostructures exhibiting novel properties, and bulk substrates on which to grow unexplored thin film phases and structures.  In addition, the Platform makes available an impressive range of TEMs capable of high-throughput structural and chemical analysis as well as magnetic imaging and low-temperature spectroscopic mapping.  The research of external users and those of the PARADIM in-house team together create a community of researchers poised to make transformational gains in the accelerated discovery and deployment of new electronic materials, specifically enabling new oxide bulk single crystals and novel heterostructures.<br/><br/>Along with an annual REU program, PARADIM will offer hands-on research experiences for local undergraduates year-round in the crystal growth facilities.  In addition, educational materials will be available to users of PARADIM in the form of on-line short courses as well as a Materials-by-Design Toolbox that provides open-source software and databases to users on-line.  A signature outreach program will be the annual PARADIM Summer Schools, where graduate students, post-docs, young faculty, and industrial scientists are immersed in a seminar and hands-on workshop environment to learn techniques in bulk and thin film crystal growth, theory, and characterization.  Workshops will also be held that are industry focused.<br/><br/>http://www.paradim.cornell.edu <br/><br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/>The Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM) will help users design and create new interface materials - materials that do not exist in nature - with unprecedented properties for the next generation of electronic devices.  Creating new interface materials with unprecedented properties, by design rather than by serendipity, is accomplished in PARADIM through a synergistic set of user facilities dedicated to theory (figuring out where to put the atoms for useful behavior), synthesis (putting the atoms in the targeted positions), and characterization (seeing that the atoms are indeed in the desired positions).  Each of these world-class user facilities is equipped with the latest tools, techniques, and expertise to realize this materials-by-design dream.  Users from throughout the nation will use PARADIM to discover and create interface materials for the next generation of electronics and optoelectronics.  These new materials will enable novel ways for electrons to carry information in solid-state devices and efficiently interact with magnetic, electrical, and optical stimuli.  To balance the desire for a rich nation-wide user group and the practicality of managing physical resources across different locations, PARADIM locates its web-based theory user facility at Clark Atlanta University, its bulk crystal growth user facility at Johns Hopkins University, and its thin film growth and characterization user facilities at Cornell University.  Researchers from Princeton University will participate in the in-house research activity.  PARADIM's user facilities leverage existing user facilities including the Cornell NanoScale Facility, the Cornell Center for Materials Research, and the Johns Hopkins Materials Characterization and Processing Facility. <br/><br/>In addition to training materials innovators to work effectively in teams, PARADIM will conduct free summer schools involving hands-on use of PARADIM facilities to help educate PARADIM's ""community of practitioners"" and advance the field through the cross-fertilization of ideas.  PARADIM will also serve as a focal point for training the next generation of technologists - people who are accustomed to designing and creating new interface materials with atomic precision and have the skills necessary to capitalize on useful new interface material ideas and make them a reality.  This platform marks the beginning of a new PARADIM in materials discovery.<br/><br/>http://www.paradim.cornell.edu"

Powerful computational and experimental tools will be employed to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-traceable protein fibers capable of delivering drugs. The resulting biomaterials will have broad societal impact in the field of drug delivery and tissue engineering. Lessons learned from these studies can be employed for delivery of other chemical agents with applications extending to non-medical industries including personal care, cosmetics and environmental remediation. This research will train the next generation of scientists and engineers to employ cutting edge technologies in computational biology, protein engineering and materials science to create, rapidly screen and characterize new functional biomaterials. The project will also engage girls (predominantly women of color) from the Urban Assembly Institute for Math and Science for Young Women who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM on biomaterials in alignment with the Next Generation Science Standards. In collaboration with the start-ups, InSchoolApps, and the MakerSpace, the girls will participate in biomaterials chemistry, computer programming, rendering of proteins in three dimensions and visualization.<br/><br/>Technical description: The fabrication of multifunctional materials that can self-assemble into defined structures bears tremendous potential for a number of application including drug delivery and tissue engineering. One challenge is to deliver an appropriate chemical agent and non-invasively monitor the surrounding area amidst a complex biological milieu or extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is comprised of protein fibers (from the nano to microscale) organized into a mesoscopic three-dimensional network. The development of a material capable of targeted therapy and diagnosis or ""theranosis"" would enable one to simultaneously interface with specific cells while providing both detailed functional and molecular information through visualization. We intend to drive design of protein fibers through computation and assess through experimental analysis, their physicochemical properties with the objective to predictably: 1) control self-assembly into fibers on the mesoscale with functional capabilities of small molecule recognition; 2) integrate non-canonical amino acids that encode thermostability and traceability using our developed algorithms for fluorinated amino acids, beyond the limits of biological diversity; and 3) biomineralize and order iron oxide nanoparticles on the organized protein fiber substrates leading to image-ready bio-nanocomposites with magnetic properties. The intellectual merit of this proposal relies on developing a new paradigm for coiled-coil protein materials design that cycles between computation and experimentation. This will enable the rapid iteration for controlling fiber assembly and the identification of rules for coiled-coil fiber and nanocomposite design. In addition to employing state-of-the-art open source programs, we will also use synthetic biology to produce the proteins enabling synthesis for high-throughput screening. This work is well aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative, as we will apply the computational tools already built for protein design with the aim of fabricating novel biomaterials, in this case fibers and inorganic-organic hybrid composites. The versatility of the proposed materials will not only prove useful for applications in biomedicine, but also will lead to fundamental insight into computational methods for modeling and designing protein fibers and nanocomposites."

Topology is the study of spatial structures (e.g. the surface of a donut, the large-scale shape of the cosmos, a tangled strand of DNA, a cluster of points in a massive data set), while algebraic geometry studies the mathematics of the ubiquitous polynomial equation. These disciplines have many and diverse points of contact; the principal investigator will study one in particular: families of Riemann surfaces. A surface is a topological object like the two-dimensional surface of a coffee cup, possibly one with lots of extra handles. A Riemann surface gives a special way of describing such an object as the solution to a polynomial equation, much as we learn in high school algebra that some equations describe circles, others ellipses, and others far more complicated shapes. A family of Riemann surfaces arises by varying the equations used to define the Riemann surface - one can imagine ""turning a knob"" to stretch and distort the shapes of the surfaces. Families of Riemann surfaces arise in many parts of mathematics and also play an important role in theoretical physics. The principal investigator will apply tools from topology and the related discipline of geometric group theory in order to better understand some of the most important families of Riemann surfaces that mathematicians today are interested in. Broader impacts include the establishment of a new chapter of the national Directed Reading Project network.<br/><br/>The project has two components. The first will investigate the topology of strata of Abelian differentials (translation surfaces). These families have been intensively studied by dynamicists and geometers, but there are foundational topological questions that still remain. In particular, the (orbifold) fundamental groups of strata are still highly mysterious. This can be effectively probed by way of the monodromy representation, a map into the mapping class group. The principal investigator will continue his work describing these monodromy representations, and will develop new tools to understand the monodromy kernel and so further develop the theory of fundamental groups of strata. Central to this endeavor will be an elucidation of the precise relationship between Artin groups and fundamental groups of strata. The second component of this project concerns families constructed via branched covers. These families have served as an important source of examples in topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. The principal investigator will investigate the monodromy of these families with the objective of further synthesizing the topological aspects (braid groups, mapping class groups) with the algebraic (arithmetic groups and generalizations, Burau-like representations, primitive homology).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This first quantum revolution enabled the amazing technological developments of the 20th century, resulting e.g. in modern electronics and immense societal impact. Today the world is witnessing the early days of the second quantum revolution, where the convergent elements of quantum mechanics like quantum superposition or quantum entanglement will lead to widespread practical applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography or quantum sensing. One of the major obstacles in achieving this goal is lack of specialized workforce. The required qualifications comprise deep understanding of quantum mechanics, but also include practical knowledge of the convergent fields of microwave electronics, cryogenic and ultra-high vacuum technologies, quantum materials, advanced computer programming and algorithm optimization, with elements of device and system engineering. Existing educational programs usually specialize in only one or two of the above areas. This project helps fill the void in educating the future cadre for quantum revolution by putting together a transdisciplinary group of practitioners experienced in various aspects of quantum science with a group of select graduate students from across the US in the form of an annually recurring Summer School. The cultural and intellectual challenge comes from a need to equip students with practical knowledge of multiple fields relevant to quantum revolution, but also from the desire to foster their ability to learn and maintain the curiosity needed for future progress. The interactions of students with leaders in the field are based on a mixture of direct presentations, tutorials and talks, with interactive activities including round table discussions, student presentations, and courses in practical use of quantum technology. Interactions between speakers from various disciplines, from condensed matter physics through quantum chemistry and engineering, are expected to generate new ideas at the boundaries of fields.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>As the first quantum revolution of the 1920s led to the modern digital and telecommunications age of the present day, the current position of quantum science suggests that a second quantum revolution is at hand which is expected to have wide reaching implications not only for our fundamental understanding of the natural world but also for computing, energy, and global connectivity.  A critical component of this development is the education of the next generation of scientists in the principles, methods, and goals of this ""Quantum Leap"".  This is motivated by the observation that the rapidly growing quantum industry is facing an acute shortage of uniquely qualified workforce. New approaches to education in quantum science are particularly important given the breadth of disciplines brought together in this area- reaching across mathematics, chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering.  As part of initiating this educational effort, this project puts forth a summer school for graduate students as a direct tool to provide an in-depth immersion in the emerging field of convergent quantum science and technology.  The approach of this gathering is a summer school wherein students are exposed to education in science and technology beyond what they could be exposed to in traditional classroom settings or typical conferences/workshops.  Lecturers focus on pedagogical lectures on these topics rather than seminar style research presentations.  Afternoon sessions are aimed at interactive activities involving students and presenters.  Themed panels with speakers and organizers serving as panel members for both scientific and career related sessions are planned. The lecturers are encouraged to participate in several days rather than one or two days, to include the additional benefit of cross-disciplinary ""pollination"" of ideas between lecturers from different disciplines. The program combines aspects of classroom style education, research seminars, multitude of interactive forms and an active discussion forum.  The two week duration for the school encourages both formal and informal discussion between students and lecturers as well as among the students themselves."

In recent years, a number of promising early-career topologists have started tenure-track positions in these departments. This, coupled with the phenomenal recent growth in applications of topology, creates the potential for bringing many new researchers into topological fields and producing significant ground-breaking work. With this award, the principle investigators seek to foster the development of newcomers to topology and increase the level of interaction among all researchers in topology in upstate New York by creating an annual series of weekend conferences. These conferences will highlight work done by New York topologists, and will also provide New York topologists with the opportunity to interact with each other and with established and emerging leaders in the field.<br/><br/>The conference will feature eight 45-minute plenary lectures accessible to an audience of algebraic, applied, and geometric topologists. The speakers are chosen so that participants will have the opportunity to learn about recent work in a wide range of fields within topology.

Depending upon on the chemical structure of the monomer, the polymer can either be slippery (like Teflon) or sticky (like tape).  By changing the monomer, one can create surfaces that prevent adhesion of cells, making them better for medical uses. Nature accomplishes this by attaching charged polymer segments to surfaces, forming structures that resemble brushes. While these brush polymers offer unique properties that could have substantive societal impacts, they also pose significant challenges. The dense packing of the charged groups can stretch the chemical bonds and, in extreme cases, the bonds can break. With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Ober at Cornell University is creating and studying new polymer brushes that are effective coatings but also have long lifetimes (i.e., do not have bonds that easily break). Collaborators, Professor Ryan (University of Sheffield) and Professor Ruehe (University of Freiburg), are helping to characterize the polymer structures. In addition to its scientific impact, the project benefits society by educating undergraduate and graduate students to become globally aware, interdisciplinary scientists. Surface-bound bottlebrush polymers are potentially synthetic mimics for shock absorbing components in the human body, thus, the broader scientific impact of this project outside of macromolecular chemistry is potentially quite large.  Insights into the polyelectrolyte brush behavior may also help in the understanding the attachment of biomolecules, cells and microorganisms to surfaces and thus be used to control into unwanted adhesions on ships for the marine industry.<br/><br/>The research team is creating and studying a series of stable model polymer brushes with carefully tailored placement of ionic groups in both single strand and bottlebrush architectures. Physical phenomena associated with charge, binding and attachment of soluble species, and the rather unusual case of mechanochemistry that leads to brush breakage are being investigated. Professor Ober and his collaborators are preparing specially tailored polyelectrolyte brushes with selected vertical and horizontal brush architectures and studying their physical properties. Ionic groups are attached directly to the acrylate or methacrylate polymer backbone or through tailored sequences of peptoid units of precise ionic group spacing and location. Confinement is controlled by the use of nanopatterning in which the pattern sizes are comparable to brush height (tens of nanometers). The effect of cation charge is studied using a range of mono- and multivalent cations.  Characterization activities include: X-ray scattering studies of brush swelling and shrinkage under a range of wetting and electrolyte conditions and neutron reflectivity studies using labeled polymer chains to separately gather information about the different components (backbone, sidearm, ions) to develop a detailed picture of the charged polymer brush.  Graduate students serve as mentors and role models to undergraduate students, while at the same time gaining supervisory skills. Undergraduates from Cornell University take part during the academic year while REU students from other schools with an emphasis on<br/>underrepresented students participate in research during the summer months. Lessons learned from these research programs are integrated into lessons for high school teachers in a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program and in teachers' workshops."

Crucial for the use of hSC in medicine is control over inter-cell communication, since those pathways are the ones responsible for making patterns and integrating the fate of a cell with its environment. In  this project the PI will develop quantitative models of how spatial patterns arise and evolve in populations of stem cells. The predictions of these models will be tested experimentally. The understanding of the spatial patterns formed by stem cells will be used to understand cell-cell communication and how cells interact with their environment that is very important in biology, medicine, and bioengineering.<br/><br/>Recently an assay was developed for differentiating hSC on micropatterned surfaces, that generates the precursors to ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm, etc. tissues in a spatial arrangement that recapitulates the embryo. This assay permits easy time lapse imaging of stem colonies while the cells signal to each other, move, and acquire distinct patterns of gene expression. Cells can be engineered to produce specific signals on demand and then mixed with naive cells and the emergent patterns followed over time. The relevant signals are generally present at too low a level to be observed directly, so a complex modeling procedure is needed to infer them from the response of the receiving cells. Critical for the success of any modeling in this area are succinct representations for the activity of the hundreds of genes that pattern an embryo. Modern mathematics provides the template for such models, and a separate project will test their application to the development of an organ in the nematode C.elegans. Through a collaboration, this project has access to many hSC lines with fluorescent tags on the genes that mediate cell signaling, and Physicists learn how to derive such lines themselves. Image processing systems developed in house are integrated with experiments to ask whether quantitative and predictive models formulated with only a few variables and guided by geometry are feasible. The goal is an algorithm to select among the infinite combinations of signaling molecules, their concentrations, and the time and duration of their application, the most efficient way to derive any desired cell or tissue from pluripotent cells."

Revived in the beginning of the twentieth century to deal with some foundational issues, mathematical logic turned out to also be useful for obtaining new results in mathematics. The recent applications of the model theory of difference and differential algebra to algebraic number theory are some of the most exciting examples of this. Difference equations, like differential equations, model real-world processes that change over time. Differential equations describe quantities that vary continuously with time, such as the positions of planets in space, while difference equations describe quantities that are only measured at discrete time intervals, such as the annual GDP of a country. Difference algebra is the abstract setting for studying difference equations; it also has applications to the kind of algebraic number theory that underpins modern cryptography and internet security.  Medvedev proposes to study the fine structure of solution sets of difference equations: to find algorithms for computing their dimensions and for identifying the very special cases where it is possible to define some kind of addition and/or multiplication on these sets.<br/><br/>A difference field is a field with a distinguished automorphism. The theory of difference closed fields is supersimple, meaning that Lascar rank is a good notion of dimension for complete types. Furthermore, the complete types of Lascar rank 1 satisfy the Zilber Trichotomy: each is nonorthogonal to a definable field, or nonorthogonal to a definable one-based group, or is disintegrated. While the fieldlike case of the trichotomy is relatively easy to identify in explicit examples, the dividing line between the grouplike and the disintegrated cases is much less clear. Similarly, even in the relatively nice case of groups, it is not always easy to determine the Lascar rank of a particular type. Beginning with her PhD thesis, Medvedev has worked on these sorts of problems, and on applications to algebraic dynamics. She is confident that she can generalize the main theorem of her PhD thesis from curves to higher-dimensional algebraic varieties. She has already accomplished the first part of this in far greater generality; the last part of the original proof should generalize easily; and the middle piece is supplied by an observation in a paper by Chatzidakis and Hrushovski. She expects to also obtain concrete results on the Lascar rank of certain groups G defined by systems of polynomial difference equations. This question can be translated to the language of linear algebra over the quasiendomorphism ring of the underlying algebraic group. For example, when G is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field in characteristic zero, this question reduces to linear algebra over the field of rational numbers. In addition, Medvedev proposes to continue expanding her foundational notes about difference schemes defined by Hrushovski in his work on the model theory of Frobenius automorphisms, filling in many missing detail, adding enlightening examples, and reorganizing the presentation to make it (more) understandable. Medvedev expects to continue involving students in this work, encouraging logicians and algebraic geometers to learn each other's languages when they are still young."

Around one third of the speakers are chosen to represent the area of emphasis and among these two are chosen to give introductory talks about the area, in order that regular attendees might learn about the area in greater depth than they might only from research presentations.  Recent areas of emphasis were ""Groups Acting on Hyperbolic Spaces"" (2015), ""Topological Combinatorics"" (2016), and ""Topology and Physics"" (2017). The area of emphasis for the 54th Cornell Topology Festival is ""Representation Theory and Topology"".  More details about the upcoming and previous festivals can be found at the website:<br/><br/>http://www.math.cornell.edu/~festival/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The societal impact of understanding template-guided genome rearrangement is potentially enormous, both as a natural phenomenon that, when mis-guided, can lead to disease, and that if harnessed could lead to the next generation of tools for genome editing. This project seeks to learn from both theory and experiments how a mechanism for RNA-templated DNA recombination sculpts the assembly of genetic information in certain species of ciliates, the organisms with the greatest levels of natural genome editing. Through use of high-throughput experimental tools and novel mathematical concepts based on knot theory and discrete mathematics, the project will gain temporal and structural insight into the process of programmed genome reorganization, including genome-wide surveys of DNA-- DNA and DNA--RNA contacts during somatic development in ciliates. The proposed research will impact postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate education in mathematics, biology, and chemistry, with at least two postdocs, three PhDs and several senior theses expected to result from this project. <br/><br/>Because the ciliate Oxytricha undergoes hundreds of thousands of programmed DNA rearrangements during development, more than any other known organism, we use Oxytricha and its close relatives as a tractable lab model to study template-guided genome rearrangements. This project increases our understanding of template-guided chromosomal DNA rearrangements, both during the process of nuclear development and across the evolutionary steps that gave rise to scrambled genomes. Previous studies have shown that the general mechanism that orchestrates this rearrangement process is guided by maternal RNA templates that can be mathematically modeled by spatial graphs, while the rearrangement pathways can be modeled as paths in a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are the spatial graphs. The project approaches the problem through the lens of the intermediate molecules, as well as the higher level interactions that arise during rearrangement, and it will examine both experimentally and theoretically the global rearrangement pathways. Specific aims include: 1. Experimental dissection of the temporal order of events and the formation of DNA-- DNA and DNA--RNA interactions during genome rearrangement. 2. Build mathematical methods for genome rearrangements using graph based descriptions of the changes in the intermediates. 3. Develop mathematical models to measure differences in underlying scrambling patterns, as well as differences in possible rearrangement pathways between different species. 4. Initiate mathematical techniques based on graph theory, knot theory and algebraic topology that provide understanding of the structural patterns of the genome unscrambling pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dinnocenzo at the University of Rochester. Professor Dinnocenzo and his students investigate novel exciplexes (excited state complexes), especially cationic (positively charged) exciplexes. The research activities provide foundational knowledge about electron transfer and new types of exciplexes.  Substances which form exciplexes have potential applications as sensors, as biological probes, and in organic light emitting diodes (OLED). Due to their solubility in water, cationic exciplexes have enhanced potential for development of biological imaging applications. The research provides a rich educational experience for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, in  synthesis, electrochemistry and time-resolved spectroscopy. This research specifically engages undergraduates from the University of Guam (a minority institution in the US Territory) for summer research opportunities.  This group is underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>This project investigates two types of novel, charge transfer exciplex intermediates that were recently discovered in the Dinnocenzo laboratory. One type of exciplex is formed by reaction of cationic, excited state acceptors with neutral donors. Research objectives include determining the electronic nature of the exciplexes (e.g. electronic coupling matrix elements) through theoretical fitting of radiative lifetimes, which are determined by Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) and fluorescence spectra. This project expands the generality of cationic exciplexes by measuring some of their photophysical properties, examining cationic exciplexes in a variety of media (including water), and synthesizing intramolecular examples. A related project investigates examples uncovered in the Professor Dinnocenzo's lab where two exciplex emissions are observed from a single acceptor and donor. Preliminary results are consistent with dramatically different solvent reorganization energies for the two types of exciplexes, indicating major differences in their structures. In this research, students learn how to synthesize, purify, and spectroscopically characterize compounds. Students also receive training in a range of less traditional techniques including transient absorption spectroscopy (TCSPC), fluorometry, electrochemistry, and modern computational chemistry. The students trained through the research are prepared to tackle a variety of multidisciplinary problems in their professional careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PREM institutions are Minority Serving Institutions with a student population largely underrepresented in the field of materials research. The workshop will consist of three main components:  1) Lectures by CHESS staff scientists that cover the fundamentals of synchrotron methods and how these can be applied to materials research; 2) Hands-on demonstrations where participants will collect and process data on CHESS beamlines; and 3) Instruction and coaching on how to write a successful proposal for beamtime, with the opportunity for personalized feedback from CHESS scientists.  At the conclusion of the workshop, the participants will have the knowledge and demonstrated skills to be productive members of the CHESS user community.<br/><br/>The HEXT-2020 workshop will occur as part of the CHESS Users? Meeting in June 2020. Workshop participants will be able to attend sessions of the Users? meeting featuring updates of the facility operation, strategic planning and science presentations, as well as social events (meeting dinner, tour of CHESS). Attendees of the workshop will also participate in a poster session to share their scientific interests and learn about research at CHESS. There they will also have the opportunity to network with students already using synchrotron facilities, with the CHESS staff scien-tists who are responsible for x-ray beamlines, and with PIs who are facility users (from early career scientists to world-renowned distinguished researchers, all working in diverse fields).  The targeted audience for this workshop will have diverse scientific interests and will be new to the synchrotron community. Therefore, the workshop will cover a broad range of synchrotron methods?such as diffraction, spectroscopy, and imaging?that can be applied to many materials systems. Both lectures and hands-on sessions will focus on the fundamentals of the methods, with a special emphasis on how these techniques can be applied to materials systems. The experiments using CHESS beamlines will give participants firsthand experience with what it takes to conduct research at a synchrotron. By combining these educational activities with practice in preparing proposals, this workshop will uniquely equip participants to become active members in the CHESS user community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New techniques for manipulating light will enable better solutions to some of today?s biggest challenges, from maximizing efficiency in transforming sunlight into electricity to building faster computers. This project aims to control light at the quantum limit?one particle of light (or photon) at a time?using nanometer-scale metal structures. However, many questions remain about how such nanometer-scale structures affect individual photons. Thus, the first goal of this project is to develop new microscopy methods that will permit the study of light-matter interactions near these metal structures with unprecedented resolution. With this newfound understanding, the second goal is to use the nano-particles to construct the first step towards a quantum computer, which promises an explosion of power and speed in the computers of the future. This project also has broad goals to create space for all students to thrive, regardless of gender, race, and socioeconomic background. This will be achieved, in part, by expanding the scope of the Rensselaer Women in Physics group?s outreach activities to the local elementary and middle schools, and by incorporating diversity education into the physics curriculum. <br/><br/>The potential of quantum information science is fueling demand for the design and generation of new qubits and devices, such as transistors, operating at the single-particle level. Localized surface plasmon resonances in metal nano-particles offer the ability to confine the electromagnetic field to scales well below the diffraction limit of light, and promise the possibility of integratable devices operating at the quantum level. In particular, these plasmon resonances can strongly couple with molecular or semiconductor excitons to form new hybridized states. These states can be used to develop single-photon transistors and other building blocks of a functioning quantum circuit. However, several roadblocks have up to now limited plasmons? practical use. Indeed, although plasmonic modes present the advantage of coupling very strongly to matter, the very small mode volume in plasmonic cavities makes it difficult to get good spatial overlap with single emitters such as quantum dots. This research project proposes to design, develop, and characterize new methods for the fundamental investigation and precise control of the coupling between single quantum emitters and plasmonic nano-cavities. The research objectives include: (1) Developing a new tool to experimentally measure the local density of states using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, and to understand light-matter interactions in the vicinity of plasmonic nano-structures, beyond what can be learned from simulations of the structure design; (2) Achieving reproducible and controllable coupling between individual quantum emitters and a plasmonic nano-cavity using plasmonic optical trapping; (3) Studying the transition from weak to strong coupling regime in real time and using the strongly coupled system to demonstrate single photon blockade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objective of this conference is to bring together a broad range of researchers in Analysis, Mathematical Physics, Probability on Fractals and other research areas for the purpose of scientific exchange, planning of new projects, and education and training of entering researchers. These conferences have been held every three years starting in 2002. The five-day meeting will be structured in three parts: half-hour talks in the mornings by leading researchers in the field to describe recent important advances; mini-courses in the early afternoons to enable advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from related fields to learn some of the foundations of the area and discuss important open problems, and 20-minute talks in parallel sessions in the late afternoons to allow all attendees to present their research. A large number of early-career researchers, including members of underrepresented groups and undergraduate students, from both the Cornell SPUR and University of Connecticut REU programs, are expected to benefit from these courses. A number of applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists attend these conferences, so the conference will help foster the growing interactions between the mathematics and physics communities with interests in these areas.<br/><br/>There are many ways in which fractals appear in current mathematical research. The topics of this conference are those where the underlying space is fractal, and the subjects studied include the analogs of differential equations, random processes and models of physical interactions taking place on these fractal spaces. Due to the pioneering work of Barlow, Perkins, Bass, Kusuoka, Zhou and Kigami there is a well-established, rigorous mathematical framework for discussing such problems. This conference is expected to expand to new directions of research, including new trends in potential, geometric and probabilistic analysis on non-smooth and fractal spaces.

Geometric and asymptotic group theory is intra-disciplinary by nature, with researchers attacking similar problems but using techniques from vastly different areas (such as topological, geometric, or combinatorial techniques). The conference series draws top speakers and researchers in the subject and fosters connections to theoretical computer science, logic, combinatorics, cryptography, and many more.  The conference will be the 14th iteration of the annual GAGTA meetings.  It is the longest-running annual international conference series on the applications of group theory.  The grant will allow the supported US-participants to learn about new developments in the field, to communicate their research results, and to spark new research collaborations.<br/><br/>Funds will cover travel and local housing expenses of 15 US-based attendees, including four speakers. Priority for funding will be given to junior researchers and graduate students with limited sources of other funding, and among those to underrepresented minorities, women, and veterans. Geometric group theory enjoys a growing diversity, which this conference aims to promote further through the selection of the speakers and  participants. The conference will have approximately 25 talks from invited speakers and an afternoon of short talks from junior researchers.  The organizers strive particularly to have diversity reflected among the organizers and the speakers.  The topics discussed will include: combinatorial structures in geometric group theory and computer science (e.g. CAT(0) geometry, quasi-median spaces, partially commutative structures); complexity in computational group theory (practical and theoretical aspects such as generic complexity, low circuit complexity, NP-complete problems in group theory); and the first-order theory of groups and algebras, and arithmetic (e.g. in free groups, hyperbolic groups, solvable groups etc.).  Participants will be given ample time to discuss with each other, thus forging long-term collaborations and working relationships.  The conference will help disseminate fundamental ideas and newest research developments. There will be a public lecture on the applications of Coxeter groups and discrete geometry to the modeling of virus development and growth of cancer tumors.  https://sites.google.com/view/gagta2020<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
