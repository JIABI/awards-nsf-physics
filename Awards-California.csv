These algorithms enable large amounts of data to be distilled down to valuable insights. Nearly all industries have been transformed by these technologies, and new industries only possible due to these technologies are emerging. Unfortunately, the general-purpose hardware that enabled the past 50 years of computing is fundamentally unsuited to run AI algorithms efficiently. This research focuses on developing material growth techniques and specialized devices specifically tailored to addressing the needs of next generation computing algorithms. The outcome of this research is materials and devices that can be integrated directly with traditional hardware to improve the performance of AI with respect to speed and power. Thus, the results of this work can impact a wide variety of fields, ranging from semiconductors to self-driving cars. Graduate students working on this project are trained in materials, devices, and algorithms for AI, a critical need for the workforce of the future. Activities to bolster high school students? math and science skills are incorporated to encourage their interest in science and engineering related fields. A focus of these activities is the inclusion of underrepresented groups. The results of this research are published in journals, presented at conferences, and incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate level classes.<br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The primary goal of this project is to utilize crystalline III-V semiconductors on amorphous substrates as the material and device building blocks for future generations of neuromorphic processors. Neuromorphic computing architectures and systems have the potential to rapidly generate insight from massive datasets with very-low power compared to current von Neumann processor architectures. However, current implementations of analog accelerators based on non-volatile memory elements exhibit unacceptably low classification accuracy on model problems. Additionally, artificial neural network architectures still exhibit ~6-8 orders of magnitude greater energy consumption as compared to the brain. Here, an algorithm driven approach is used to design devices for artificial neural network and spiking neural network accelerators. These devices are fabricated and characterized using III-V high-mobility channels directly grown on amorphous substrates below 400 oC, enabling CMOS back-end integration compatibility. First, the performance limits of III-V?s grown on amorphous substrates are identified. Next, memory devices for artificial neural network synapses are designed, fabricated and characterized. Finally, spiking synaptic devices?artificial devices which mimic biological synapses are explored. The results of this work have the potential to enable specialized hardware for AI to be fabricated directly on traditional processors impacting all areas that presently utilize AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How this is done by the brain is still largely a mystery, and this is a central problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which has a vast scope of applications and is transforming our lives. One way to make sense of sensory data is to construct models to generate them, by assuming that the data are generated by some relatively simple hidden factors or causes. Such models are called generative models. To make sense of the data is to infer the hidden causes that generate the input data, and this can be accomplished by short-run computing dynamics. The main goal of this project is to develop such generative models and the associated short-run computing dynamics. The project has the potential to lead to new learning techniques that can be useful in applications such as computer vision. The PI will also train graduate students supported by this grant and further enhance the graduate and undergraduate courses taught by the PI. <br/> <br/>Generative models unify supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning in a principled likelihood-based framework. While supervised learning has met tremendous successes in recent years, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning remains a challenge. The bottleneck for likelihood-based learning of generative models is the intractable computation of expectations which usually requires expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, whose convergence can be problematic. The main motivation of the research is to get around this bottleneck. The following are specific aims of the proposed research: (1) Variational optimization of short-run MCMC dynamics for the sampling computations in likelihood-based learning of generative models, by combining the advantages of MCMC and variational inference. (2) Developing biologically plausible generative models with multiple layers of hidden variables, and the associated short-run inference and synthesis dynamics that can account for feedbacks and inhibitions between hidden variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These successes reverberate across a broad spectrum of data science problems. Nevertheless, theoretical understanding of deep learning is scarce. This project is aimed at building rigorous mathematical foundations for modern and future approaches to learning from big data. High-dimensional probability is proposed as a natural framework for the mathematical exploration of deep learning. This project has a double benefit. On the one hand, it is aimed at theoretically explaining the successes of deep learning. On the other hand, the project will inspire future theoretical developments in high-dimensional probability, especially in random matrix theory. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>This project will address theoretical problems in high-dimensional probability that are inspired by open problems in data science. A pressing need for mathematical justification is evident in the area of deep learning, whose stunning success on real-world data applications is not theoretically explained yet. This project proposes high-dimensional probability as a natural framework for the mathematical exploration of deep learning. A unifying theme of most of the problems in this proposal is nonlinear random matrix theory, where random matrices are transformed by a nonlinearity, which alters their spectral and geometric behavior. Nonlinearities empower neural networks and quantizers, underlie the concepts of random Boolean threshold functions, random tensors and geometric graphs. Exploring the unusual spectral behavior of pseudolinear and inhomogeoenous random matrices are the main general thrust of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This success is a synergy of several ingredients: (1) neural networks (NNs) as a flexible framework for representing high-dimensional functions and maps, (2) simple algorithms such as back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent for tuning the model parameters, (3) highly effective general software packages such as Tensorflow and Pytorch, and (4) unprecedented computing power. Despite the successes however, several key challenges remain: (1) the NN architectural design is still an art and it lacks basic mathematical principles in many cases, and (2) the NN training often requires an enormous amount of data, which is not available in many applications. Many computational problems in physical sciences also face the same challenges as those in data science: high-dimensionality, complicated or unspecified models, and large computational cost. Some well-known examples are many-body quantum systems, deterministic and stochastic control, molecular dynamics, uncertainty quantification, and inverse problems. It is natural to leverage the recent developments of NNs in the study of these problems. This project focuses on inverse problems, that is, recovering unknown problem parameters from observation data. It is a field of enormous importance, with applications in physics, chemistry, medicine, earth sciences, and defense. However, many inverse problems are known to be computationally challenging. This project will use deep learning as a means for solving these inverse problems more efficiently. The PI plans to develop a new applied linear algebra course with a machine learning focus and to organize workshops at the interface of deep learning and physical sciences. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students through the research and support one graduate student per year.<br/><br/>As a tool for representing high-dimensional maps, neural nets (NN) offer a flexible way for representing the full inverse maps and learn the data distribution prior via training. The rich mathematical and physical theories behind inverse problems provide theoretical guidance for designing compact yet effective NN architectures and hence it is possible to avoid the need for an enormous amount of data. In the theoretical part, this project plans to identify the commonly-used mathematical operators in many inverse problems and design novel NN modules for these operators. Two such examples are the pseudodifferential operators and the Fourier integral operators. Using analytical results from partial differential equations and numerical linear algebra, both types of operators can be represented compactly and accurately as NN modules. In the application part, this project considers five inverse problems: electric impedance tomography, optical tomography, inverse acoustic/electromagnetic scattering, seismic imaging, and travel-time tomography. The NN for the inverse map is then assembled using the modules from the theory part, along with existing primitives such as convolutional NN. The whole NN is then trained end-to-end with the training data. The research results such as publications and software will be made available in public domain. The project will also lead to broader impacts in several areas. First, this project advocates for a more principled approach for NN architecture design based on mathematical theories, sparsity considerations, and invariance/equivariance principles. Second, the project covers inverse problems from five different topics. By working with scientists and engineers, the PI plans to apply the technologies developed to practical applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zare at Stanford University is working on optimizing chemical reactions in microdroplets with deep reinforcement learning.  Unoptimized reactions are expensive because they waste time and reagents.  A common way for chemists to explore reaction optimization is to change one variable at a time while all other variables remain fixed. This method, however, might not find the best conditions, that is the global optimum.  Another way is to search across all combinations of reaction conditions by using batch chemistry. This approach gives a better chance to find the global optimal condition, but it is time-consuming and expensive. Deep reinforcement learning is believed to be a superior approach in which the computer analyzes a large data set and recognizes the pattern of features that lead to best reaction outcomes.  It is like training a dog: suppose we want the dog to pick up a ball.  If the dog does what we want, we say ""Good dog!""; if it does not, we say ""Bad dog!"". Similarly, Professor Zare uses a machine learning method to give the system a positive reward if the reaction reaches a better result than previous ones, or a negative reward if it does not.  A repeated process will eventually result in a set of best reaction conditions for certain reactions.  Professor Zare and his group apply this approach to microdroplet chemistry, where many reactions can be carried out in small droplets and be accelerated by factors of one thousand to one million compared with the same reaction happening in bulk solution. Combining the efficient deep reinforcement learning method with accelerated microdroplet reactions, Professor Zare and his group are seeking to find optimal reaction conditions in a fast way.  This combined approach can represent a significant step for enabling artificial intelligence to be used to optimize chemical reactions, which should have benefits in chemical production, drug screening, and materials discovery.  The students in the Zare group enjoy the unique opportunity to experience micro-droplet chemical synthesis, fast chemical characterization, and deep learning-based complex data analysis.<br/><br/>A reaction can be thought of as a system having multiple inputs (parameters) and providing one or more outputs. Example inputs include: temperature; solvent composition; pH; catalyst; droplet size; and time. Example outputs include: product yield; selectivity; purity; and cost. The goal of reaction optimization described here is to select the best inputs to achieve a given output, which can be formulated as a reinforcement learning system. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, Professor Zare is searching for critical reaction condition to try at the next step based on previous reaction conditions and product yields. A recurrent neural network is used to model the policy for reaction optimization. The reinforcement learning system is trained on mock reactions (random functions) and then real reactions for better performance.  The approach, if successful, could help better understanding of fundamental features of reactivity and enable important industrial applications."

This, precisely, is the key role of the guarantees given by statistical inference. The goal of this project is to investigate a novel inference methodology that precisely builds from inception data-driven decision-making rules with enhanced out-of-sample properties. This is achieved by introducing a game-theoretic formulation, in which the decision maker optimizes against an adversary that optimally exploits potential weaknesses of a decision when adding perturbations to the data (within reasonable size, yet arbitrary directions). A statistical framework is designed to estimate an optimal amount of data perturbations to obtain robust, yet practical, decision rules. The framework naturally leads to optimal (in certain sense) confidence regions for the underlying decision making parameters. The output of this project has implications in various areas of applied decision making under uncertainty, in particular, machine learning, artificial intelligence, operations management, and transportation are applications of special interest. The graduate student will work on computational methods for large scale optimal transport.<br/> <br/>The novel inference methodology to be investigated in this project unifies and extends a large class of estimators (such as generalized Lasso and regularized logistic regression among many others), which have been successfully applied in practice. These are encompassed within a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. A DRO formulation is a class of games in which the statistician chooses a parameter or an action to minimize certain expected loss and an adversary chooses a perturbation of the empirical measure against the statistician (maximizing the expected loss) within a certain size (called the distributional uncertainty size). In the context of this proposal, this perturbation is measured in terms of optimal transport costs (or Wasserstein distances). The use of the Wasserstein distance and the DRO formulation justifies the name Robust Wasserstein Profile Inference of this inference methodology. The proposal studies the optimal selection of the distributional uncertainty size and associated optimal confidence regions induced by the DRO formulation. Specific applications, for example, to shape constrained estimation and stochastic optimization problem in engineering will be studied by the PI. The proposed research provides a rich interplay between the theory of optimal transport, statistical inference and convex optimization. Finally, the PI will attempt to recruit high-quality personnel from under-represented groups. The PI will also disseminate the scientific output of this proposal via open access sites, in addition to the standard vehicles (conferences and journal publications).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to develop a computational tool that rapidly searches highly branched reaction pathways to identify the chemical structures of the products of organic reactions. Identifying the products of organic reactions would accelerate pharmaceutical synthesis, drug stability studies, and other advanced manufacturing requiring synthetic organic chemistry. The project lies at the interface of mechanistic organic chemistry, chemoinformatics, and machine learning. The training data is based on common depictions of organic reactions understandable by everyone from high school chemistry students to academic researchers.  The team is well-positioned to provide education and training for students underrepresented in science. Sophomore organic chemistry students will be engaged in benchmarking the progress in the ongoing evolution of machine vs. human prediction as applied to organic chemistry reactions.  <br/><br/>The first stage in predicting polar chemical reactivity is the identification of nucleophilic electron source atoms and electrophilic electron sink atoms. Chemists currently lack a database of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity parameters that covers the full span of nucleophilic functional groups, from carbon-carbon bonds to alkyl anions, and the full span of electrophilic functional groups, from carbon-carbon sigma antibonding orbitals to the empty orbitals of a cyanide cation. To fill this void in knowledge, methyl ion affinities are being calculated in a way that correlates them with solution phase reactivity parameters and those correlation values will be used to train Reaction Predictor in source and sink scoring. Dynamically adjusted thresholds will be evaluated to accommodate highly reactive or unreactive source or sinks. The current training set of tens of thousands of elementary reaction steps will be greatly expanded. In addition, Reaction Predictor will be trained to rank source-sink pairs occurring in any given set of reactants. Reaction Predictor will use these rankings to identify products and multistep reaction pathways for reactions carried out in the laboratory.  In addition, the Reaction Predictor will be made available on-line, enabling a robust user community to participate in artificial intelligence as applied to organic chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, deep networks typically consume billions of flops in computation and gigabytes of storage for model and data, rendering their deployment a challenge on mobile and energy limited platforms such as cellular phones and battery powered cars. The project aims to develop theory and algorithms for complexity reduction methods so as to maintain DNN's performance on low computational budget, achieving speed up and saving memory space.  The project also studies light weight deep networks through automated architecture search and selection to reduce complexity at a higher design level. A broad range of applications include mobile computer vision, disease diagnosis and detection,  face verification, as well as monitor and rescue missions by the drone. The project will actively involve graduate students and enrich their career development through both education and research activities. <br/><br/>The approaches to be studied include (1) training of deep networks with low-precision weights and activation functions (so called quantization), (2) hand-crafted and automated lightweight deep networks, their training via variable splitting and their quantization. The training of quantized networks concerns with minimizing high dimensional discontinuous non-convex objectives under discrete constraints, for which novel coarse gradients and an accelerated technique (so called blending) will be analyzed to guide the descent and reach convergence. A differentiable treatment of discrete constraints, and of non-smooth and combinatorial structures will be fully developed.

In particular, it will support research to reduce the amount of light that is ""lost"" when it hits the optics in gravitational-wave detectors and to apply Machine Learning techniques to find and remove disturbances in the detector data. This research will involve and provide transferable skills to a diverse team of undergraduate and Master's students at California State University Fullerton, a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution.

First, they will adapt techniques from Machine Learning to identify the physical processes that cause time-varying noise in the instruments and work to ameliorate them. This will increase the rate of gravitational-wave observations and the accuracy of the information extracted from them. Second, they will conduct experiments to identify the mechanisms behind light scattering in gravitational-wave detector optics, a key to the quantum noise that directly limits LIGO's sensitivity. A new instrument will be developed to test whether the long mysterious point-like scatter from LIGO optics is related to micro-crystals formed during annealing of the optics.

Existing computational solvers cannot be used directly for this purpose. On the other hand, many powerful techniques have been developed in data science to represent and compress data for useful information with extreme efficiency and low computational complexities. A crucial factor for the success of these methods is to exploit some special features in these high-dimensional data. The purpose of this project is to integrate physical models with data science to develop a new generation of computational methods that can solve large-scale physical or data science problems using only subsampled data and partial knowledge of the physical model. The mathematical analysis will help reveal certain important solution structures so that one can use techniques from data science to give accurate approximations for those quantities of interest. Without identifying these special solution structures and using the physical model as a constraint, the current techniques from data science cannot be used directly to achieve PI's goal. This project can have a substantial impact for the computational science and data science communities, for national technology and society. Additional impact will be the involvement of graduate students. This research provides a solid training in mathematical analysis, physical modeling, and data science. The interdisciplinary training they receive in this project will be very important for their future careers in mathematics and science.<br/>  <br/>The recent advances in data science offer tremendous opportunities for computational sciences. A key to the success in data science is to exploit some special features in the high-dimensional data. Traditional PDE solvers have not taken full advantage of the special solution structures. PDE analysis and data science complement each other. PDE analysis can identify some important solution structures that can help the PI to design a more effective deep generative network to solve the physical problem. Without the guidance from the PDE analysis, naive application of current machine learning algorithms to multiscale problems would fail. The solution of the nonconvex optimization problem can easily get stuck in local minimum and may converge to the wrong solution. The PI will identify some key ingredients that would make such integration successful, investigate what type of PDEs can be compressed and what algorithms can be used to approximate quantities of interest with a small percentage of subsampled data and partial knowledge of the physical model. This research will also provide valuable theoretical understanding of some deep learning methods for solving multiscale problems. The PI will consider both inverse and forward problems. For the forward problem, he will develop a novel multiscale method based on subsampled data to reconstruct the solution with guaranteed accuracy.  For the inverse problem, the PI will post it as a Bayesian inverse problem and use Deep Generative Networks. An essential ingredient in this approach is to introduce a novel multiscale invertible flow to approximate the transport map, which enables the PI to develop an efficient sampling algorithm to capture the multiple modes in the posterior distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organic electronic materials have recently emerged as attractive alternatives to inorganic counterparts in neuromorphic computing owing to their low-energy switching, excellent tunability, low fabrication costs, and biocompatibility. In this project, we will establish a collaborative, multidisciplinary and data-centric research program to accelerate the discovery of novel conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) with chemical structures tailored for the demands of neuromorphic computing. The project will bear direct impact on applications ranging from neuromorphic computing, to energy generation (photovoltaic and thermoelectric materials), sensing, robotics, and pathogen mitigation. The project will also provide cutting-edge educational and training opportunities to students and postdoctoral fellows who will gain valuable experience in data science, materials informatics, and data driven material research. The PIs are fully committed to broadening participation and enhancing diversity in materials research and education by strengthening opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

The research effort integrates high-throughput computation, machine learning, multiscale modeling, chemical synthesis, and materials and device characterization executed in a ""closed loop"" manner. The team will construct the first comprehensive database dedicated to CPEs, which includes a collection of structural, elastic, vibrational, electronic, dielectric, and energetic properties for over ten thousand CPEs. Based on the CPE database, the team will explore the correlations between the materials properties and formulate a set of molecular design rules. Materials characterization will be performed to validate the design rules and once validated, they will provide guidance for predictions of promising CPEs. Based on the predictions, the team will synthesize the most promising CPEs and examine their performance in the neuromorphic devices. The project has three deliverables: (1) The first comprehensive CPE database. (2) A fundamental understanding on how the backbone structure and adjacent electrostatic forces control CPE properties and a set of design rules for accelerated materials discovery. (3) A set of highly optimized and promising CPE structures for neuromorphic and optoelectronic applications. Successful completion of the project not only impacts neuromorphic computing, but also research areas, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, thermoelectrics, sensors and robotics.

This technological revolution has improved standards of living globally and has become a cornerstone of the modern economy. Recently, the rapid growth of computational power has slowed, in part because the size of hardware components has shrunk to microscopic scales. At microscopic scales, hardware behaves according to the laws of quantum mechanics, which are quite different from the laws expected for traditional computers. These differences have impeded continued growth using established hardware techniques, but also allow for new possibilities. Efforts are ongoing to develop a paradigm of hardware that leverages the nuances of quantum mechanics to accelerate computation. This project contributes to these quantum computing efforts by addressing a pressing simulation problem for superconducting quantum circuits, which are a promising candidate for scalable quantum technology. The difficulty in accurately describing such a quantum circuit grows rapidly with the size of the system, making hardware design challenging. If successful, this work will provide numerical methods and open source software that dramatically simplify this modeling task for common scenarios, which should help accelerate the future development of superconducting quantum circuits.<br/><br/>Large numbers of parameters are generally required to describe quantum circuits, making brute force simulation challenging. A particularly important example of this high dimensionality occurs during the standard measurement protocol for quantum circuits. In this protocol, traveling microwave fields couple with microwave resonators, which in turn couple with nonlinear oscillators that have several energy levels. As the traveling field is collected, the quantum system continuously evolves in accordance with the measured stochastic signal, producing complicated dynamics. This project will develop efficient methods for simulating these continuous quantum measurements using several design phases. After developing a full reference numerical model for the microwave amplification and readout circuitry on a multi-component chip, we will develop simplified semi-classical representations that compress the high dimensionality into a smaller number of parameters. These simplifications will extend known weak-field coherent steady-state approximations of the microwave dynamics to account for nonlinear effects. This project will explore the use of machine learning methods, particularly recurrent neural networks, to automatically learn how to compress the dynamics efficiently. In parallel, undergraduates will perform outreach to the local community through demonstrations, videos, and more to raise public literacy of quantum mechanics. This project will deliver open-source software, online interactive notes, and tutorials as part of its broad outreach effort.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stents are mesh-like tubes which are used to prop diseased arteries open. Several generations of stents have been designed to date. The currently used stents are drug eluting stents, and new generations of bare metal stents. Despite the beneficial effects of stenting, persistent high rates of complications such as in-stent restenosis and late stent thrombosis call for novel approaches to stent design. Recent ideas based on nano-engineered stents seem to be particularly promising. They include: (1) nano-engineered stents, which are stents covered with nano-engineered surface that promotes accelerated restoration of functional endothelium and provides a drug-free approach to keeping stents patent long-term; and (2) ferromagnetic stents with magnet-enhanced nano-particle drug delivery of anti-thrombogenic drugs for improved arterial wall healing. This project will addresses the development of new mathematical methods to guide and aid the bioengineering design of next generation stents. The methods are based on partial differential equations, particle-base kinetic methods, and artificial intelligence-based optimization methods. The mathematical and computational results will be experimentally tested in the Therapeutic Microtechnology and Nanotechnology Lab at UCSF. Two students and a postdoc will be involved in the project, and topics from this research will be presented in a new, interdisciplinary class at UC Berkeley, cross-listed in three different departments (Mathematics, Bioengineering, and Mechanical Engineering).

The common research theme of the training activities is how to leverage the predictive power of statistical machine learning to address questions of causality and interpretability. The project aims to prepare the next generation of statisticians and data scientists to tackle new, important problems that arise from the analysis of massive data. Intuitively it seems that more reliable and precise inferences can be drawn from larger data sets. However, decisions and interventions must be interpretable and justified by statistical measures of uncertainty, which are challenging in this setting.  This program will infuse ideas, energy, and resources in an integrated way at all levels of the educational program, from the undergraduate major to the postdoctoral experience, recruiting students and preparing them to participate in the extraordinary range of opportunities in this exciting new field.<br/><br/>The research in this project will pursue theory to bridge the gap between causal inference and machine learning research, including high-dimensional inference, multiple testing, causal inference with interference, and causality and gene expression. The project is at the frontiers of statistics and data science, bridging the divide between machine learning and causal inference with potential impact far beyond the discipline of statistics. Plans are to redesign and expand the engagement of undergraduates in research through a graduate student mentorship program; to design new courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels, including an introductory course that builds on connections between data science, social sciences, and ethics; and to enhance graduate research training via a research symposium. The program will include a graduate professional development training series that addresses topics in technology, presentation and writing skills, and building an inclusive science community.  The project will also provide significant training in teaching for graduate students and postdoctoral associates. Through a combination of channels, the innovations in training will spread to other institutions and disciplines, e.g., demonstrating the power of machine learning in policy and education settings where causal inference is central. The program also includes the development of educational materials with plans to disseminate them widely throughout the broader community.

The complex nature of large-scale observational data, such as its massive volume and high dimensions in confounders, pose great challenges to the existing conventional methods for causal analysis. The corresponding statistical implication is that even a small amount of bias can easily lead to erroneous conclusions. Thanks to the rapid development of scalable computing techniques, nonparametric machine learning methods have a strong potential for bias reduction via employing data-driven strategies for dimensionality reduction. However, careful consideration must be given in order to realize the potential for studying the underlying causal mechanisms. This project aims to develop cutting-edge statistical methods with theoretical insights for causality analysis using deep neural networks. The new statistical tools meet the immediate needs from various scientific areas for exploring causal relationships from large-scale observational data. The research will facilitate the causality analysis of modern complex data with important applications. This project will integrate research and education through course development, open-source software development, and undergraduate and graduate student training. <br/> <br/>The PI will develop a new unified approach with thorough theoretical justifications for efficient estimation of causal effects using deep neural networks. The method will then be applied to large-scale datasets with binary, multi-valued, or continuous-valued treatment variables. Three interconnected topics will be pursued. Specifically, the PI will offer a new perspective on learning treatment effects through a generalized optimization estimation. As a result, two convenient and efficient estimators of treatment effects will be developed, respectively, in the second and third topics. The estimators involve one nuisance model that will be approximated by deep neural networks, which will be investigated in the first topic. The general optimization framework includes the average, quantile and asymmetric least squares treatment effects as special cases. The methods take full advantage of the large sample size of large-scale data and provide effective protection against model mis-specification bias. The project involves devising new machine learning methods and algorithms for causal studies, establishing the theoretical validity, and developing valid inference procedures. It will promote machine learning methods for causality analysis, and will break new ground in drawing causal inference from large-scale observational datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to equip these decision-making algorithms with measures of uncertainty so that, where appropriate, human or further computer intervention can be used to ensure fair and safe outcomes. The junior researchers involved in the program will also engage in outreach programs, organized through Cal Tech. These outreach programs are aimed at high school students, and designed in particular to impact on a diverse range of high school students; this outreach work will be enhanced by experience with the research about equipping everyday algorithms with measures of uncertainty.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to obtain a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms. This will be achieved by formulating and solving the problems in a statistical fashion in which uncertainty in both the mathematical models used for learning, and the data used to train them, is tracked and quantified. The objectives are twofold: (i) to improve existing algorithms by allowing them to be cognizant of their own uncertainties, or by allowing humans to interact with them in an informed fashion; (ii) to use knowledge of uncertainties to study the predictive power of the algorithms and identify laws or rules implicitly encoded within them. A Bayesian formulation of a number of machine learning tasks will be adopted, with focus on neural networks, and related issues arising in graph-based semi-supervised learning. Recent advances in the development of Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) samplers in high dimensions will be deployed to make empirical studies of uncertainty.

More recently, machine learning is entering new fields, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and medicine. However, these models are often not robust to perturbations and are vulnerable to attacks by adversaries. These shortcomings warrant an urgent and insightful understanding of the ""black-box"" nature of these models. The principal investigator plans to understand these models by characterizing their ""complexity"" in a technical manner. A new complexity measure, based on the principle of minimum description length, sheds insight into classical statistical foundations as well as informing how and when these new high-dimensional models will work. This novel complexity measure is promising to enable applications to mission-critical fields like precision medicine, where the collection of a labeled dataset is expensive, by sample-size calculations and improving model selection with limited data. This research has both theoretical and applied impacts in the fields of statistics and machine learning including deep learning. In the duration of the project, graduate students will be trained in theory, domain-driven data science, and open-source software development. The research will be further disseminated through courses, an upcoming book, and presentations at workshops and conferences.<br/><br/>Deep neural networks (DNNs) in many cases generalize well in the sense that a DNN trained on one task often performs well on similar unseen data for the same task. They can do so despite being highly overparameterized, i.e., the number of parameters is much larger than the number of training samples.  Occam's razor and the bias-variance trade-off wisdom suggest to prefer a simple model when choosing from amongst models of varying complexity with similar performance. The good performance of DNNs, despite the overparametrization, has led many researchers to question the validity of the classical statistical principle of bias-variance trade-off (and preferring a simple model) for high-dimensional settings common in modern machine learning (ML) and statistical tasks.  In this project, the principal investigator begins by reconsidering the definition of a valid complexity measure ? which forms the basis of Occam?s razor and the bias-variance trade-off principle ? for high-dimensional models. Finding one such measure for high-dimensional models has remained a difficult task.  Merely counting the number of parameters is not a valid complexity measure, especially when the number of training examples is small.  The principle of minimum description length will be used to provide a systematic approach to understanding the complexity of high-dimensional linear models, kernel methods, and finally DNNs. The complexity measure will serve as a basis for understanding key concepts such as the bias-variance trade-off and for further analysis into high-dimensional models. The theoretical results will be augmented with an extensive set of data-inspired experiments.  After establishing the bias-variance trade-off with the new complexity measures, these measures will then be investigated for (i) selecting a simple model from amongst a set of competitive models, where simple will be defined via the MDL-based complexity and not the number of parameters, and (ii) regularizing or pruning a large (pre-trained) model, for example, in a transfer learning setting with limited dataset, by trading off the training performance with the complexity of the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main approach will be to use fast randomized matrix algorithms, as developed within the research area known as Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA).  Prior work has shown that these RandNLA algorithms come with strong theory and that they perform well for many practical data science and machine learning problems.  The foundation will develop novel uses of randomization to combine complementary algorithmic and statistical perspectives. The statistical viewpoint attributes randomness to an inherent and desirable property of the data, while the algorithmic viewpoint claims randomness as a computational resource to be exploited.  The coupling of these complementary approaches poses challenging mathematical problems to be investigated in the proposed work.<br/><br/>The proposed work will establish the foundations for fast prototyping in two directions: A Multi-Pronged Direction to bring RandNLA to the next level and explore what is technically feasible; and an overarching Synergy Direction that fuses the results for prototyping. The Multi-Pronged Direction includes the following topics: (i) Matrix perturbation theory, to bridge the gap between traditional worst-case bounds for asymptotically small perturbations on the one hand; and perturbations caused by stochastic noise, and missing or highly corrupted matrix entries on the other hand. (ii) Implicit versus explicit regularization, where randomness as a computational resource for speeding up algorithms additionally contributes to implicit statistical regularization, thereby improving statistical and numerical robustness. (iii) Krylov space methods for fast computation of good warm-starts and computation of surrogate models in the form of low-rank approximations, and specifically a better understanding of these methods in an algorithm-independent setting. (iv) Randomized basis construction methods that use matrix factorizations to compute low-rank approximations at low to moderate levels of accuracy. The Synergy Direction will explore topics like ultra-low accuracy matrix computations in machine learning applications, where merely a correct sign or exponent is sufficient. As a group, the PIs possess unrivaled and complementary expertise in applying fundamental mathematical tools to numerical applications in machine learning, data mining and scientific computing.  Importantly, the proposed methods will have significant impact in big data analysis, scientific computing, data mining and machine learning, where matrix computations are of paramount importance. The proposed work is fundamentally interdisciplinary and will enable fast, yet user-friendly extraction of insight from large-scale data these societally-important scientific domains.  Specifically, the proposed work will (i) create a numerically reliable and robust footing for fast prototyping; (ii) advance mathematics at the interface of computer science and statistics, one of the objectives being a synergy of numerical and statistical robustness; and (iii) advance the development of an interdisciplinary community with RandNLA as a pillar for the mathematics of data.

Existing databases do not contain information about the synthesis recipes necessary to make compounds that are found to have promising properties, designed through computational methods. As a result, much of the momentum and efficiency gained in the design process becomes gated by trial-and-error synthesis techniques. This delay in going from promising materials concept to validation, optimization, and scale-up is a significant burden to the commercialization of novel materials. This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) research will build predictive tools for synthesis so that the development time for chemical compounds with interesting properties can be synthesized in a matter of days, rather than months or years. The research activities include automatically extracting information from the published literature and patents on how solid inorganic materials have been made in the past by using natural language processing techniques. After this text extraction the project will generate a ""cookbook"" of materials synthesis recipes. This cookbook can be mined through machine learning approaches for suggestions on how to make new materials by looking for patterns and similarities among previously made materials. The project outcome will be a data set of materials synthesis methods, to be made available to the community. Another key project outcome is to use machine learning to predict novel or optimized recipes for materials. These predictions will be accompanied by experimental confirmation for a class of materials used in catalysis called zeolites. The major objective of the outreach component of this research is to enable the use of the database by non-experts.  This will be accomplished through both online tutorials and in person workshops.  The online tutorials will teach the basic knowledge required to utilize the online tools and functionalities while the workshops will be addressed to students and researchers who want to make use of the database itself. <br/><br/>The approach to automatic extraction of information in the literature will be semi-supervised from a machine learning perspective. Unsupervised methods, including word embeddings that capture the context of words within scientific corpus, will be used. Then downstream supervised methods will be used to classify words by their type and their relationship to other words. This forms the basis of the recipe database. The extracted information will then be mined using machine learning tools from the materials informatics community. Because the recipe classification (described subsequently) leverages expertise from the NLP perspective and the target material classification leverages expertise from the materials perspective, there is significant leverage to be had from this interdisciplinary approach, a partnership not previously pursued to further materials design. This approach builds on established synthesis knowledge, and combines it with modern data extraction, materials informatics, text mining and machine learning techniques, and high-throughput ab-initio thermochemical data availability. The integration of these different fields will provide a direct route towards more rational design of synthesis methods and thereby significantly accelerate the deployment and testing of new materials concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Burke of the University of California, Irvine is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to improve the accuracy and applicability of density functional calculations of electronic structure. Density functional theory (DFT) is a popular approach to computationally studying molecules and materials, allowing the design of new pharmaceuticals and materials using computers. The method has been used in more than 30,000 scientific papers each year and has resulted some impressive successes in predicting useful molecules.  For example, it has been used to find a better catalyst for making ammonia, an important starting material in chemical processes producing plastics, textiles, fertilizers, dyes and other chemicals.  DFT was also used to find the world's hottest superconductor, hydrogen sulfide under pressure. DFT is also used in many machine-learning applications in the physical sciences. However, even the best approximate density functionals, the basic component of DFT, have limited accuracy and ranges of applicability. Dr. Burke and his group are developing DFT methods that use machine learning to create new approximations in order to improve the computational results. He is also studying the origins of the approximations that underly DFT.  The resulting improvements in DFT may have significant technological and economic impacts.  Dr. Burke broadens understanding of DFT by hosting schools around the world and by training both undergraduate and graduate students in this important cross-disciplinary area of research.<br/><br/>Dr. Burke plans to improve DFT calculations in three distinct ways: One approach that is very novel (machine-learning), one very pragmatic and simple (density-corrected DFT), and one very old and deep (semiclassical approximations to functionals).  Dr. Burke has pioneered the creation of new functionals with machine learning (ML). These functionals depend on the density everywhere in space, i.e., are radically different for the local and semilocal approximations that form the heart of most modern DFT exchange-correlation functionals.  Dr. Burke is investigating approaches to broadening the applicability of ML density functionals. Regarding density-corrected DFT, he is evaluating functionals on Hartree-Fock densities. He uses a new method for the so-called semiclassical approximations which may lead to much more accurate kinetic energy and exchange energy functionals for realistic systems than any in use today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Globally, an estimated 422 million people had diabetes. In the United States, about 8.3% of the population currently has diabetes and that number is projected to grow to 1 in 3 adults by 2050. The current treatment for high blood sugar is frequent self-administration of insulin injections and monitoring of blood sugar levels throughout the day is necessary to sustain life for patients with type 1 or advanced type 2 diabetes. Lack of tight control of blood sugar levels accounts for many chronic complications of diabetes, such as limb amputation, blindness and kidney failure; while low blood sugar levels result in life disruption and the risk of seizures, unconsciousness, brain damage, or possible death. Current insulin infusion approaches, however, cannot mimic normal physiological conditions in which the pancreatic cells quickly releases insulin in response to increase in blood sugar levels, and insulin levels are shut down once the blood sugar is normal. This proposal is to develop the next-generation blood glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems that are based on synthetic vesicles in a biomimetic manner, inspired by the vesicles (or granules) of pancreatic celIs. The planned insulin delivery system will be able to automatically regulate insulin release continuously and repeatedly according to blood sugar levels. Towards this goal, the PI proposes to develop transformative glucose-responsive insulin nanoparticles (GRINs) for intelligently regulating blood sugar levels with fast and repeatable responsiveness. The activation of GRINs and subsequent release of insulin are expected to be triggered at a high blood sugar level, and the release is inhibited with a normal blood sugar range, thereby mimicking pancreatic cells to ""secrete"" insulin in response to fluctuating blood sugar levels. The GRINs prepared will be further loaded into a painless microneedle array-based patch on the skin to achieve easy administration and enhanced biocompatibility. This project will develop novel materials, formulations and devices that may be of broad use for development of other bio-responsive smart drug delivery systems. In addition, the proposed research will create dynamic and sustainable education activities, including a K-12 based outreach module 'Engineering Our Way to Stop Diabetes', an interdisciplinary curriculum targeting undergraduates and graduates, together with hands-on lab research. Such activities are expected to inspire students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>Technical: <br/>Diabetes is a major public health problem currently affecting about 422 million people across the world, and this number is expected to reach over 450 million by 2030. Current treatment for Type 1 and advanced Type 2 diabetic patients requires continuous monitoring of blood glucose (BG) levels and periodical insulin injections to maintain normal blood glucose levels. An artificial pancreas-like closed-loop insulin delivery system that continuously and intelligently releases insulin in response to changing blood glucose levels holds great promise for enhancing heath and improving quality of life for patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. To date, mimicking the function of pancreatic cells, chemically-controlled closed-loop delivery strategy utilizing synthetic materials and/or modified insulin have been widely explored. This typically consisted of polymeric formulations that swell, shrink or dissociate to adjust the insulin release rate according to ambient glucose levels. However, challenges remain to demonstrate a system which would combine; i) fast response; ii) repeatable activation; iii) ease of administration; and iv) excellent biocompatibility. The proposed project aims to develop the next-generation glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems, inspired by the ""natural"" granules of pancreatic cells. The PI will explore 'artificial' glucose-responsive insulin nano-granules (GRINs) and their relevant devices. The activation of GRINs and subsequent release of insulin are expected to be rapidly triggered at high blood sugar state, and inhibited within a normal blood sugar levels in a repeatable manner. The GRINs developed will be further integrated into a painless microneedle array-based device for application on skin, and thus achieving easy administration and enhanced biocompatibility. This project will also guide the development of novel materials, formulations and devices for engineering other delivery systems which can be intelligently activated by the variation of physiological signals. Moreover, the proposed research program will be closely integrated with dynamic and sustainable educational activities, through development of a K-12 outreach module- 'Engineering Our Way to Stop Diabetes', a new interdisciplinary curriculum targeting undergraduates and graduates, as well as hands-on lab research. Students will be exposed to biomaterials, devices and micro-nanotechnology, inspiring them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines."

The field of statistics is pressed to develop methodologies that can be used for answering such scientific challenges. Many of these scientific challenges can be addressed by first attempting to decrease size and complexity of the data through what is called feature extraction. In a second step these features are used to devise sound statistical methodologies. This project considers extracting information about the shape of the data, and is developing and studying statistical and machine learning methodologies based on these features. The outcomes of this project are expected to impact the fields of statistics, machine learning and various fields of application. Existing collaborations of the PI with biologists, animal scientists and material scientists, will also facilitate dissemination to these fields. This project will also provide training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The contributions of this project will lie in the intersection of statistics and machine learning. They will enhance toolboxes and advance knowledge through the derivation of novel methodologies, through developing a deep understanding of these methodologies by performing relevant theoretical analyses, and by providing implementations of the methodologies that are useful for practical purposes. More specifically, this project will (i) study the role of the Hodge Laplacian in the context of analyzing higher-relational data, including its role in clustering; (ii) derive theoretical results about stabilizing statistics such as Betti-curves that allow the construction  of asymptotically exact bootstrap based confidence intervals for functionals of persistent Betti-curves;  (iii) develop a novel, statistically enhanced persistence diagram thought the use of multiple testing, and (iv) Implementations will allow the exploration of finite sample properties of the new methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bayesian inference and global optimization are two powerful methods for learning from such data, but the large size of the data sets and the resulting computational difficulties greatly limit the applicability of these methods.  The research in this project aims to increase computational efficiency of these methods, thereby substantially expanding their usefulness for the analysis of large data sets. The methods and algorithms from this research will be implemented on modern distributed computing platforms and made freely available for the scientific community. The results will have wide applications in statistics and machine learning.<br/><br/>Specifically, the use of mini-batches in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) will be investigated. MCMC is perhaps the most widely used computational approach for Bayesian statistical inference. Since each step in the simulation of the Markov chain requires the scanning of all the observations, for a large data set this computation is prohibitive. On the other hand, in the area of machine learning researchers have found that stochastic optimization techniques, which examine only a mini-batch of data points at a time, can deliver excellent performance. In this project, a framework for unifying mini-batch based MCMC and global optimization will be developed. It is showed that simulation from of a tempered version of the posterior distribution can be approximated by a MCMC process with Metropolis-Hasting updates that depend only on mini-batches. This approach will be combined with eqi-energy sampling to achieve a unified simulation and global optimization methodology. This framework will allow us to improve the performance of both MCMC methods and non-convex global optimization methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our understanding and modeling of the large-scale dynamics of the Earth climate system and associated regional-scale climate variability significantly affects our ability to predict and mitigate climatic extremes and hazards. Earth observations and climate model outputs are witnessing an unprecedented increase in data volume, creating new opportunities to advance climate science but also leading to new data science challenges that must be addressed using tools from mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This project focuses on two central challenges at the heart of modern data-enabled climate science: (1) Increasing the predictive capacity of subseasonal forecasts by discovering and quantifying the sources of (un)predictability, including known and emergent climate modes and their interactions and non-stationarities; and (2) Understanding and quantifying the intricate space-time dynamics of the climate system to provide guidance for climate model assessment and regional forecasting.  This project brings together an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in both hydroclimate science and statistical machine learning to create new platforms for climate diagnostics and prognostics.  The broader impacts of an enhanced knowledge of the climate system and robust and accurate seasonal forecasts have wide-ranging implications for society as a whole. For example, better seasonal forecasts will allow water resource managers to make sustainable decisions for water allocation.<br/><br/>This TRIPODS+CLIMATE project will develop novel machine learning and network estimation methodologies for analyzing the climate system over a range of space and time scales, to understand climate modes of variability and change and to explore their predictive ability for regional hydroclimatology. The two main objectives of this project are the following.  Objective 1: Develop novel classification and regression tools that account for highly-correlated features or covariates, nonlinear interaction terms in high-dimensional settings, and nonstationarity in climate observations. These tools will be used to improve seasonal-to-subseasonal forecasts of regional precipitation using multidimensional climate modes and feature vectors in the presence of evolving dynamics and nonstationarities. Objective 2: Develop network identification methods that leverage recent advances in machine learning and statistics and that can account for the nonstationarity and limited timeframe of climate data. The network representation will be used to analyze the structure and dynamics of the learned dependencies to contextualize and interpret them physically, and to quantify changing patterns in climate modes and their regional predictive capacity.  Emphasis will be placed on the western Pacific dynamics where an interhemispheric bi-directional connection has recently been discovered, promising earlier and more accurate seasonal-to-subseasonal forecasts in the southwestern US and other parts of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models are a powerful tool for analyzing large volume, high-dimensional data in an unsupervised way. While generative models are an active research topic in machine learning, many theoretical and computational questions for such models remain unclear. This collaborative research project will study generative models from a geometric perspective, focusing on both performance guarantees and efficient implementations. The ability to efficiently create new data points that are guaranteed to be similar to the existing data has important implications in a variety of applications, including medical data analysis and privacy, bioinformatics, modeling of image and audio signals, and general high-dimensional data analysis in which it is difficult to collect labeled data for supervised algorithms.<br/><br/>The ideas and approaches in this research project center around the techniques that have evolved in the manifold learning field over the past decade. These mathematical tools, in particular local neighborhood preserving maps, approximation analysis in terms of intrinsic dimensionality, and construction of global coordinate systems based upon local affinity, have natural applications in the study of generative models. The project is comprised of four fundamental questions that arise in the field: (a) What are the types of distributions that generative networks are capable of learning efficiently, and how does the intrinsic dimensionality of the distribution affect convergence? (b) How can non-parametric generative models be created for dimension-reduced representations that arise in manifold learning, and which only depend on the intrinsic geometry of the data? (c) How can efficiently-computed metrics be defined between high-dimensional distributions for use in assessing the validity of various generative models? (d) How can these metrics be used to examine the various paths generative models take through the parameter space while being trained, and what clusters of starting points give optimal generators?

The laser-driven proton beams to be generated in this project are expected to achieve relativistic speeds with favorable properties to reduce the size and cost of future accelerator facilities. For this purpose, a new Stanford jet target technology will be combined with a high-power laser at the Tel-Aviv Intense Lasers and Ultrafast Science facility in Israel, which has one of the fastest repetition rates in the world, firing 10 times per second.

This scalability is crucial in various applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, nonconvex optimization is computationally unstable or even infeasible in general due to unfavorable local minima that may exist. In consequence, statistical properties for global minimum based estimates may not provide meaningful guidelines for practitioners. This project aims to study the statistical properties of local minimum based estimates for nonconvex optimization methods in a range of unsupervised learning problems. The proposed research projects are significant in identifying reliable nonconvex frameworks by understanding the trade-off between computational feasibility and statistical efficiency.

In order for a distributed system to be able to perform high-level tasks that may go beyond the capability of an individual agent, the system must first solve a ""clock synchronization"" problem to establish a shared notion of time. The study of clock synchronization (or coupled oscillators) has been an important subject of research in mathematics and various areas of science for decades, with fruitful applications in many areas including wildfire monitoring, electric power networks, robotic vehicle networks, large-scale information fusion, and wireless sensor networks. However, there has been a gap between our theoretical understanding of systems of coupled oscillators and practical requirements for clock synchronization algorithms in modern application contexts. This project will develop systematic approaches for bridging this gap based on combinatorial and probabilistic methods. The use of discrete oscillators will be a key thread in developing more robust and efficient clock synchronization algorithms, extending the current proof techniques for convergence guarantee, and providing a foundation for a data-driven approach to the clock synchronization problems.  This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels <br/><br/>One of the key difficulties in analyzing the behavior of coupled oscillators lies in the cyclic hierarchy in the phase space. A widely used observation in the literature is that, if all initial phases are concentrated in an open half-circle, such a cyclic hierarchy disappears and we have robust synchronization results in various settings. Hence deriving global synchronization from arbitrary initial configurations not only warrants self-stabilization of the clock synchronization algorithm under arbitrary perturbation, but also addresses the theoretical limitation of such a half-circle condition. By extending techniques such as local concentration and adaptive pulse-coupling scheme due to the PI, the project aims at deriving global synchronization from an arbitrary initial configuration on undirected finite trees, for non-identical natural frequencies and non-zero propagation delay of signals with optimal bounds on convergence time. The convergence result will be extended to arbitrary graphs by combining with a spanning tree algorithm, and the composite algorithm will be implemented as a fast and resource-minimal clock synchronization algorithm for modern wireless sensor networks. This project will also include interdisciplinary collaboration and research opportunities for students at all levels. In particular, some of the projects involve generating a large database for the collective behavior of some models of discrete coupled oscillators on finite graphs, and applying machine learning techniques to extract key features of the pair of network topology and initial configuration that guarantee synchronization. The project will provide students with research experiences ranging from dynamical systems to computer science and machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As it spreads through the human population the virus mutates producing proteins that can lead to higher infection rates (infectivity), and an increased ability to cause severe disease (virulence). This project will predict the most likely mutations of the virus by combining methods from machine learning, mathematics and biophysics.   Specifically, the proteins resulting from viral mutations will be experimentally synthesized, and their infectivity and virulence will be tested by the project team through a collaboration with researchers in industry. This project benefits from unprecedented access to genomic data compiled on SARS-CoV-2, combined with a rich set of novel tools developed through interdisciplinary advances in data science, mathematics, and biophysics. The results of this project will build a pipeline capable of assisting the development of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 while simultaneously advancing the fields of machine learning and mathematical virology. The project team is led by mathematicians, molecular biologists and biotechnology experts working in an interdisciplinary and collaborative setting. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained and will participate in publicly disseminating the findings and results of the project.<br/><br/> <br/>The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is believed to have originated as a bat virus and to have evolved through a combination of sequence mutations, recombination, and natural selection to be infectious in human hosts. Some of the most relevant sequence variations occurred in the S gene encoding the Spike (S) protein. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the human population, mutations of the S gene can potentially increase viral infectivity and virulence. Within the framework of an evolutionary algorithm, the PIs will combine graph theory, topological data analysis, and computational biophysics to characterize the most likely mutations of the S protein. This powerful interdisciplinary approach will draw upon existing experimental data from SARS-CoV-2. The PIs will collaborate with an industrial partner to experimentally design the peptides corresponding to those predicted sequences, and  use binding affinity assays and cryo-electron microscopy to test binding of the peptides to the human receptor (ACE2). The resulting pipeline will help us better understand the evolutionary landscape of viral proteins and will assist researchers in the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. Future extensions of this work will increase our understanding of how viruses are transmitted across species and propagate in humans. The project will provide multi-disciplinary student and postdoctoral training. The PIs will broadly disseminate their results, as well as the data they collect and software they design.<br/><br/>With this award, the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry are supporting Drs.

Professor Wender and his coworkers are investigating the design, synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of new materials that complex, protect, deliver, and release negatively-charged cargos such as RNA and DNA inside of living cells. These cargos are of unsurpassed importance in life science research, and these studies have potential utility in understanding cancer, protein therapy, allergy tolerization, neuroscience, universal flu vaccine development, disease detection and gene editing. These new materials are first-of-their-kind positively-charged carriers, designed to electrostatically grab on to the negatively-charged cargos. After cell entry, the positively-charged carriers change their physical properties, dynamically losing their positive charge and thereby releasing their negatively-charged cargo. The released RNA/DNA cargos contain a molecular message that is then translated by cellular machinery to produce proteins with research, diagnostic and other benefits. Coworkers trained in this program are becoming the next generation of scientific thought leaders and educators, joining over 300 former coworkers of Professor Wender who are now in leading positions in academia and the biotechnology industry. Many are also involved with science education at the college and high school levels. Professor Wender is also hosting visits from high school students, providing input on science projects, and lecturing at several science-for-non-scientist events. He has pioneered a new undergraduate course on scientific communication and innovation (SCI) (https://news.stanford.edu/2017/11/30/undergraduates-start-popular-science-publication/), engaging undergraduates in teaching high school and college students about science. This has led to a new undergraduate organization that is sharing and celebrating the fun, excitement and value of science through their web site and other media (https://fascinatepublication.org). <br/><br/>In this project, Professor Wender is studying the design, synthesis, and evaluation of new dynamic functional materials for the delivery of probes, imaging agents, catalysts, and other cargo across biological barriers. To accomplish this, he is developing new reactions, reagents, and catalysts for synthesis, and developing machine learning for retrosynthetic analysis and material design. The intellectual foundation of these studies is intrinsically chemical - synthesis, computer learning, and materials science, with potentially profound consequences in life science research. Increasingly in chemistry and in Professor Wender's research, mechanistic and synthetic chemistry have been integrated into studies directed at the design, synthesis and evaluation of functional materials of scientific and societal value (e.g. catalysts, imaging agents, sensors, molecular machines, diagnostics, drug delivery systems). The proposed research is primarily directed at the design, synthesis and evaluation of dynamic materials that complex, protect, deliver and release in cells polyanions such as RNA and DNA, representing the single most significant bottleneck to the advancement of many new RNA/DNA technologies. In this program, new classes of materials are being studied which serve initially as cations that electrostatically complex polyanions and subsequently change their physical properties, through an O-to-N acyl shift mechanism, thereby converting to neutral byproducts and releasing their polyanionic RNA/DNA cargo. The delivery vehicles, referred to as charge-altering releasable transporters (CARTs), represent a novel challenge in synthesis as unlike most synthetic targets which are selected for their stability, CARTs are designed to degrade. This project is synthesizing unprecedented monomeric, dimeric and dendrimeric CARTs (non-oligomeric CARTs), exploring the factors that influence their performance and the rules for their use in delivering cargos into living cells. These intrinsically chemical and synthetic studies are directed at goals that enable new opportunities in biology, imaging, materials science, and medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transportation of natural gas from remote sources to these central locations is often not economical. As a result, natural gas is often discarded by flaring at the well, while the oil is recovered. Natural gas, which is mostly methane, and its flaring product, carbon dioxide, are both potent greenhouse gases. Development of catalytic processes that convert natural gas into economically-transportable liquids at these well sites is very desirable. In this project, Professor Chong Liu of the University of California, Los Angeles is developing a new approach using electricity to convert light alkanes, including methane, into liquid products. Dr. Liu is studying new electrochemical catalysts and investigating the fundamental mechanisms of these reactions. Dr. Liu is actively engaged in outreach and education activities to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities include the introduction of chemistry topics to local gardeners and farmers in the Los Angeles area as well as undergraduate advising for general chemistry courses assisted by machine learning.<br/><br/>With the funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Liu of the University of California, Los Angeles is developing a mechanistic understanding of how early transition metal-oxo species break the carbon-hydrogen bond in methane during the catalysis.

In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective strategy for preventing HIV transmission is to implement the ?treatment as prevention? approach, that is, antiretroviral medication to achieve undetectable viral load in patients, thereby preventing sexual transmission. For treatment and cure of HIV infection, one of the viable options is to begin therapy early in infection before the establishment of virus reservoirs such as latent infected CD4+ T cells and infected brain cells. This project develops and uses mathematical models of cell-virus interactions and computational methods to study the effectiveness of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), including a recently developed nanoparticle-based preventive therapy (NBPT), for treatment of HIV. The study will focus on HIV infections in three critical sites: vaginal mucosa, circulation, and brain. In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, and nanomedicine, this research will have a significant positive and practical impact on the development of therapies and vaccines for the control of HIV.<br/><br/>This project aims to generate novel nonautonomous systems of differential equations to study the effects of ART pharmacodynamics on the spatiotemporal distribution of HIV virus in vaginal mucosa and on the persistence of HIV in the virus reservoirs. The project will utilize experimental data from HIV infected humans and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) infected macaques, as well as data from experiments on effectiveness of ARTs and NBPTs, for the model validation and the parameter estimation. The developed models will be extensively analyzed using dynamical systems theory as well as statistical, numerical, and machine learning methods. Mathematical and computational challenges anticipated in this research will offer opportunities to develop innovative techniques that advance the field of applied non-autonomous complex differential equations as well as optimal control theory. This project will also broaden the application of differential equation modeling to a machine learning framework. The results, including optimal treatment protocols, are intended help to inform evidence-based guidelines for managing, preventing, and curing HIV infection via early ARTs and NBPTs, thereby enhancing the quality of life for HIV infected patients. In addition, this project will provide extensive interdisciplinary research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, data-driven methods are becoming de rigueur nowadays, driving the need for increasingly sophisticated algorithms that find subtle statistical patterns in massive amount of data. This trend however is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, modern statistical learning methods help researchers in various fields to discover unexpected patterns from data and to make better decisions impacting everyday life. On the other hand, the rapid growth in the size and scope of data sets as well as the complexity of the methods used has made statistical models less transparent. Employing the derived models without a proper understanding of their validity can lead to many false discoveries, incorrect predictions and massive costs. For example, suppose the medical records of patients are used to develop a model for providing personalized risk score for a chronic disease. A high-risk score can trigger an intervention, such as incentive for healthy behavior, additional tests, and medical follow-ups which are all costly. This raises the concern about the validity of the outcomes retuned by this model. Should one interpret them at an average level or an individual level? Are the model predictions biased and, if so, how much? The overarching goal of this project is to develop novel foundational perspectives on the emerging inferential and computational challenges in statistics and data science. In addition, the PI plans to develop software packages to implement the proposed methods and make them publicly available. The proposed work will benefit a broad range of researchers from various areas ranging from bioinformatics and machine learning to finance and engineering. The PI will also integrate components from this project into an advanced graduate class and use selected results to motivate undergraduate students to pursue careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). <br/><br/>This project aims at developing statistical methods that are 1) scalable and 2) valid in the sense that in addition point estimation, they also quantify the statistical uncertainty that is intrinsic in the estimation and predications. These issues are among the central topics in modern statistics and it is imperative to develop solid theory and powerful methodology to address them. This project focuses on three interrelated prongs that develop fundamental insights for these ubiquitous challenges: (1) Uncertainty assessment and high-dimensional inference: the PI will develop a flexible framework for general hypothesis testing problems in high-dimensional setting using the so-called debiasing approach, and further study inference for high-dimensional models with adaptively collected samples, such as time series; (2) Online hypotheses testing: the PI will formulate the decentralized false discovery rate (FDR) control where the number of hypotheses to be tested is unknown (possibly infinite) and the decision maker should take an action on each before the next p-value is received; and (3) Optimal iterative estimation for non-linear decision regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The students can apply to the REU program by ranking their favorite projects and recruitment will consider the applicant's skills and likelihood of having a successful experience as well as attracting students from traditionally underrepresented population groups, including women, African American and Hispanic/Latino students. The participating students will spend a total of 10 summer weeks at Harvey Mudd College (a member of the 5 Claremont Colleges that also include Claremont McKenna, Pomona, Pitzer and Scripps) and will work on their research projects with an experienced faculty member. They will be supported by state-of-the-art infrastructure such as computing facilities, libraries and laboratories. Students will also engage with their peers in a series of data science and professional skill workshops. Social events and educational field trips round out the program. Domain-specific research using data science methods and tools provide the students with important skills that prepare them for graduate studies and are useful for analyzing and solving problems in many disciplines and environments. The professional skill modules, including research ethics, time management and scholarly publishing, will complement and enrich the technical training and further equip students with competencies needed to become well-rounded, successful researchers. As computational capacity continues to expand at a rapid pace, there is an increased need for data science literacy among all scientists and engineers. Exposing the students to relevant concepts and tools in data science through this REU program is aimed at encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM-related fields and helping fill the persistent skill and labor gap in the U.S. by producing graduates who can have an impact on science and technology in the public and private sectors. <br/><br/>The research projects that are part of the Harvey Mudd College REU program in Data Science in Life Sciences, Environmental Science and Engineering address new and open problems in different STEM disciplines using computational, mathematical and statistical methods and tools. The participating faculty mentors maintain active research activities in these tracks that offer data and hypothesis-rich environments for exploration and in-depth analysis. Example projects include the analysis of flow cytometry data, modeling of epidemiological and public health data such as surgical cataract coverage in developing countries, spatial data modeling and analysis for health risk assessments related to unconventional oil and gas development, testing hybrid mathematical models in atmospheric chemistry, and developing predictive models for sports coaching such as real-time coaching recommendations based on play-by-play basketball data. These projects involve high-dimensional data analytics and use different techniques to extract insights such as simulated data to validate mathematical models of effective health intervention coverage, multivariate spatial regression and Kriging, time series analysis of cloud-chamber data on air pollution models, and algebraic analysis of partially ranked data coupled with predictive techniques used in machine learning to predict player performance. In addition, students will also receive hands-on training in R, Python, MATLAB, become well versed in Linux command line processing, batch scripting, data movement, use of XSEDE supercomputers, and version control. They will be exposed to big data environments such as Hadoop and Spark, learn to use relational databases and write SQL and PostgreSQL queries, and work with ESRI's ArcGIS to model high-resolution spatial data. While the technical training and participation in real research processes is the main component of the REU program, necessary soft skills for successfully developing and running research programs are taught as well.

Scientists in a variety of disciplines today have unprecedented access to massive spatial and temporal databases comprising high resolution remote sensed measurements. Statistical modeling and analysis for such data often entail reckoning with spatial associations and variations at multiple levels while attempting to recognize underlying patterns and potentially complex relationships among the scientific variables. Traditional statistical hypothesis testing is no longer adequate for these inferential objectives and statisticians are increasingly turning to multi-level or hierarchical modeling structures for analyzing complex spatial-temporal data. However, there continue to remain substantial computational bottlenecks as scientists encounter the data deluge in remote-sensed data that demand specialized ""BIG DATA"" technologies. The PIs will address these problems by developing probabilistic machine learning tools for spatial-temporal BIG DATA within the context of scientific advancements in forest structure, topography, and weather-related events (e.g., storms) that can have far-reaching public health, economic, environmental, and security implications. Several innovations in statistical and computational methods and related software development are envisioned. The proposed data products will offer quantification of forest damage/change and landslide risk assessment for Puerto Rico following hurricanes Irma and Maria. Key educational components include dissemination of proposed technologies across the scientific communities including data scientists, engineers, foresters, ecologists, and climate scientists. The PIs plan to train the next generation of data scientists through dissemination efforts for undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields.           <br/><br/>The PIs will develop a statistical framework for executing elaborate case studies and data analysis on high-dimensional remotely sensed data, where ""high dimension"" alludes to one or all of a massive number of (i) spatial locations; (ii) time points; and (iii) responses or outcomes. The PIs will introduce massively scalable multivariate spatial process models within a rich Bayesian hierarchical framework to obtain fully model-based inference for the underlying data generating process. Innovative statistical methodologies are proposed to implement hierarchical models at scales involving tens of millions of spatial locations, thousands of time points and possibly hundreds of remote-sensed variables. The massive scalability of these models will be achieved through sparsity-inducing spatial-temporal processes and other graphical models, matrix-variate low-rank models, conjugate Bayesian distribution theory, and meta-learning paradigms using approximations of a collection of posterior distributions. Theoretical results that enhance current methods will be explored as will be several proposed case studies at hitherto unprecedented scales. The PIs will develop a full suite of spatial models in a wide variety of experiments involving massive data sets. Since massive data sets are where complex relationships can be detected effectively, the proposed methods are well-suited for modeling complex scientific phenomena. Key substantive inference and statistical quantification will be offered for forest damage/change and landslide risk assessment for Puerto Rico following hurricanes Irma and Maria.

The two main motivating applications for this project are to plasma physics and gravitational waves.

Consequently, modeling spatiotemporal data with flexible statistical models has become an enormously active area of research over the last decade in many disciplines including the environmental sciences, health sciences and oceanography, among others. In all these applications, researchers require efficient data modeling tools that can adapt to the complexity and size of modern spatiotemporal data, empowering them to quickly fit a variety of scientific models that explain the intricate nature of associations. This research project develops a new class of distributed Bayesian statistical algorithms, the Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC), that enables efficient modeling of massive spatiotemporal data on an unprecedented scale. While the motivation of the PIs comes primarily from complex modeling and uncertainty quantification of massive spatiotemporal data, the proposed algorithm is general enough to set important footprints in the related literature of machine learning and computer experiments. The overarching goal also includes the development of software toolkits to better serve practitioners in related disciplines. <br/><br/>There has been an explosion in the size, complexity, and availability of spatiotemporally indexed data. This event has outpaced the development in Bayesian statistical methodology in that the fitting of state-of-the-art methods based on stochastic processes for analyzing spatiotemporal point referenced and point process data is prohibitively slow unless restrictive assumptions are imposed. The main problem is that the Monte Carlo (MC) computations in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for fitting these models scale poorly with the size of the data. Solving this problem, the PIs develop a general framework, called Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC), for scaling MC computations in the stochastic process-based modeling of massive space-time data using a divide-and-conquer technique. AMC has three stages that involve dividing the data into smaller subsets, obtaining posterior samples of the unknown parameters and latent variables across all the subsets using MCMC, and combining the MCMC samples from all the subsets. AMC is tuned to boost the scalability of any state-of-the-art model based on a stochastic process using a divide-and-conquer technique. Computationally, the main innovations include the development of general division and combination schemes for data with diverse spatiotemporal structures. Theoretically, the project provides bounds on the number of subsets such that the posterior distribution estimated using AMC provides a near optimal approximation of the full data posterior distribution in terms of decay of the posterior risks and contraction rates. Conceptually, AMC provides a natural extension of the existing results for combination using the barycenter of subset posterior distributions in parametric models to non-parametric models with complex spatiotemporal structures. The most appealing features of AMC are that it exploits parallel computer architecture for efficient and flexible modeling of massive spatiotemporal data and it provides posterior inference and uncertainty estimates with theoretical guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nonlinear nature of deformations makes these objects extremely powerful while at the same time making them challenging to estimate and theoretically explore. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The theoretical properties of estimated deformations for generating nonparametric and semiparametric statistical estimates are analyzed through a surprising connection with Stein's method. In addition, the investigator focuses on recent results found in the theory of optimal transport, which has the potential to provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for deformable templates. The computational aspects of estimated deformations will utilize a new Euler-Lagrange characterization of a penalized maximum likelihood estimate, which can significantly relieve the typical computational burden associated with estimation. One consequence will be to make these methods available for widespread use by statistical practitioners in a broad range of problems: nonparametric and semiparametric density estimation, estimating gravitational lensing in cosmology and posterior sampling techniques, to name a few. Another intellectual merit of this proposal are the scientific ramifications of two new proposed deformation estimates of weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): a wavelet/Slepian quadratic estimator and a new Bayesian lensing estimator. Gravitational lensing studies have become one of the most successful tools for probing the nature of dark matter. The precise estimation of lensing is important for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, understanding cosmic structure, constraining cosmological parameters and detecting gravity waves. The investigator proposes to uses wavelets and Slepian multi-tapers to adapt the quadratic estimate to local foreground contaminants and sky cuts, which are ubiquitous features in most modern cosmological surveys. The investigator proposes a new Bayesian estimator which has the potential to dramatically change the way gravitational lensing studies are done and how they are integrated within other astronomical surveys.<br/><br/>Smooth invertible transformations, or deformations, are fast becoming important tools in modern data analysis.  They have been used with spectacular success in the field of computational anatomy where time varying vector field flows which generate deformations are used to statistically analyze medical fMRI images and quantify abnormal morphological structure. In cosmology, deformations are used to model gravitational distortions of the cosmic microwave background from dark matter density fluctuations, and have resulted in a deeper understanding of cosmic structure. Even though these important tools are becoming integrated in modern scientific methods, the statistical properties of estimated deformations have been largely unexplored. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The tools resulting from this project will be useful, not only in statistics, but also in other branches of science and technology ranging from genetics to machine learning. In the field of physics, for example, the potential scientific progress resulting from gravitational lensing estimation could a have broad impact on scientific understanding and the future of scientific research. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly important to train graduate and undergraduate students with the tools necessary to successfully navigate interdisciplinary work, and who are prepared for independent research. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal will foster a culture of collaboration that will reach the fundamentals of statistical education and will deepen ties with statistics and other physical sciences. In addition, through the integration of research and education, the proposal will teach both graduate and undergraduate students research skills. The result will be two fold. First, it will train graduate students to become creative independent researchers who can contribute within an academic environment. Second, it will educate undergraduates to navigate a work environment which values creative independent investigation."

Knowledge of molecular crystal structures is essential in pharmaceuticals and many other areas of chemistry.  Different crystal packing motifs (""polymorphs"") of the same molecule can exhibit vastly different properties, and occurrences of undesirable polymorphs have caused major drug recalls and other serious problems for patients and pharmaceutical manufacturers.  NMR spectroscopy is increasingly used to determine crystal structures and characterize different polymorphs.  Translating the set of peaks present in an NMR spectrum into a three-dimensional crystal structure frequently involves trial-and-error computational modeling of potential structures to identify the structure whose predicted NMR spectrum best matches the experimentally observed one.  This project develops computational tools to circumvent this trial-and-error process and enable direct crystal structure refinement which can automatically solve for the crystal structure that produces the experimentally observed NMR spectrum.  These new tools will significantly improve the utility of NMR for solving crystal structures.  <br/><br/>Achieving these goals requires research advances in three areas. First, new computationally practical electronic structure methods for modeling the non-covalent interactions that govern crystal packing are being developed to enable identification of good initial crystal structures.  Second, because accurate predictions of the NMR chemical shifts for a given structure are essential to discriminating between correct and incorrect structural assignments when comparing predicted and observed spectra, models which predict NMR chemical shifts more reliably than widely used existing techniques are being developed.  Third, to enable direct NMR-driven crystal structure refinement, machine learning models that reproduce how changes in molecular conformation and crystal packing impact the chemical shifts are being developed.  Success will lead to greater ability to engineer molecular crystals with desired properties.  In addition, this award is supporting outreach activities at a local elementary school and production of online tools to educate new users about computational chemistry approaches."

However, most variable astronomical sources are aperiodic, showing erratic and irregular changes.  They remain poorly studied in comparison to periodic sources, even though they can play a key role in our understanding of complex dynamic physical environments, from stars, to gas and dust flows, to galaxies.  This work studies aperiodic variability using the data from two NSF-supported projects, the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS), and the newly begun Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).  This is the first large-scale systematic study of these phenomena, and it will be the definitive study, well into the next decade.  It is an excellent case study for data-intensive science, applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to real data.  It will expose students to cutting-edge data science, and its products will contribute to projects that will train the next generation in how to handle big astronomical data.<br/><br/>Even though the majority of variable sources are aperiodic, they are poorly understood, and for well-known examples like quasars and young stellar objects many fundamental questions remain about the physical mechanisms behind their optical variability.  New sky surveys are enabling systematic studies of variability and discovering many new phenomena, including sub-parsec separated quasar binaries, multi-year long flares attributable to microlensing of explosive activity in the accretion disk, and changing-state sources indicative of variable accretion rates.  These extreme behaviors should be easily discoverable with modern robust statistical methods.  This work will create generative data-derived models with novel non-parametric discriminating features from CRTS data, and use the models to predict the future behavior of aperiodic sources, which can then be monitored in real-time using ZTF and other synoptic facilities.  Prior work focused on robust statistical characterization and identifying extreme variable classes.  This will be extended to more general aperiodic sources and more sophisticated non-parametric generative models.  The unprecedented sky coverage of ZTF joins with the unequalled archival coverage of CRTS to make this the definitive study.  In keeping with the CRTS Open Data and ZTF alert policies, all transitioning objects identified will be released to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In modern complex and large datasets, these methods are especially crucial as they enable the detection of important trends and patterns in the data that may be missed by traditional parametric statistical techniques. However there exist many unresolved issues concerning the theory, methodology and application of nonparametric methods in modern data problems. A systematic study of these issues will be undertaken in this project which will result in (a) an improved understanding (in terms of accuracy and uncertainty quantification) of many existing methods, and (b) novel methods and computational algorithms that will be useful to applied practitioners in the scientific areas mentioned above. Most of the proposed projects are collaborative and involve researchers from a diverse set of universities. The project also contains a well-developed plan of educational activities which will have a major impact on the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students at UC Berkeley in statistical research.

The research component of the program uses electron microscopy to understand how complex nanostructures form. Many properties of nanoscale materials are determined by structural imperfections that appear during the growth process and go on to affect the material's final structure. For example, adding a metallic coating to straight silver-gold alloy nanowires can cause the wires to transition to a double helix morphology. Before nanostructures such as these can be widely used in technological applications, there is a need to understand how the helical structure originates. Using advanced electron microscopy, this program will combine extremely detailed and high resolution studies in three-dimensions with high-throughput imaging to obtain a complete picture as to how the helical nanowires grow and twist. This research will advance the fundamental understanding of the processes that determine how complicated nanostructures can be chemically synthesized for future technological applications. The educational component of this program aims to provide access to academic extra-curriculars for high school students in severely underserved areas. Students in many areas in Oakland and Richmond face poverty, hunger, violence and racial discrimination. Social and economic hurdles often prohibit these students' participation in traditional summer extracurricular activities, which can increase the academic achievement gap in this population. Working with local high school teachers, this program will develop and implement a flexible and adaptable summer research experience for these and other students affected by inequitable systems. This program will use imaging and visualization as tools to convey scientific knowledge and excite the students about careers in science. It also aims to develop mentorship networks to help students attain their goals in the college and job market.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>The research portion of this program will use electron microscopy to determine the structural origin of chirality in core-shell nanowires. Nanoscale three-dimensional characterization will be used to study the morphology of the nanowires as they transition from straight to twisted structures during addition of the shell. By varying the shell thickness and atomic species, the role that lattice mismatch plays in the structural transformation from straight to helical in these wires will be determined. Atomic resolution electron tomography will be used to measure the position of defects and the strain distribution in these materials to determine how these structural features are related to the helical structure that these materials adopt. A high-throughput electron microscopy workflow using a machine learning approach will be developed to measure structural heterogeneity in many populations of the straight and twisted nanowires. The comprehensive understanding of the development of the helical morphology demonstrated by the core-shell nanowires under study will relate the presence of microstructural features (defect, strain, grain boundaries) to the overall morphology of the nanowires. This in turn will enable the rational design of functional materials based on this system, application in optoelectronic, nanomechanical, biomimetic or catalytic applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an integral component of cartilage, where it plays a biomechanical role in promoting healthy joint function. Further, since it can be obtained in large quantities, and can be chemically modified, it has become widely studied for biomedical and biomaterial applications. These biological and technological roles rely on hyaluronic acid?s physical features: it is a long, linear polymer that is highly charged and water soluble, and it has a variety of interactions, both with salt ions and with biomolecular binding partners, that modify its structure and behavior. However, compared to other biopolymers (such as DNA or cytoskeletal components), the basic physical behavior of hyaluronic acid has not been extensively studied.<br/>The main goal of the present project is to perform precision measurements of the physical behavior of hyaluronic acid, and its modification by ions and other molecules. The researchers will carry out such experiments using modern biophysical approaches, and interpret them using advanced theoretical methods. Experiments will be focused on two areas: first, researchers will quantify electrostatic effects of salt on hyaluronic acid behavior, and particularly pursue understanding of physiologically-relevant mixed-salt conditions on molecular shape. Second, researchers will investigate the hypothesis that dramatic shape-changes can be induced in hyaluronic acid upon binding to specific biomolecular partners. <br/>Overall, the scientific work in this project will result in direct, quantitative estimates of the role of salt and biomolecular-binding in affecting hyaluronic acid behavior; in turn, this will lead to better understanding of the molecule?s various biological roles, and will permit rational engineering of hyaluronic acid in biomaterials environments. These scientific impacts are complemented by a range of other benefits, notably including a major effort to broaden graduate-student training through an exchange program with a German university, focused on teaching modern computational methods to bioengineers and biophysicists. Other benefits will accrue from collaboration with a national lab, and enhancing STEM human resources through undergraduate student training.<br/>?<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Hyaluronic acid, HA, is a long, linear, negatively-charged polysaccharide with moderate conformational flexibility. It plays broad biological roles, particularly in defining the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of extracellular spaces. HA?s properties have also led to broad investigation of its use as a synthetic biomaterial, e.g. forming injectables or cell/tissue growth substrates. The polymeric properties of HA underlie these biological and biotechnological roles, but are understudied. The overarching goal of this proposal is to fill that gap in knowledge by performing high-resolution physical measurements, supported by advanced theoretical interpretation methods, of ion- and ligand-induced HA conformational behaviors. The researchers will apply a unique single-molecule mechanics instrument to carry out precision measurements of HA?s solution-mediated conformational and mechanical properties. Specific goals include 1) exploiting machine-learning methods to improve instrument capabilities in screening biomolecular elasticity; 2) validating and exploring a recent finding that HA conformation in mixed-ionic conditions is dominated by an ?ion jacket? that screens the effect of bulk salt concentration; and 3) studying the effects of specific biological ligands on HA conformation, with a focus on ligands posited to induce a helix/coil transition in the chain, and those that cause global chain swelling. Experimental results will be interpreted with reference to analytical theories of solution electrostatics and polymer bottle-brush behavior, as well as coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The computational tools used include data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and data analytics techniques.  Predictive theoretical models and quantum-based methods are developed that are applicable to water reuse applications. With these, the chemical reaction rates for water reuse are calculated. The models are then validated and improved through targeted experiments. This approach advances the basic scientific understanding of reaction dynamics in molecular radicals. This project allows a seamless connection of both theory and experiment to address the efficiency and reaction pathways of radical-organics interactions associated with water purification processes. Professors Wong and Liu engage students at all levels in their research, including community college students. A total of three Hispanic-Serving Institutions are involved in this project. The investigators also reach out to K-12 students and their teachers to promote understanding of the role of computing in environmental science and engineering.  By examining wastewater treatments, this project promotes human health and sustainability efforts in industry. <br/><br/>This project addresses aquatic reaction kinetics for advanced water treatment and reuse. The combined multidisciplinary approach leads to a systematic understanding of how molecular structure influences thermodynamics and kinetics in complex aqueous environments. This is a significant scientific and technical challenge and critical to providing a guided, rational path for improving water reuse. Furthermore, this project establishes a computational screening effort to identify fundamental physicochemical characteristics that affect aqueous chemical kinetics. Both density functional theory (DFT) and rigorous many-body wave function CCSD(T)-F12 methods are used. The project also establishes a series of guided kinetics and characterization efforts that closely follow the computational screening efforts, including numerical sensitivity analyses. These calculations provide a systematic understanding of electronic structure of organic molecules in aqueous environments. The experiments in turn guide the computational studies and afford the capability to understand the detailed, complex contributions that modulate the reaction dynamics in these aqueous systems. The fundamental knowledge generated by this work has broad societal impact, particularly for regions and industries that critically rely on water treatment and reuse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fibers are active and release signaling molecules that profoundly affect the brain. However, individual fibers do not have well-defined destinations and appear to be randomly oriented within brain tissue, frequently changing their direction. This property makes them very different from point-to-point nerve connections. Because of the unpredictability of individual fiber trajectories, brain research to date has focused on overall fiber ""densities."" These densities vary across brain regions and have been associated with normal and altered functions of the brain. This research project aims to reveal how local, random-like decisions by individual fibers lead to specific fiber densities in brain regions. The research also intends to determine whether the behavior of the fibers has remained fundamentally the same in the last 250 million years of vertebrate evolution. This conceptually-novel, interdisciplinary approach brings together recent developments in high-resolution microscopy, automated image analysis (including machine learning), and stochastic processes. The causal models developed in the project are expected to provide essential tools for the prediction of fiber densities from the dynamics of single fibers and will lay a theoretical foundation for fiber density manipulations in fundamental and applied neuroscience. The project's data and analyses will be used in a newly created interdisciplinary laboratory course and will also strengthen an undergraduate training program in bio-image informatics. The project naturally brings together neurobiology, engineering, and mathematics; this and its visual appeal make it well-suited for planned STEM-oriented presentations for K-12 students, as well as for public talks. Since serotonergic fibers present unique computational challenges, the project will contribute to the development of image analysis algorithms. The project will also build a rigorous theoretical foundation for the structure of ""diffuse"" neurotransmission that is affected in several mental disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder.<br/><br/>Virtually all neural processes in vertebrate brains take place in a dense matrix of fibers that release serotonin, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters. This ancient system originates in the brainstem and is known as the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS). Since ARAS fibers do not form well-defined projections and have extremely meandering trajectories, their current descriptions fall outside the scope of connectomics projects and are based on observed fiber ""densities."" This interdisciplinary project seeks to reconstruct the fundamental self-organizing process that builds and supports the ARAS in the brain. In a radical departure from current descriptive approaches, it hypothesizes that the behavior of single serotonergic fibers can be described by a three-dimensional stochastic process, which determines the resultant fiber density (as an emergent phenomenon). Vertebrate brains, spanning some 250 million years of evolution, will be used to elucidate this process. Single ARAS fibers will be visualized with immunohistochemistry (including tissue expansion) and imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Long fiber trajectories in mice will be visualized using tissue-clearing techniques and whole-brain imaging with light-sheet microscopy. An image analysis algorithm will be developed to automatically detect and trace individual fiber trajectories in the 3D-space. The trajectories will be used to build an optimal stochastic model, by taking advantage of advanced computational methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As is often the case, the literature on these topics is overwhelmingly application-specific.  Contributing theory and more principled methodology can help build a foundation that enables the research community to move forward with a common, more rigorous (mathematical) language and a deeper understanding of the problem itself and its ramifications.  A particular focus will be on understanding how robust state-of-the-art methods are to gross errors in the input (ubiquitous in applications) and, for some tasks, on developing new methods that are more robust than existing ones.<br/><br/>The problem of graph embedding is a fundamental problem at the crossroads of a number of research areas including multivariate analysis and visualization in statistics, machine learning, metric geometry, robotics, and more.  The literature on the topic is vast, and yet lacks crucial elements of theory, in particular in regards to the stability to noise and robustness to outliers.  Although some robust methods are available, there is potential for improvement by leveraging existing research on the problem of robust matrix completion.  At an even more fundamental level, there is the problem of characterizing which graphs are uniquely embeddable.  This is studied in the rigidity theory literature.  The problem is largely solved and reduces to the existence of a certain matrix, called stress matrix, that includes the coordinate vectors defined by an embedding of the graph (when one exists) in its null space, and has maximum rank with that property.  However, this condition is qualitative, rather than quantitative, in that the rank is numerically unstable.

Part of this research project focuses on the development of new flexible statistical methods to perform accurate prediction and inference in the presence of incomplete and missing data. Here, the data could be high-dimensional as well as functional, where each data value can be a curve. In another part of this research project, the PI considers the development of new efficient computer-intensive methods to deal with Big-data scenarios, where the data size may be too large to invoke classical approaches. Big-data has been one of the current research frontiers in recent years and there has been a growing interest in  Big-data-driven decision-making procedures in both academia and the industry.  There are still many computational and theoretical challenges in this area that require new methodologies. The PI's new approaches will solve a number of important statistical problems at the intersection of machine learning and statistical inference.<br/><br/>The research deals with three broad classes of problems related to prediction and inference in some nonstandard setups. These include the problem of functional classification when the covariate curves may be unobservable on some subsets of their domain. However, unlike some of the earlier results in the literature, the PI's approach does not impose any missing-at-random (MAR) type assumptions on the mechanisms that cause the absence or censoring of information. The approach allows for incomplete covariate to appear in the new unclassified curves as well as in the data. Given the observed covariate fragments, the aim is to construct strongly consistent nonparametric classifiers based on local-averaging methods. The second class of problems deals with uniform asymptotics for kernel regression estimators in the presence of missing response variables. This is generally acknowledged to be a difficult problem. The limiting distribution of the maximal deviation of such estimators can be used to construct asymptotically correct uniform confidence bands, or to perform goodness-of-fit tests, for an unknown regression function. Here, the PI will consider both MAR and non-ignorable missing response assumptions. The third set of problems focuses on the development of new weighted bootstrap methods for Big-data scenarios. The PI's approach aims at reducing the computational burden associated with the repeated sampling of Big-data, while still retaining the benefits of bootstrap methodology. The developed methods will be used to better approximate the sampling distribution of kernel and deconvolution density estimators, as well as their important functionals (such as sup- and Lp-norms), in the Big-data scenario.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project provides a series of iterative algorithmic frameworks for interactive multiple testing, which blend exploratory and confirmatory analyses. The frameworks are adaptive in an unusually strong sense: at each step of the procedure, the algorithm reveals more data to the analyst who makes data-driven decisions that guide the procedure.<br/><br/>The starting point of this project is the PI's recent work on the AdaPT and STAR algorithms, which give flexible and powerful frameworks for controlling the FDR while exploiting side information (AdaPT) or enforcing constraints on the rejection set (STAR). Given predictor for each p-value, AdaPT lets analysts interactively estimate Bayes-optimal p-value weights from the data using any machine learning method, while provably controlling finite-sample FDR. The STAR likewise allows for generic interactive modeling while also guaranteeing that the rejection set satisfies natural structural constraints such as hierarchy principles in regression. Both methods guarantee FDR control by means of optional stopping arguments, giving near-total flexibility to the analyst to adaptively model the data. The PI will work on four projects that continue this research program by developing new interactive methods and applying AdaPT to current scientific problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the field of cancer genomics, thousands of measurements can be obtained with the objective of discovering molecular signatures that characterize biological processes. However, advances in this area have been limited due to major computational challenges involved in identifying the structures that are present in both healthy and cancerous cells. This project aims to develop new topological methods to detect hidden dependencies within and across different types of data obtained from breast cancer patients. The project will intensively train three graduate students each year in these novel methods and expand the undergraduate and graduate curricula in data analysis and applied topology. Results and materials will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community through publications in open access and standard journals, conference presentations, and open source software. Results will be also shared with the public, including teachers and students in grades 10th to 12th, through training courses and art exhibits. <br/><br/>Genomic technologies have revolutionized the field of genetics over the past decade, providing new methods for identifying thousands of genetic/molecular signals associated to specific phenotypes. Among these methods, Genome Wide Association Studies have accelerated the identification of specific genetic elements by testing thousands of genetic loci simultaneously. These approaches, however, are less useful for identifying co-occurrences of and interactions among genetic elements, conditions that appear to be ubiquitous in living organisms. To address this gap, the PIs will develop new mathematical methods to enable the identification of interactions among genetic elements in cancer, thereby testing the hypothesis that many cancer phenotypes are regulated by co-occurring genetic events. Using the combined tools of modern topological and data analyses, including machine learning techniques, the research team will identify such co-occurrences by: analyzing generators of homology groups, implementing a computational data-driven theory of fiber bundles, and developing new models of cancer evolution using Khovanov-type categorification methods. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop new computational tools in time series analysis that help identify hidden interdependencies of data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Naturally, any use of human genomic data raises grave privacy concerns. This is because the power to query multiple genomic databases with seemingly innocuous questions such as ""Do you contain any genome that has mutation X?"" is enough to determine whether an individual's genome is present in the databases. Such re-identification attacks have raised a germane question: can one implement privacy protection for genomic data so that meaningful data analysis remains possible, but attacks such as these become impossible? The main idea of this project is to achieve this goal by making and exploiting statistical assumptions about the data, such that if the assumptions are false, data analysis will suffer but privacy will not. The project will also generate curricular material for a graduate class at the intersection of data privacy, machine learning, and genomics.<br/><br/>The project considers three major research questions on preserving privacy in the context of genomic data. The notion of privacy used is differential privacy, which provably protects against re-identification attacks, and has found large-scale adoption in both academia and industry. The first research question is the estimation of allele frequencies, and of linkage disequilibrium, while preserving individual privacy. Given a set of human genomes, the objective of allele frequency estimation is to estimate the frequency of the different mutations across various locations in the chromosome. Linkage disequilibrium is the deviation from independence for pairs of alleles. The second question is haplotype sampling. Haplotypes correspond to sets of genetic variations (typically extending over multiple genes), that tend to be inherited together.  In haplotype sampling, the objective is to generate synthetic haplotypes given a data set of human genomes, while respecting biology behind these genetic variations. Finally, the project aims to estimate pathogenic variants of breast cancer genes. Variants of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes are known to be pathogenic for breast cancer. However, a lot of the variants are still not classified as pathogenic / non-pathogenic and are VUSs - Variants of Unknown Significance. The objective is to develop a privacy-preserving system to gather statistics about the VUSs from individually sequenced genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims to develop approximate methods backed by an optimality theory and/or performance guarantees.  The work is expected to provide new theoretical insights into current problems in specific application domains such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging and quantitative genetics.<br/><br/>The project will bring ideas from classical decision theory to compressed sensing and robust linear modeling, rigorously solving nonconvex optimization problems and obtaining reconstruction performance rigorously better than traditional convex optimization methods.

The project will also study theoretically the statistical performance of some methods for deterministic approximate inference popular in machine learning, but for which little attention has been given to properties such as consistency, asymptotic normality and efficiency.  The study will begin with concrete examples in the realm of generalized linear mixed models, from a frequentist perspective, and seek to establish first-of-kind results for asymptotic efficiency of Expectation Propagation.

In the present day the matter is very strongly clustered into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and even larger structures. This evolution is governed by gravity and by additional processes such as formation of stars in galaxies. There is enormous amount of information about the universe origins, content, and future evolution hidden in the galaxy distribution.  This information is difficult to access in the present-day form because it has been scrambled by gravity and other processes. The goal of this project is to use simulations to reconstruct the initial conditions of our universe. When these are evolved in time with known laws of physics, they give rise to our visible universe. Ultimately this will allow a movie to made of our universe starting from the initial smooth distribution and ending in images of actual galaxies such as the Hubble Deep Field. A major benefit of this method is that information about our universe can be simply extracted from the initial conditions.  More broadly, an aim of this project is to impact other communities where similar problems arise such as machine learning via the methods and tools developed   <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop and apply a new set of theoretical and computational instruments, including new statistical methods, algorithms, and computational implementations, to optimally reconstruct the initial condition of our universe from the spatial distribution of galaxies. Galaxies are a primary probe of the large scale structure of the universe that are or will be observed by surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), EUCLID and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). This project will extend a hierarchical probabilistic generative model developed by the PI's team to the modelling of galaxies. The framework attempts to solve an exact probabilistic model for the initial conditions that is conditioned on the data with a process that combines elements of numerical optimization in high dimensions and analytic marginalization to find the best solution and their covariance matrix. The proposed research will apply this method to galaxy redshift catalogs and their surrounding dark matter information inferred from weak lensing. The method will be developed using realistic simulations of both dark matter and of galaxies populated in the dark matter and hydro simulations, before being applied to real data.  This research will explore best methods to achieve fast convergence in the search for local and global minimum and aims to have an impact more broadly to research areas (e.g. neural networks) outside astronomy in the tools developed for non-convex optimization in very high dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include networks or age-at-death distributions for which common algebraic operations such as sums or differences are not defined. In many instances such data objects may also be repeatedly observed over time, and the quantification of their time dynamics is then of great interest. For example, one might be interested to determine whether sudden changes occur and where these are located in time.  Statistical methodology will be developed that addresses these data analytic needs, along with theory and efficient computational implementations. This new methodology is expected to lead to substantial new insights. For example, it will be possible to quantify phenomena such as changes in temperature, mortality or income distributions over calendar years, or changes in brain connectivity networks as a function of age, which will aid in distinguishing normal and pathological brain aging. The new methodology will also make it possible to detect differences between groups of complex data, for example between the mortality distribution of countries, including the identification of clusters. The project also provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The focus of this research is the development of statistical methods and theory for random objects, i.e., metric space valued random variables, including object-valued functional and longitudinal data. Due to the lack of Euclidean structure, existing methods from high-dimensional and functional data analysis are generally not applicable for metric-space valued random objects. This motivates the development of novel approaches that address the challenge of a lack of Euclidean structure.  Major lines of inquiry will be regression and change-point models for random objects on one hand and methods for trajectories of random objects including complex functional data on the other. New regression and change-point models to be studied include distributions as predictors; regression models for point processes; inference and single index modeling for Frechet regression; and change-point analysis for sequences of object data under various scenarios. For object-valued functional data, an emphasis will be the development of time warping models for random objects and of models for longitudinal random objects in various spaces, including the case where the data are only sparsely and irregularly observed in time. Tools and theory for principled statistical analysis of random objects to be developed will rely on empirical process theory for M estimators in metric spaces, U statistics and related approaches. These developments will lead to the creation of a toolbox suitable for data analysis of object data and associated freely available software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New experimental and theoretical tools are needed to develop a predictive understanding of the regulatory processes that control the outputs of these complex cellular networks. Current approaches focus on correlations between the components of the system (such as genetic composition, expression levels, metabolite concentrations), however such correlations alone are usually insufficient to develop strategies for robust control of the state and function of diverse microbial communities. In this project the PI will use multiscale approach that combines theoretical predictions with precision experimental tests to quantitatively understand how individual and groups of cells reach decisions to coordinate global behavior within microbial ecosystems. Tackling modern societal challenges related to health, agriculture, and the environment will benefit from a predictive understanding of how multiple components of a network work together, particularly for complex networks involving many densely connected components. To inspire the next generation of scientists to take up problems on the physics of systems and complexity, the PI has partnered with a local science non-profit to design and implement hands-on learning activities related to the biophysics of signal exchange. Students will gain an intuitive understanding of the physical principles that govern cellular networks, including insight into how network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals within a population. Themes of this research will also appear in an undergraduate general education course focused on training undergraduates from diverse background, including non-science majors, in essential quantitative skills intrinsic to the physical sciences.<br/><br/>The PI will examine the exchange of variant quorum sensing signals within diverse microbial networks to understand how signaling interactions between individual strains give rise to emergent properties of the network. An artificial neural network model predicts the impact of crosstalk between cell types on system-level signaling states. The stability of these signal-driven regulatory states will be examined in both models and experiments to gauge the potential to direct the outputs of multispecies networks through perturbations of species composition or signal exchange pathways. This combination of theory and experiment illuminates how systems-level behaviors such as robustness emerge from the collective action of multiple cell types working together.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the electron flow through the semiconductor silicon can be turned on or off, or modulated like a valve, and these behaviors are the basis behind transistors, computer processors, and all electronic communication.  To maintain continued progress in electronics technology, the underlying components and materials must be continuously scaled down in size.  However, this progress is now stymied by the fact that critical dimensions are approaching ""quantum"" sizes where the position of even a single stray atom or molecule plays a measurable role in performance, and the flow of electrons is impeded by atom-size impurities and even by their own tiny weight.  New materials hold the key to circumventing many of these problems, but new materials are often difficult to understand and therefore apply, due to their complex nature.  This project synthesizes new electronic materials using one of the most advanced laboratory technologies available-the controlled manipulation of single atoms and molecules to build up from scratch entirely new materials that can guide electrons in ways not possible with existing materials.  These new materials are built one atom at a time as a means to test how new fundamental physics can be applied to electronic technologies, such as making electrons move as if they have no weight, and making electron avoid obstacles so that their flow through electronic devices is unimpeded.  The information learned from these studies feeds back into synthesizing larger versions of the same materials in bulk.  In the process of conducting the calculations and experiments of this project, Ph.D. students receive education and training in the critical fields of nanotechnology and nanomaterials, and undergraduate students receive exposure to state-of-the-art research.  The research team teaches courses into which current research in nanoscale science and technology is interwoven, manages a program that hosts and mentors visiting students from underrepresented-minority-serving community colleges in 10-week lab research internships, and actively makes available nanoscience educational tools and multimedia for the general public. <br/><br/>Technical abstract.  <br/>This project applies atomic and molecular manipulation to the nanoscale assembly of novel quantum materials-materials whose structural and electronic properties are dominated by quantum mechanics and give rise to either novel behavior or promising technologies.  The primary experimental apparatus for these investigations are custom-built low-temperature scanning probe microscopes capable of both studying and controlling matter at atomic length scales. Beyond these tools, methods and approaches also involve tools of theoretical quantum design, developed synergistically with experiments.  The overall project goal is to create synthetic two-dimensional nanomaterials exhibiting new properties and states of matter not possible in their natural-materials counterparts. The scope of this project targets exquisite control of internal quantum degrees of freedom-such as electron amplitude and phase engineering through local bond-length manipulation-to enable new electronic behavior sought in modern science and technology. Work focuses on two-dimensional materials and strain-engineered phases, involving variants of Dirac materials such as graphene and the related dichalcogenide honeycomb structure molybdenum disulfide.  Local probes and application of these materials are at the forefront of experimental studies and are relevant to a burgeoning class of new designer materials. Specific experiments include: using atomic-scale strain texturing to embed pseudoelectric and pseudomagnetic gauge fields into artificial molecular graphene, and pseudoelectric fields within ""artificial atoms"" of other strained two-dimensional monolayers; structure and atomic manipulation of boundary states and topological confinement within the same materials; assembly of electron quasicrystals and non-periodic matter."

These coacervates have similarities to cellular organelles that contain intrinsically disordered proteins and are not encapsulated in a membrane, hence their being named ""membraneless organelles"".  Protein coacervates have been linked to many important biological processes and are also known to be key components of moisture-resistant adhesives produced by marine organisms, which have applications in medicine as surgical sealants. There is also considerable interest in use of coacervation to create materials that can be used as drug carriers, cell scaffolds, or for engineering applications. The research group of Professor Timothy Deming at University of California Los Angeles is developing a new class of coacervate-forming polypeptides, which are synthetic mimics of natural proteins and whose properties can be rapidly tuned for specific uses. The study of coacervate-forming polypeptides can be used in the efforts to better mimic and understand the physical behavior of disordered proteins and to prepare bioadhesives and biologically-inspired artificial organelles. This project is also contributing to the development of human resources in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

The research team works to identify the molecular parameters that control the response of the molecules to temperature and pH. A pioneering aspect of this research is that the block copolypeptides can have multiple individual chain segments, each sensitive to temperature, ion, or redox changes; hence combinations of stimuli can generate different responses in the assemblies. The proposed materials are designed to form hydrogels.

Performing integrated tasks with an image, such as shape generation, animation, editing, or partial matching, requires structure-aware shape processing. A full shape structure consists of a decomposition into parts, an understanding of which parts are more significant than others, and an ability to measure similarity of parts moving toward recognition. A pipeline that takes as input two- or three-dimensional images, performs accurate segmentation to determine shapes of interest, extracts a shape structure, then recognizes the parts and the shapes would represent a fundamental step forward in artificial vision. The task is challenging because human visual perception does not follow computational rules. For example, two shapes can both be similar to a third shape without being similar to each other. For another, our understanding of meaning of shapes adds a semantic level to our geometric perception: if someone is seated on an object, we classify that object as a chair regardless of its shape. Any useful shape analysis must explicitly model the interplay between semantics and geometric shape. This project aims to develop the foundational theory of shape structure and provide robust implementations of the resulting techniques while maintaining the connection to human semantic perception through benchmarking to user studies.<br/><br/>The Blum medial axis gives a skeletal decomposition of a closed region in Euclidean space. For spatial dimensions 2 and 3, these regions can be interpreted as 2D and 3D shapes, with the skeletal model providing a lower-dimensional representation of the shape. The skeleton, a Whitney stratified set, is a deformation retract of the shape boundary that captures complete geometric information about the boundary of the shape. This project will introduce functions on the medial axis that encode shape geometry in a way that allows for the determination of a parts decomposition and hierarchy within a shape, as well as similarity between parts, for shapes of any finite genus. Based on that analysis, the research will develop formal measures of shape complexity and benchmark results through human perception studies.

Photonic structures consist of patterns of particles, smaller than the wavelength of light, that are artificially bound together in ordered arrangements. In this case, the optical properties of the photonic structures can be changed in response to mechanical pressure or external magnetic fields. To build such responsive structures, the team explores methods for making magnetic colloidal particles that can deform their shapes when they interact with each other, and then study how these particles come together and assemble into ordered structures. These shape-deformable magnetic colloidal particles can assemble into unusual structures that display interesting responsive optical properties which cannot be achieved with conventional solid particles. This project enhances the understanding of how soft colloidal particles interact with each other in solution, how they assemble into large-scale structures, and how they respond to external magnetic fields. The project is also technologically important as it will enable the fabrication of novel optical materials with rapid and significant optical changes to external stimuli, such as magnetic fields and mechanical forces. The resulting materials may find great use in practical applications that may have a very positive impact on the society, including novel visual displays, colorimetric pressure sensors, and anti-counterfeiting devices. The project also expands research-based learning beyond the University of California Riverside campus by attracting K-12 and undergraduate students especially those from underrepresented groups from local schools and community colleges to the proposed research. Besides hosting summer research experience programs at the University of California Riverside, the PI has a partnership with colleagues in local community colleges to carry out relevant research in their laboratories in order to provide more students with opportunities to be exposed to cutting-edge research.

Research that will be performed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in the course of this project focuses on two important problems faced by contemporary statistical science: scalability and robustness. The goal of the project is to advance our understanding of statistical techniques that involve (a) high-dimension covariance matrix estimation, and (b) distributed statistical estimation protocols. Obtained results will be of interest to scientists working on theory as well as applications.<br/><br/>One part of this project aims at answering open questions related to high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation for the heavy-tailed distributions. Such distributions serve as a viable model for data corrupted with outliers, an almost inevitable scenario in applications. Covariance matrix is one of the most fundamental objects in high-dimensional data analysis: many important statistical tools, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression analysis, involve covariance estimation as a crucial step. For instance, PCA has striking connections to nonlinear dimension reduction and manifold learning techniques, genetics, computational biology, among many others. However, the assumptions underlying the theoretical analysis of most existing estimators, such as various modifications of the sample covariance matrix, are often restrictive and do not hold for real-world scenarios. Using tools from the random matrix theory,  the PI will develop a new class of robust estimators that are numerically tractable, show good practical performance and enjoy strong theoretical guarantees under much weaker conditions than currently available alternatives. Specifically, the goal of the project is to design estimators that admit tight concentration around the unknown ""true"" covariance matrix under weak assumptions on the underlying distribution, such as existence of moments of only low order.  Another part of this project is devoted to novel algorithms for scalable estimation that can take advantage of the ""divide and conquer"" approach. Divide and conquer paradigm assumes that data is stored and analyzed in a distributed way by a cluster consisting of several machines: each of the machines in a cluster works on its own sub-sample while communication among different machines is limited, and final results are obtained by piecing the outcomes of these distributed computations together. The PI will develop a class of new divide and conquer strategies supported by strong theoretical evidence. The project will investigate connections between the distributed estimation strategies and robustness of resulting algorithms -- an important characteristic of large distributed systems."

These properties of thermal expansion and thermal softening are similar in steels (which are mostly iron), and are important for the engineering of machines, infrastructure, or devices of any size. Perhaps surprisingly, in 2019 it is not known how to calculate the thermal expansion of iron (or its thermal softening). Some of the parts of the story, and some relations between them, are known in principle. For example, atoms vibrate more vigorously with increasing temperature, and small details about atom vibrations make a big difference in how iron expands and softens. A big challenge for iron, however, is that its magnetism also changes with temperature. The vibrations of iron atoms are affected by the change in magnetism, and proper calculations of these effects are only emerging today. This project will complete this story by experiments. It will measure the vibrations of iron atoms, obtaining the full spectrum of their vibrational frequencies. Measurements will be performed at temperatures from -258 C to +800 C, simultaneously at pressures varying from 1 atmosphere to 90,000 atmospheres. Obtaining high temperatures and high pressures simultaneously and precisely is the technical challenge. It will be undertaken with diamond anvil pressure cells. The vibrational spectra of very small samples (less than 0.1 mm in size) in the pressure cells will be measured with synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory. The PI expects to learn how the change in magnetism with temperature and pressure alters the thermal expansion of iron. Other materials such as Invar may be studied in a similar way if time permits. Some of the concepts about atom vibrations, and how they influence the thermodynamics of materials, are appropriate for video content. Some public video instruction is already available. It will be organized, and new content added, to make it useful for teaching. A high school intern will be mentored during the summer, and the PI will also help support Girls Who Code to teach computer programming to underrepresented students in Pasadena middle schools.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This experimental project on bcc (alpha) iron will obtain thermodynamic quantities underlying the equation of state V(T,P) by measuring the entropy of vibrations at different combinations of P (pressure), T (temperature), and V (volume) in the sample. Diamond anvil cells are required to obtain the pressures, and the sample in the pressure cell must be heated or cooled.  The main effort will be inelastic nuclear resonant x-ray scattering (NRIXS) of 57Fe, with samples at simultaneous pressure and temperature.  NRIXS can determine the phonon density of states and hence the vibrational entropy. Simultaneous measurements of nuclear forward scattering will show  changes in the magnetism, and diffraction will give the specific volume.  Thermodynamic relationships can  give the thermal expansion, beta, and the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus, dB/dT, but now the individual contributions from vibrations, magnetism and electrons can be identified separately, and usefully compared to the total entropy known from calorimetry. Both beta and dB/dT are interesting for iron because they should be altered by interactions between atom vibrations and magnetism. Support from ab initio theory is proposed through a collaboration.  The PI now teaches his course on phase transitions in materials using a flipped classroom pedagogy. As part of this work, he will curate and develop video content to convey essential concepts in entropy, free energy and phase transformations in materials for distribution on public video platforms such as YouTube. A high school intern will be mentored during the summer.

This effect at the enzyme's active site, called electrostatic preorganization, is detected through quantum mechanical tools.  The understanding of electrostatic preorganization and the development of these quantum mechanical tools are applied to engineer artificial enzymes with enhanced catalytic functions. The resulting artificial enzymes are potentially important in disease prevention, industrial production of chemicals, and environmental remediation. In addition, the project promotes professional development and training of high school science teachers through an initiative called ""See the chemical bond"". This initiative uses visual and quantum mechanically enabled techniques in a classroom setting to give substance to the important though often poorly understood concept of chemical bonds.<br/><br/>This proposal develops quantum-mechanically rigorous computational techniques to probe electrostatic preorganization, and assesses its effect on the proficiency of both natural and artificial enzymes. An extension of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) in conjunction with dynamics simulations will be developed to determine the perturbative influence of the full protein structure to the charge density (rho) in an enzyme's active site. The directed evolution of artificial enzymes are followed using these probes, while interrogating the progression of preorganization. These studies detect the extent to which enzymes evolve toward improved long-range electrostatics.

These polymers can self-assemble into larger structures that can rapidly transport excited states through space, thus mimicking the fundamental aspects of photosynthetic organelles. The project is providing training opportunities for graduate students.  Professor Ayzner is using the topic of energy harvesting as the vehicle to teach advanced chemical problem-solving skills to transfer students, thereby helping to prepare them for sustained success in the chemical sciences. <br/><br/>Accomplishing the formation of an artificial light-harvesting organelle first requires laying a foundation for assembling and interfacing an efficient electronic energy transfer (EET) relay with a larger structural scaffold. To this end, Professor Ayzner is synthesizing and assembling conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) into donor/acceptor complexes, whose structure and thermodynamics can be controlled via the coupling between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom. This project elucidates how the backbone of a CPE influences the EET efficiency within the complex by systematically tuning the mean polyelectrolyte length and chemical structure. The phase separation behavior and EET in co-existing phases of inter-CPE complexes is then characterized to elucidate the influence of excess ions on light-harvesting. Complexes are then interfaced with self-assembled vesicle-type compartments to form the foundation of a soft light-harvesting super-structure. Characterization of resulting assemblies involves combining time-resolved electronic spectroscopy, photon scattering, microscopy and rheological measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conversion of water to oxygen is catalyzed in plants by a manganese and calcium cluster and Dr. Agapie synthesizes analogues in his lab.  Dr. Agapie and his team study the reactions of these artificial analogues in comparison with the natural systems.

OEC is responsible for converting water into oxygen in Photosystem II (PSII), a protein complex that captures photons from sunlight and uses them to create electrons needed in chemical reactions in plants. The conversion of water to dioxygen is important for energy storage and conversion in artificial photosynthesis. The transformation of water into oxygen generates reducing equivalents used to transform low-energy precursors, such as carbon dioxide into energy-rich ones, such as sugars (in biological systems) or liquid hydrocarbons (an attractive target in artificial systems). Despite significant advances in the study of PSII, the atomic level mechanism of water oxidation continues to be debated. Supported by preliminary results that demonstrate that structural motifs relevant to the OEC and desired O-O bond formation chemistry can be accessed, mechanistic and reactivity studies are performed. Cluster models of the OEC displaying the dangler metal motif are prepared. In these clusters, the metal centers are site differentiated, which allows for systematic evaluation of the effect of remote metals on their properties. The effect of the cluster geometry, composition, redox state and spin state, on reactivity and spectroscopy are addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cellular scaffold, for instance, grows and reorganizes its shape in response to environmental stimuli that trigger the production of the scaffold materials and the molecules that regulate its organization.

However, achieving the necessary accuracy for realistic and predictive simulations is a challenge. In this project, Dr. Paesani and his group are developing and applying a novel and powerful simulation methodology to model water oxidation in a class of highly porous solids known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Water oxidation is one of the key reactions in natural photosynthesis. Therefore, understanding the steps involved in water oxidation at the molecular level may aid in the development of artificial photosynthetic systems. MOFs are a relatively new class of materials and are ideal for these catalysts. The studies carried out by Dr. Paesani and his group are advancing both the theory and the computer modeling of MOFs and their chemistry, which are key to the rational development of new catalysts. In parallel with the research activities, an innovative education and outreach plan is being established to introduce freshman and sophomore undergraduate students to computational methods in chemistry and materials research.  Dr. Paesani and his group are also promoting interest in STEM disciplines among underprivileged and underrepresented minority students through the development of summer exchange programs at the University of California - San Diego.<br/><br/>The fundamental understanding of how to control water oxidation to molecular oxygen is a prerequisite for the development of artificial systems to harvest and convert solar energy as well as to enable visible-light-driven organic synthesis. It is well known that the availability of water as an electron donor opens up a wide variety of reductive processes that can be driven with electricity or sunlight. Since water is one of the ultimate products of fossil fuel combustion, the conversion of H2O molecules back into fuel involves thermodynamically uphill reactions that remove oxygen atoms. In this project, Dr. Paesani and his group are performing fundamental studies to investigate the elementary steps involved in water oxidation reactions in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are a relatively new class of porous materials with large surface areas that have already found application in gas storage (e.g., methane and hydrogen storage), carbon capture, hydrocarbon separation, chemical sensing, nonlinear optics, biomedical imaging, drug delivery, catalysis, electrical and proton conductivity, magnetism, and luminescence. Since MOF structure and physicochemical properties are highly tunable, MOFs represent promising platforms for building efficient functional devices for solar energy harvesting and conversion. Dr. Paesani and his group are developing and applying novel simulation methodologies that combine many-body representations of the molecular interactions with advanced techniques to describe chemical reactivity in the condensed phase to characterize the elementary steps associated with catalytic processes in MOFs. This information is key to the rational design of new MOF structures with properties specifically tailored for solar energy harvesting and conversion. The interdisciplinary nature of the research project represents an extraordinary opportunity for training at the interface of different disciplines, providing bridges and inter-connections between the fundamental laws of physics and the molecular properties of materials at the nanoscale.

In natural systems, such as photosynthesis, the absorption of light energy can be translated efficiently into separated electrical charges.  These charges can then be used to conduct a range of important chemical reactions, and the overall process is called photochemistry.  Using modern synthetic chemistry, Professors Tolbert, Schwartz and Rubin are creating molecules that absorb light efficiently and then separate the electrical charges via a series of cascades across the molecules.  Then, they are examining ways to use those separated charges to do useful chemistry.  In the process, they are training a group of graduate students in interdisciplinary science.

The principal challenges in producing artificial electron transfer cascades are first to create well-defined donor/acceptor pairs and second to place additional acceptors with progressively lower LUMOs at precise positions so that their energy gradient leads to spatial separation of the initially created charge pair.  The cascades are being constructed starting with amphiphilic, water-soluble pi-conjugated polymers that assemble into networks of electrically-interconnected micelles. The conjugated polyelectrolytes are then assembled with charged C60 derivatives or other pi-conjugated acceptors.  The structure of the assembly and the energetics of both the polymer donor and the pi-conjugated electron acceptor are being tuned.  The electron transfer cascades are being characterized using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and the structures are being correlated with the observed photochemical properties.

Recent advances owe much to a shift in focus to a `synthetic' approach. Rather than seeking nonabelian anyons as elementary excitations in 'natural' electronic systems, the disparate ingredients required are assembled through proximity effects.  For example, Majorana bound state - the simplest nonabelian defect state - can be engineered by inducing superconductivity in an effectively spinless, one dimensional fermionic wire. As the experimental hunt for Majorana bound states intensifies, the question arises as to whether richer parafermion and Fibonacci anyon ground states can be realized using the same synthetic approach. This proposal describes a route towards realizing nonabelian defects in the recently discovered fractional Chern insulators in graphene heterostructures, including parafermion bound states.  Fractional Chern insulators are generalizations of fractional quantum Hall states to lattice systems.  Like conventional fractional quantum Hall states, the low-lying charged excitations of gapped fractional Chern insulators have anyonic statistics; however, the lattice degree of freedom endows them with new experimental tunability. Under the current proposal, we will classify fractional Chern insulator ground states in lithographically defined superlattices and use them to Engineer lattice defects and sublattice selective contacts for measurement-only braiding of nonabelian defect states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SSL devices use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) coated with a phosphor material, which converts blue or ultraviolet light from the LED to white light. The emitted light must span the entire visible spectrum, similar to sunlight, in order for the lighting to accurately show the colors of illuminated objects.  However, phosphors with such broadband emission are very rare. Commercial SSL devices mix LEDs and phosphors of different colors to achieve broadband white light, but a single material that emits broadband white light is highly desirable for artificial illumination. Layered hybrid perovskites are crystalline materials that contain alternating organic and inorganic layers.  The inorganic layers of some layered metal-halide perovskites can convert ultraviolet light to broadband white light. The proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Electronic and Photonic Materials programs in the Division of Materials Research, seeks to expand white-light emission to a much larger range of lattices. Nontoxic compositions, in particular, will be targeted. To date, the discovery of new white-light-emitting metal halides remains serendipitous. This research will identify and disseminate design rules for the predictable synthesis of white-light emitters.  Undergraduate researchers will be involved in all aspects of the research. A new course will introduce general chemistry concepts to first-year students using examples from materials chemistry. Concepts in solid state and inorganic chemistry, which are typically not included in first-year courses, will be introduced in general chemistry in order to draw students to these fields early. Outreach activities at local high schools and at Stanford University will also emphasize the importance of materials discovery, with demonstrations including new materials synthesized in the PI's group. <br/>  <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Broadband white-light emission from a single material without discrete chromophores is extremely unusual. Such an emission has been reported from the inorganic layers of 2D hybrid halide perovskites, attributed to exciton self-trapping. Although a growing number of metal-halide broadband emitters are now being reported, they remain as relatively rare, isolated examples driven by serendipitous discovery. This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Electronic and Photonic Materials programs in the Division of Materials Research, seeks to probe the generality of exciton self-trapping in a large range of lattices to substantially increase the number of intrinsic white-light emitters. Synthetic and optical studies of 0D, 1D, and 2D lattices with varying composition and connectivity will allow for the articulation of overarching design rules for the rational synthesis of white-light emitters. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies will probe correlations between the ground-state structure of the lattices and excited-state distortions associated with self-trapping. These methods will also interrogate the role of extrinsic self-trapping by studying the influence of native and chemically induced lattice defects on the emission.  The fundamental studies outlined here are expected to set the stage for the synthesis of materials that can manipulate light in a predictable manner. Single-source white-light emitters eliminate problems associated with current methods of producing white light by mixing multiple different phosphors or light-emitting diodes. The fundamentally different emission mechanism in these hybrids compared to those of inorganic phosphors and organic LEDS may open new niches for their use in large-area displays and panels. Undergraduate researchers will be involved in all aspects of the research. New materials synthesized for this project will be included in high school outreach events. A new course will introduce general chemistry concepts to first-year students using examples from materials chemistry.

Chemists strive to mimic the complexity of these biological structures with artificial analogs, but these mimics cannot approach the complexity of natural enzymes. Self-assembly is a powerful approach to create large, complex molecules without the challenge of complex step-by-step synthesis. This process is similar to molecular-level Lego, whereby individual pieces can be simply put together to make a larger, more complex structure. In this research project, Prof. Hooley aims to develop self-assembly approaches to creating new chemical structures that act in a manner similar to enzymes and to explore the potential applications of these structures in catalysis. This project provides interdisciplinary research training to graduate students and opportunities to underrepresented undergraduates for intellectual and creative development.

Prof. Hooley's research group seeks to remedy this by creating new functional synthetic receptors via metal-ligand based self-assembly. This project focuses on three specific areas:  1) the application of internal functions of ligands to control (via secondary weak interactions) the self-assembly process, including self-sorting and the control of stoichiometry and stereochemistry of cage complexes; 2) post-assembly modifications of internal functional groups to alter reactivity and to allow controlled, reversible structural switching between different polyhedral geometries and trapping of cage complexes; and 3) the application of these complexes as biomimetic catalysts in tandem, orthogonal catalysis. An important objective in this area is to demonstrate that the sequestration of acidic and basic functions in cage interiors allows normally incompatible reactions to be performed in a single pot."

Among the several phenomena that may be responsible for this failure is so-called ""sensitivity to imperfections,"" or the highly oscillatory nature of energy minimizers resulting in non-compactness even in very simple geometries like cylinders. The imperfection sensitivity phenomenon poses an ongoing challenge to engineers working with a wide range of thin-shelled structures, from aircraft and automotive components, buildings, poles, and other civil infrastructures, to carbon nanotubes and biopolymer shells. One of the goals of this project is to use the general theory of buckling of thin structures to quantify the imperfection sensitivity phenomenon. Another goal is to solve the longstanding problem of determining the rigidity of a given shell, which is believed to be identified by the principal curvatures of the shell. <br/><br/>While the problem of determining the rigidity of plates is well understood, determining the rigidity of a given shell has been a longstanding problem in continuum mechanics. Recent results on shells in the linear elasticity setting, with vector fields satisfying Robin boundary conditions on the thin face of the shell, provide evidence that the rigidity of a shell is determined solely by the principal curvatures of the shell's mid-surface. One of the goals of the project is to extend ansatz-free lower bounds to the nonlinear geometric rigidity setting. The strategy is to use existing estimates inducing artificial boundary conditions by test functions as well as a universal Korn interpolation inequality, which reduces the linear geometric rigidity estimate to a Poincar? type estimate. Once this is done, a new hierarchy of shell theories with smaller gaps will naturally follow, which will encompass the existing ones derived by Gamma-convergence. The second part of the project is to further develop the theory of buckling of thin structures. The theory has two ingredients: (i) proving sharp Korn's inequalities, and (ii) proving the existence of bending-free trivial branches. While (i) has been almost entirely done in previous work, (ii) is the goal of the second part of the project. The investigator and collaborators will adopt the approach of quantitative implicit function theorems and quantitative approximation of nonlinear elasticity solutions by the ones in the linear setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, their use for applications in quantum computing, communication and sensing has been limited by the relatively short lifetime of the excited state of the electrons in these dots.  Recently, our team have discovered that polarizing the nuclear spins in these dots leads to a surprising and dramatic increase of the lifetime by many orders of magnitude opening the potential for using quantum dots in the next generation of quantum electronics.  This project will explore the fundamental physics behind this dramatic increase in lifetime both experimentally and theoretically. The research will support the development of highly trained people, (including students from the NSF-Imes-Moore Bridge-program in Applied Physics) critical to the infrastructure of nano and quantum technology, at all levels of higher education including postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students.  The results of this research will not only open up potential applications in quantum electronics but could provide advances in areas such as magnetic resonance imaging and the development of a path for transitioning from the Moore's law to the new paradigm of a post CMOS era.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>In previous NSF supported work, we discovered dynamic nuclear spin quieting (DNSQ) in single and coupled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) produced by optical coupling to the e-h spin that is accompanied by clear dynamical nuclear spin polarization (DNSP). The results show both local and nonlocal creation of mesoscopic metastable nuclear spin configurations characterized by DNSQ. The effect is long lived (>1sec) and reflects creation and locking of a metastable mesoscopic nuclear state involving >10,000 nuclei. The underlying physics is not clear but is obviously mediated by a nonlinear coupling between the optically driven e-h spins and the nuclei of the quantum dot through hyperfine coupling. The large exciton Bohr radius results in interaction of the electron-hole spins with nearly all the nuclei in the dot, unlike a simple atom with one nucleus. The results are highly significant for application of QDs or other structures to spin based quantum electro-photonic devices, such as quantum repeaters (e -spin serves as memory and the spontaneously emitted photons serves as the flying qubit) and for the potential use of the nuclear ensemble states for quantum metrology, classical memory and perhaps even improving MRIs. The importance of this research is rooted in that locked DNSQ increases e- -spin coherence time by more than three orders of magnitude , without dynamic intervention. The theoretical studies have, thus far, not provided a unified picture consistent with all the data, and the nature of the quiescent nuclear spin ensemble states remains a mystery. The proposed theory focuses on the properties of the quiescent nuclear states vis-a-vis the thermal nuclear states under optical control of the e-spin. Spin glass concepts and methodology will be adapted to the mesoscopic nature and the spin dynamics of the ensemble, to formulate a detailed theory for a comprehensive understanding of the physics. The results could lead to advances in electronic-photonic information processing on a long time scale, such as a quantum repeater or measurement processes. The nuclear quiescent state, analogous to spin glass, may also provide a laboratory for classical computer science and beyond. The proposal has two scientific objectives: 1. Measure and theoretically understand the dynamics of the interaction between the two distinct quantum systems (the nuclear ensemble spin and the e- -spin) leading the various mesoscopic metastable DNSQ states. This includes determining both longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates of the nuclear spin in these states including determining the level of quantum coherence in the nuclear spin states following switching; and 2. Measure and theoretically predict the e- -spin decoherence in single and coupled QDs as a function of the various mesoscopic nuclear states. This work will result in improving the understanding of the interaction between a non-equilibrium microscopic quantum system (a few e-- spins) and a mesoscopic quantum system (number of nuclear spins < thermodynamic limit). The complexity of the mechanism of optical control of the e --spin states stems from the back action of the resulting modified mesoscopic nuclear state on the optically controlled e- -spins . For quantum metrology, this is a paradigm system for measuring the properties of the mesoscopic system (nuclear) via the electron states or as a quantum measurement of the correlated electron systems under the influence of the nuclear ensembles as controllable environment. For potential applications, the broad bandwidth (THz) of the quantum physics enables high-speed optical control without connectivity problems and operates at 4-10 K."

These include the conversion of solar energy into electric energy in natural photosynthesis and in artificial light harvesting devices. This program develops methods for studying these elementary events by measuring the response of complex molecules to sequences of ultrafast optical laser pulses.

Spectroscopic techniques that aim at the direct detection of electronic and vibrational coherence, as well as nonadiabatic dynamics where the Born Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, are developed. Broadband resonant and off-resonant Raman techniques that can directly probe the passage of molecules through conical intersections are designed, and adequate protocols for their simulation are developed. A highly-intuitive, diagrammatic superoperator formalism is developed for computing the response of molecules to quantum and stochastic light and applied towards creating novel optical pulse sequences by utilizing pulse shaping, phase control, and chiral polarization configurations. <br/>New nonlinear signals aimed at providing unambiguous spectroscopic signatures of conical intersections through electronic and nuclear coherences are investigated. The quantum properties of light, such as photon entanglement are used as additional tools for probing molecules and chromophore aggregates by providing information that is not accessible by classical light. For example, entangled and squeezed photons offer temporal and spectral resolutions not achievable by other means. Detection schemes that combine coincidence measurements of individual entangled photons and interferometry are explored and used to investigate the elementary charge and energy migration processes in light harvesting in photosynthetic antennae and reaction centers. Signals involving multiple photon coincidence with temporal and spectral gating are predicted. Photon statistics measurements and higher-order radiation field correlation functions are calculated and shown to provide novel spectroscopic tools for molecular dynamical processes. Incoherent detection schemes of coherent optical signals by fluorescence or electric currents, which are very sensitive and can allow the study of single molecules are developed and investigated."

Conventional synthetic materials do not display such properties because they are composed of inanimate molecules. In contrast, biological systems consist of active, energy transducing molecules which continuously push and pull on each other, producing active stresses. These active stresses make biological systems examples of active matter, and are ultimately are responsible for many of their unusual behaviors. Creating artificial active matter opens up a new route towards constructing materials with lifelike functionalities. However, a significant obstacle to realizing this possibility is an absence of understanding of how active stresses are produced: given specific elemental building blocks, there are not currently tools to either measure or theoretically predict the magnitude, type, or even the sign of the active stresses. The project will elucidate the foundational principles of active stress generation using a synergistic combination of experiments, simulations, and theory. The work will result in the creation of new experimental tools for measuring active stresses, new synthesis procedures for creating active materials, and new multi-scale modeling techniques for studying active matter. An integrated outreach program will bring the excitement of active matter to K-12 education, undergraduates, and graduates by combining interactive demonstrations, advanced interdisciplinary training, and intensive summer courses.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The research focuses on studying assemblages of microtubules and kinesin-14 molecular motors. The work addresses three fundamental challenges in understanding active stresses generated by such active materials. First is the development of tools to measure active stresses at different length scales using optical tweezers, fluid flow measurements, microfluidics, and 3D printing, in combination with theory and simulations. Second, a novel system will be created in which active stress generation will be modulated by directly affixing kinesin-14 to microtubules in predetermined patterns. Theory and simulations will be used to guide which patterns to create, and conversely, measuring the resulting active stress generation in these designed materials will provide a stringent test of theory and simulations. Third, a multi-scale modeling framework will be developed and tested. These will be subsequently related to each other through a combination of analytical calculations and simulations. The resulting models will be made with continual feedback from experiments.

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed.

This capability has the potential to unlock new technologies, including cameras for imaging electron motion inside biomolecules, ultrafast information processors, and devices based on exotic non-equilibrium states of matter. However, these exciting developments will require major advances in our ability to understand and control non-equilibrium quantum systems. To this end, the research team is building an artificial solid in which trapped strontium atoms are used to emulate the behavior of electronic solids on ultrafast-equivalent timescales. Using this approach, the team aims to reveal hitherto invisible ultrafast processes in matter, in regimes beyond the limits of existing theories and experiments. Research activities are integrated into local science education at the high school, community college, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, with a focus on scientific professional development.

As a result of this rescaling of time, the dynamics underlying ultrafast phenomena like tunnel ionization occur over milliseconds rather than attoseconds, and can be observed in extreme slow-motion. The research consists of three related efforts: (1) studies of the impulse response of interacting quantum systems; (2) exploration of exotic strong-driving Hamiltonians beyond those which are currently possible in the solid state; and (3) realization of controllable emergent non-equilibrium phases in driven lattice systems. The quantum-emulator-based approach enables clean realization and study of strong-field phenomena, provides a tool for validation and extension of existing approximate theories of ultrafast interactions, and opens the path to studying new forms of matter and new phenomena that emerge in non-equilibrium regimes beyond the reach of existing ultrafast experiments."

This work capitalizes on an exciting and unexpected finding from the Devaraj lab, that biomimetic materials can be programmed to absorb biomolecules out of solution and concentrate them in a sponge-like interior. Synthetic cells have the promise to revolutionize biomanufacturing by overcoming inherent limitations faced by living cells, for instance their inability to withstand harsh conditions and toxins. Similar to organs in the human body, living cells have evolved to have interior compartments known as organelles, which have specific functions and assist in cell maintenance and function by concentrating reactants or separating mutually incompatible reactions. However it is unclear how much spatial organization and compartmentalization is necessary for the construction of a synthetic cell. Lipid sponges can help answer this question because they can be programmed to trap diverse classes of biomolecules and reactions.

The work is also contributing to outreach activities that are introducing the concept of synthetic cells to the broader San Diego educational community, with the aim of stimulating the entry of low-income and underrepresented student populations into STEM fields.

A lipidic mesophase system recently discovered in the Devaraj lab is being developed into a synthetic cell compartment capable of mimicking the highly crowded environment of a cell and achieving high rates and export of biological products. Surfactants can form micron-sized sponge mesophase droplets in aqueous media. These structures are termed lipid sponges to reflect their sponge-like interior network and capacity to absorb and retain biological molecules. Thanks to the high internal surface area and porous nanostructure, lipid sponges can spontaneously encapsulate high quantities of dyes and small molecules. The porous continuous structure of the lipid mesophase enables facile transport into and out of the droplets surmounting one of the key issues that has plagued lipid vesicle-based synthetic cell studies. The specific aims of this project are: (1) engineering the physico-chemical properties of lipid sponge droplets by studying the nanostructures that are formed from binary mixtures of surfactants, with the goal of improving stability and uniformity, and (2) achieving programmable compartmentalization of biochemical pathways within the droplets. Two key biochemical pathways are being studied: carbon fixation, to demonstrate the ability to supply increased levels of CO2 within a droplet and improve reaction kinetics; and controlled protein synthesis and release, through encapsulation of a DNA-programmable TX-TL (transcription-translation) system. The project has the potential to significantly advance bottom-up synthetic cell design by achieving a novel modular and programmable organelle for incorporation into artificial cells, and is providing a valuable model system for the studying the effects of colocalization and sequestration on biochemical reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists can now very directly explore nature under extreme conditions such as those that occur with merging black holes or neutron stars. Cosmologists intend to use gravitational waves to probe deep into the earliest moments of the big bang. Rather than monitoring changes to the lengths of the 4km-long arms of the LIGO detectors, cosmologists are seeking the imprint of gravitational waves on polarization patterns in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) -- light that, for the most part, last interacted with matter when the universe was just a few hundred thousand years old. If the simplest and most empirically successful scenario for the generation of density perturbations in the early universe is correct, the resulting signal should be observable. Such a detection would open up a new, and more direct, window on this ultra-early epoch as well as our first experimental probe of quantum-mechanical aspects of the gravitational field and allow us to test theories of the origin of spatial structure (density inhomogeneities) in our universe. To achieve the sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), being targeted by experiments in the planning stages now (such as the ?Stage IV? experiment), requires the development of new statistical tools -- in particular for the quantification of uncertainties in the removal of contaminants to the signal of interest. This project will directly address these statistical challenges by focusing on the two main obstacles for the detection of primordial gravitational waves in the CMB: contamination from gravitational lensing and millimeter wavelength radiation from the interstellar medium in our own galaxy. The statistical methodology resulting from the proposed work will not only enable some very exciting science, but also inform a broad range of statistical problems associated with large spatial datasets. <br/><br/>This project directly addresses the two main statistical challenges associated with the detection of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB): contamination from gravitational lensing and the emission of millimeter wavelength radiation from the interstellar medium in our own galaxy. The first part of the project is the development of a full-scale Bayesian solution to the delensing problem using a new re-parameterization technique derived from a dynamical systems characterization of delensing and an artificial decoherence technique specifically designed to overcome the slow mixing of Gibbs samplers associated with CMB delensing. This custom re-parameterization, using the physics of how lensing aliases E-modes and B-modes in the CMB polarization, can exhibit properties of both a sufficient parametrization for the E-mode and an ancillary parameterization for the polarization B-mode. This is crucial for fast mixing of the main Gibbs chain and for high acceptance rates of Hamiltonian Markov chains for Bayesian delensing. The second main part of the project directly addresses the challenges associated with foreground contaminants: in particular the quantification of uncertainty that propagates through the observations to the estimated B-mode fluctuations from primordial gravitational waves. The project will focus on developing new random field models of the non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity aimed at quantifying uncertainty rather than the estimation, and subsequent removal, of foreground emission. The resulting models and techniques will also inform general statistical applications associated with non-stationary random field models and the hierarchical modeling of non-Gaussian spatial random fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These macroelectronics applications require innovative approaches to low-cost, large-area electronics, as the drivers are not compatible with the larger and more well-established microelectronics industry. To reduce costs and improve market potential for thin film macroelectronics, research into next-generation macroelectronic thin film deposition and processing must include a focus on low-temperature solution processing. The principal investigator is studying a solvent mixture used to dissolve cheap bulk materials to make inks that, upon solution deposition, convert to semiconductor thin films under mild conditions. The primary goals of this project include understanding the chemistry of bulk material dissolution and leveraging that information to deposit stable semiconductor thin films of novel composition that are promising for next-generation solar cells. Integrated into this plan is an outreach program specifically aimed at local community college students. The principal investigator is partnering with Cerritos Community College, an institution with a large number of underrepresented students, to provide internships on materials research. The objective of this annual 8-week outreach program is to provide these students with STEM research opportunities that are not afforded to them at the community college level, and thereby increase their transfer rate to 4-year institutions. An internship alumni network will be established to maintain formal contact with the interns after they complete the program.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/> Despite decades of developments in semiconductor thin film deposition, the vast majority of methods require costly, energy intensive conditions. As such, there is a need to develop deposition processes that are less capital- and energy-intensive. The direct dissolution of bulk materials to yield solution processable inks that convert to thin films under mild conditions can result in significant cost reductions. This project directly addresses the challenge by studying inks prepared by bulk chalcogenide, oxide, and metal dissolution with thiol-amine solvent mixtures. The principal investigator is leveraging his expertise in inorganic chemistry and materials synthesis to meet the following objectives: (1) Understand the chemistry behind the dissolution of bulk materials with the thiol-amine solvent mixture. While a wide scope of bulk materials has demonstrated solubility in this solvent mixture, there is little to no understanding of the dissolution mechanism. The dissolution mechanism is being interrogated through an examination of the resulting molecular solutes and the chemical factors that affect the kinetics of dissolution. In parallel, a dual-space approach that combines Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray total scattering data is being employed to monitor thermal conversion of the amorphous dried molecular inks into crystalline chalcogenide thin films. This approach is intelligently informing solution processing and crystallization of phase-pure, high-quality chalcogenide thin films. (2) Use the thiol-amine solvent mixture to solution process promising chalcogenide thin films for solar energy conversion. The large palette of inks now available with this system are being used to solution process more novel, compositionally complex, multinary chalcogenide semiconductor thin films with properties amenable to solar energy conversion, such as optimal band gap, polar crystal structures, and materials with high thermodynamic stability comprised of Earth abundant elements. The most promising candidates are being explored in next-generation solar cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thousands of these Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arrive at Earth each day, but their nature remains a mystery. The biggest obstacle has been the low spatial resolution of the radio telescopes that have discovered FRBs to date, which has been insufficient to accurately pinpoint the distant host galaxies from which they originate. The Deep Synoptic Array (DSA) is a new radio telescope, designed to tackle the FRB problem head on by detecting 100 FRBs each year, and localizing each burst to its host galaxy. As well as solving the mystery of the origin of FRBs, these events can be used to provide a powerful probe of the intergalactic medium, the ionized gas occupying the space between galaxies. Immediately after detection of each FRB, an alert will be shared with the entire astronomical community. Students, ranging from K-12 through undergraduate and graduate level, will be involved in designing, building and operating the DSA, as well as participating in delivery of science, seeding the next generation of radio astronomers in the US.<br/><br/>The DSA will be a radio interferometer purpose-built for FRB detection and direct localization. It will be located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), heavily leveraging existing infrastructure to minimize both cost and deployment timescale. The array will consist of 110 x 5m dishes spanning an area of diameter 2.25 km, and will continuously survey for FRBs at frequencies between 1280 - 1530 MHz.  The use of low-cost antennas outfitted with custom-designed receivers and a novel digital back-end will deliver a sample of >300 FRBs localized to < 3-arcsecond regions within a 3-year science program. FRB alerts will be issued via the VOEvent service to the entire astronomical community to ensure rapid follow-up of DSA-localized FRBs. The project will enable transformational advances in our understanding of the origins of FRBs, and of the unseen baryons in the circumgalactic medium and intergalactic medium. The low-cost implementation of the DSA technology will also offer a framework for the US community to develop a future facility for mapping the radio sky with unmatched survey speed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebra is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, whereas model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades logic has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering. For about fifteen years, the PI has been involved in a collaborative effort to develop a model-theoretic treatment of asymptotic analysis. These investigations are naturally related to other fields within mathematics (mainly logic and analysis) but may also lead to novel applications of differential equations in science and engineering. They recently led to some decisive positive results, and many questions which seemed out of reach previously may now be answerable.<br/><br/>More concretely, the goal of this project is to unify three seemingly very different approaches to enrich the real continuum by infinitesimal and infinite quantities: surreal numbers, germs of real-valued functions, and transseries. Surreal numbers have a combinatorial flavor and encompass Cantor's ordinal numbers; they were introduced by J. H. Conway in the 1970s in connection with game theory. Germs of real-valued functions are central objects in analysis; they were first systematically studied by P. du Bois-Reymond in the 1870s. Transseries are formal objects that model the growth rates of such germs at infinity; they arose in both analysis and logic during the 1980s. Their formal nature also makes transseries suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems. The goal of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of these structures, and to establish links between them. For example, we would like to know: Are there analytic structures (Hardy fields) with the same logical features as transseries? Is there a natural isomorphism between surreals and transseries? Answers to questions such as these may now be within grasp due to fundamental advances in our understanding of the ideas of number, series, and function within the last decade, and would exhibit heretofore unknown relationships between them."

The applications of the new materials with novel properties range from information storage to anti-counterfeiting and drug delivery, from environmental remediation to drug discovery. NSF C-GEM engages scientists and non-scientists in a variety of research and educational activities, including improved communication to the public. These education and participation programs integrate research with training to establish a diverse chemical workforce. NSF C-GEM presents a new online platform and data management system, GEM-Net, to promote data sharing within and outside the research team. NSF C-GEM is also developing an online video game that allows citizen scientists to participate in the research process and track results. <br/><br/>The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials, NSF C-GEM, is focused on the challenge of preparing polymers whose monomers and dispersity are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting, drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus. The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and establish practical methodologies to this aim. NSF C-GEM fosters innovation at the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and engages scientists and non-scientists in research and educational activities. A diverse set of education and participation programs integrates research with training, establishes a diverse chemical workforce, and improves communication with the public."

This system will be used across a broad range of disciplines. In physics and chemistry, it will contribute to research on the development of new technological materials, including novel magnetic and ferroelectric systems. In geology, it will be an important tool in student and faculty research, primarily for the identification and characterization of rocks and minerals. Work performed using this instrument will significantly enhance the research infrastructure at CSUSB, particularly by furthering access to many experimental techniques (e.g. powder and thin film diffraction, reflectometry) applicable to a wide range of sample types (e.g. thin films, powders, polymers). CSUSB is an undergraduate-focused university and a qualifying Hispanic- and Minority-Serving Institution; thus, acquisition of this instrument will broaden participation of students from underrepresented demographics in state-of-the-art research, with a long-term impact of increasing diversity in STEM fields. Additionally, the ability to provide access to an advanced x-ray diffraction system will support the development of local collaborations with many institutions, including community colleges, other four-year universities, and local industries. Many of these education institutions and industries also serve minority populations that are underrepresented in the physical sciences, compounding the impact of this instrumentation in the development of a diverse STEM pipeline in the local area.<br/><br/>The diffractometer will be utilized for a variety of x-ray scattering techniques. Some of the major features of the instrument include a precision sample positioning stage and Eulerian cradle, enabling the performance of powder, thin film, and grazing incidence diffraction and reflectometry.  A Ge monochromator and pixel area detector will allow for high-resolution scanning and rapid collection of reciprocal space maps, and a multi-position automatic sample chamber will permit the rapid and automatic collection of powder diffraction patterns. These capabilities for rapid data collection and multi-sample analysis will significantly augment the team's research productivity, allowing time for more projects and broader impact of the machine. The diffractometer will enhance research output at CSUSB's NSF-CREST funded Center for Advanced Functional Materials (CAFM). The focus of the work will include: engineering novel ferroelectric and magnetic properties into single-crystal oxide thin films using epitaxial strain and multilayer geometry; optimizing organic ferroelectrics through preparation as thin films and novel polymer composites; and the identification and characterization of rocks and minerals in field and laboratory studies in geology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular class of mathematical models for causal networks, in which a directed link encodes a cause-effect relation between two variables. Although experimental intervention provides a direct means to causal inference, such experiments are often not available or limited in many domains. Consequently, structure learning of causal networks from observational data is an important and active research area in statistics and data science. This project targets a few notorious difficulties in causal network learning from observational data, namely the high-dimensionality, nonlinearity and potential dependence in the data. Novel statistical methods and theory for causal structure learning and causal inference will be developed to overcome these difficulties. Software packages will be released to provide efficient implementation of the methods and algorithms. <br/><br/> <br/>To handle high-dimensionality, instead of estimating the structure of a full DAG, the PI will develop a set of methods for local structure learning that identifies the causal parents of target variables, followed by causal effect estimation given the estimated parent sets. Leveraging recent identifiability results for nonlinear and non-Gaussian DAGs, a sequential Monte Carlo method will be developed to sample causal orders and to estimate the joint intervention effects of a set of variables given a partial causal ordering. To accommodate data dependence among individuals, the DAG model will be generalized to network data via the Kronecker product of graphical models. An algorithm will be developed to estimate parameters and DAG structure under this new model, which iterates between a de-correlation step to remove data dependence and a DAG learning step by a standard method. Theoretical results will be established for the local structure and causal order estimation methods and to justify the de-correlation approach. The project integrates structure learning of graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, nonconvex optimization, nonparametric regression, and conditional independence test into causal discovery and inference on observational data. Moreover, many components in this project are well-motivated by recent single-cell RNA-sequencing data and the construction of causal networks for gene regulation. Application of the methods to the fast accumulating single-cell RNA-sequencing data will produce reliable and accurate inference for the causality of gene expression, which is a fundamental problem in molecular biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transition metals include commonly known metals such as iron, gold, copper, titanium, and platinum.   The transition metal compounds used in this project are useful for increasing the speed of chemical reactions (chemical catalysts). Modeling chemical catalysis and the experiments that demonstrate their properties is challenging due to the complexity of their electronic structure. Professor Hratchian's research is focused on designing and applying new predictive models, which can be translated into useful software to address this complexity.

Professor Hratchian develops new educational programs at UC Merced to improve student success. The outreach and education goals address needs at both graduate and undergraduate levels. At the graduate level, Professor Hratchian is expanding a program introducing students to leaders in quantum chemistry using an informal journal club setting. At the undergraduate level, new computational and simulation modules enhancing learning are being developed and implemented in the curriculum. Professor Hratchian also engages in outreach with local school districts and works with K-8 educators to develop new visualization tools for immersive learning with students in the Merced City School District.<br/><br/>This project has three main scientific objectives to assess currently available approximate spin projection models, to develop and implement new models that address electronic structures posing challenges for current models and to explore metal oxide and metal sulfide chemistry using these new models. The project builds on recent work from the Professor Hratchian's research group developing a hierarchy of affordable and predictive models for studies involving metal oxides, metal sulfides, and other systems suffering from spin contamination. This work is of critical importance in the field as spin contamination limits the expected accuracy of affordable mean-field models.

Co-production of higher-value chemicals can also help to make these processes more economical. However, biomass has a high oxygen content. To make useful chemicals, this oxygen must first be removed. Dehydration is one important route to reducing oxygen content. With this funding from the NSF Division of Chemistry, Drs. Han and Scott of the University of California Santa Barbara are investigating these dehydration reactions. The role of solvents and catalysts are being studied to aid in the design of more effective catalysts for these reactions. At the same time, powerful new measurement methods for probing the fundamental chemistry are being developed. The graduate students on the project are acquiring advanced research skills, and learning to integrate their findings with collaborators. They are also gaining international and industrial perspectives of their research. The PIs and their students are mentoring younger, at-risk students, who are also experiencing first-hand experimental problem-solving.<br/><br/>The efficient conversion of biomass-derived polyols to value-added renewable chemicals by dehydration is an important challenge for heterogeneous catalysis. Conducting such reactions selectively in semi-aqueous solvent systems, under mild reaction conditions, requires the development of highly active, hydrothermally stable catalysts. Their activity can be enhanced by tuning the solvent composition and the catalyst support to promote the partitioning of dissolved reactant molecules to the catalytically active solid, and adsorbed product molecules back into solution. This project elucidates and quantifies the interdependent solid-solvent-solute interactions that control activity and selectivity in catalytic dehydration reactions. In the presence of solid catalysts for acid-catalyzed alcohol dehydration reactions, the dynamics of adsorbed reactants and products, the surface-coupled solvent dynamics, and the partitioning of (co-)solutes to the surface relative to bulk, are being characterized with molecular precision. The measurements are made possible by state-of-the-art, surface-sensitive magnetic resonance tools, including solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR to characterize catalyst supports and active sites with dramatically enhanced sensitivity, and Overhauser DNP to measure the surface diffusivity of solvent molecules which is correlated with the solvation barrier to adsorption. The key questions being addressed are: (1) How can catalytic activity and selectivity in polyol dehydration be controlled, by varying the solvation barrier for solute adsorption to the catalyst surface? (2) How can the solvation barrier for solute approach be modulated, by tuning the hydrophobicity of the catalyst surface and the composition of the solvent mixture? The study generates a basis for new structure-property-function relationships in liquid-phase heterogeneous catalysis, exploring their validity in an important family of reactions for the upgrading of biomass-derived polyols, and advancing the development of surface-sensitive magnetic resonance-based tools to characterize heterogeneous catalysts. The graduate students involved with the project are learning advanced research techniques, and learning to integrate their findings with collaborators.

The broad goals are to conduct research on student resources, study the process of transfer from mathematics to physics and the coevolution of knowledge in the two disciplines, and develop a set of Math / Physics tasks suitable for instruction, research, and assessment materials that will integrate challenging math content with topics covered in upper-division physics core courses.  This project has the potential to impact a gateway course to the upper division for physics majors.  Curricular materials will be shared through electronic clearinghouses and via published research and it is anticipated that the project will inform instruction - both of math methods courses and subsequent physics courses in which the mathematics is used - nationally and internationally. The student population at California State University Fullerton includes many students from groups traditionally underrepresented in physics, so this project will provide access to research-based materials for these students and also ensure a diverse research population. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project brings together physics education research (PER) and research in undergraduate math education (RUME). It blends efforts at identifying and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics with efforts toward understanding knowledge transfer in mathematics. The work targets a key course for physics majors, the mathematical methods course that is offered in most departments at the sophomore- or junior-level. This course is typically intended to be a bridge between introductory physics and calculus courses and the more challenging mathematics and physics encountered by students in the core courses of electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics / quantum mechanics. The project will strengthen the research base in a portion of the curriculum that has, to this point, largely gone unexamined, and will touch upon, and build upon, work in several related areas, including PER in other upper-division courses as well as the extensive research base in undergraduate mathematics education. This proposed work will provide significant insights into transfer by probing the extent to which the nature of student understanding depends upon the disciplinary context.

Interactions with light are fundamental to chemistry.  Lasers, for example, play a central role in molecular diagnostics. The absorption of light and its conversion to electricity is central to solar power and to many of the sensory devices used to guard against chemical and biological threats. Scientists are still unable to answer many critical questions about the behavior of molecules that have absorbed light.  By constructing theoretical models to describe light-activated molecules, Neuscamman's research provides insights that complement and enhance experimental methods.  Neuscamman is also building a multi-level outreach and education effort.  His program uses learn-by-playing and learn-by-teaching principles to improve numerical optimization concepts and methods across K-12 education. This effort centers around the design and deployment of age-appropriate games, such as ""program your own virtual robot"" for high school students. A key feature of this outreach is vertical integration, in which older students, especially undergraduates and high school students, are recruited into the outreach efforts targeting younger students, thus enabling learning-by-teaching. Together, these efforts give students a head start in numerical methods thinking and real-world applications that prepare them for formal calculus training and provide them with the required mathematical skills for scientific endeavors. <br/><br/>The ground state variational principle is the single most important theoretical tool in quantum chemistry, allowing wave function approximations and their orbital shapes to be tailored for the ground state of a specific molecule.  Historically, the modeling of a large variety of chemical processes has been hampered by the lack of analogous tools for excited states.  Such excited states play central roles in understanding light harvesting, atmospheric processes, and energy storage.  Although quantum Monte Carlo methods are able to work directly with rigorous excited state variational principles, they have important limitations and do not, at present, benefit from the same quantum-Monte-Carlo/quantum-chemistry synergies that exist for ground states.  Professor Neuscamman is extending the advantages of excited state variational principles into the ecosystem of traditional quantum chemistry.  This project begins with an excited-state-specific mean field theory that is a direct generalization of Hartree Fock Theory. Professor Neuscamman is developing new excited state generalizations of correlation theories like M'ller Plesset theory and coupled cluster theory.  These methods act both as natural partners for Monte Carlo methods and as powerful tools in their own right.

Due to the extensive use of hard materials as cutting tools and abrasives, the demand for superhard materials has been steadily increasing. The best-known superhard material ? diamond ? is not effective at cutting and drilling steel due to its poor thermal stability in air and its tendency to react with the iron in the steel it is trying to cut. Therefore, there is great interest in finding alternatives to traditional superhard materials. These are needed in the construction, automotive, and other industries to replace costly and low performing traditional hard materials like tungsten carbide. To address these issues, the Principal Investigators (PIs) are designing a new generation of superhard materials that will provide greatly increased hardness and the ability to cut steels and other materials at lower cost. Inspired by the unique properties of natural diamond, the Principal Investigators have focused on creating networks with similar properties in other compounds, focusing on mixtures of electron-rich metals and boron. The novel superhard materials are synthesized at ambient pressure and characterization will be conducted to understand the correlation between material structure and hardness. The educational efforts of the PIs, which address the needs of students ranging from elementary school to college undergraduates, include course development, teacher workshops for elementary, middle, and high schools in the greater Los Angeles area, and school outreach visits. Workforce development occurs through the training of graduate students, who also assist with outreach programs and mentor UCLA undergraduate students through research.  This project is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Hardness is a physical phenomenon dependent on both the chemical bond strength and grain structure of a material. An understanding of how to design new superhard materials thus requires sufficient mechanistic insight and control of both bonding and grain morphology. To address this challenge, the Principal Investigators (PIs) are combining the synthesis of a wide range of transition metal boride systems with high-pressure studies to obtain lattice-specific information about plastic deformations in a broad range of bulk and nanoscale materials. These metal boride structures consist of high valence electron density metals, combined with multiple short boron-boron bonds, providing a highly covalent bonding network that is resistant to slip and dislocations, combined with high electrostatic repulsion that resists bond compression. The goal of the proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, is to synthetically control both grain size and morphology. In bulk materials, this is being accomplished through the decomposition of metastable dodecaboride phases in the WB4 system and through precipitation of secondary phases in the ReB2 system. Additionally, molten salt methods are being used to develop nano grain-sized metal borides such as nano-ReB2 and nano-WB4. These synthetic approaches thus aim to enhance extrinsic hardness in both bulk and nano-sized materials. Materials are being analyzed through Vickers hardness testing and high-pressure experiments in diamond anvil cells. With an understanding of the coupled effects of bonding and grain morphology, the research team aims to systematically tune nanostructured materials and advance the next generation of superhard metal borides. The broader impacts of the work lie in workforce development through the training of graduate students, in the extensive outreach efforts of the PIs, which address the needs of students ranging from elementary school to college undergraduates, and in the significant potential for impact on the commercial cutting, drilling and machining industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fully-coherent samples, so-called ?quantum gases?, are achieved when cooled to near absolute zero, but this is technically challenging. Recent work, though, has demonstrated that internal quantum coherence can persist even in thermal gases whose temperatures are well above those required to create a quantum gas. The first goal of this project is to determine the limiting conditions for which quantum coherence is preserved in these thermal gases. As such, it will probe the boundary between the classical and quantum regimes and may aid in the development of low-cost quantum technologies. The second goal is to investigate such a gas as it transitions from a thermal cloud to a quantum gas. Depending on the conditions of the experiment, the quantum properties can be either suppressed or enhanced, affecting the complexity of computations and the precision of measurements. The third goal of this project is to integrate quantum science research into undergraduate education. If successful, this will provide a model to make quantum science research more accessible to undergraduate-only institutions, providing enhanced learning opportunities to underrepresented groups in physics.<br/> <br/>The experimental research program will measure ultracold atomic spinor gases with three main goals.

All-optical trapping of spinor gases will be utilized to probe the spinor dynamics of samples as a function of temperature. A thermal gas will be coherently prepared with the desired initial spin state, and the resulting population oscillations will be measured through absorption imaging of the magnetic sublevels. Second, the project will investigate coherent spin-changing collisions in the temperature regime as a thermal gas transitions to a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the limiting cases are well-understood, there is currently no theoretical model to describe this intermediate regime. It has been argued that spin-locking between the thermal and Bose-condensed components, for example, can lead to either an enhancement or suppression of the coherence of the thermal cloud. The loss of coherence limits the complexity of computation in quantum information systems and the precision of measurements. Experimental studies will provide needed measurements to develop accurate theoretical models. Third, the project will integrate education and research in quantum physics with reduced technical requirements suitable for primarily undergraduate institutions, providing enhanced learning opportunities for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will help scientists observe as many gravitational waves as possible while learning as much as possible about the waves' sources. Using supercomputers, the PI and students will calculate the gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars, to expedite and respond to LIGO's observations; they will also model the most important source of noise limiting LIGO's reach.

Despite its importance, we still lack a predictive theory of star formation that has been tested over a broad range of environments. To test competing theories of star formation, we must extend beyond the neighborhood of our Sun. In this program, the team will study how stars form in extreme environments found in the Galaxy's most massive star clusters and at its center. Studying these distant, crowded, and dusty young star clusters requires high-fidelity images at infrared wavelengths. The team will precisely measure each star's motion in the sky to separate stars in the cluster, which move together, from contaminating field stars, which move more randomly. They will compare the young stars in these extreme environments to those found in our Sun's neighborhood, which will provide a deeper understanding of the physics of how stars form. The Ph.D. students working on this research will also share these and other results with undergraduate students in Hawaii by participating in education training and a practical teaching experience that emphasizes scientific inquiry and diverse learning styles. <br/><br/>This investigation will concentrate on a small sample of massive young clusters throughout the Milky Way and determine how the properties of the stars and clusters change in different environments.  The team will use infrared observations from the largest ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics and from the Hubble space telescope. They have developed a suite of analysis tools that deliver some of the most precise star motions ever achieved at infrared wavelengths, which is essential when studying these star clusters. The team will measure the structure and dynamics of the clusters as well as the distribution of star masses. They will also compare the clusters in our sample with each other, with star clusters in the Sun's neighborhood, and with theoretical simulations. Taken together, this study of massive young clusters will provide powerful constraints on theories of star and cluster formation. Graduate students working on this research will also participate in an intensive professional development program through the Hawaii chapter of the Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators, where they will train in inquiry-based teaching methods and diverse learning styles. They will gain practical experience by teaching in Hawaii-based venues that target under-served groups, including Native Hawaiians, at the undergraduate level. Both the scientific results and new inquiry activities developed through this program will be disseminated broadly to astronomers to multiply their impact."

The Milky Way is our most important reference for understanding the hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe around us. It is the only galaxy where we can observe individual stars, like our sun, in detail. However, there remain fundamental unanswered questions about the Milky Way and the structure we see today. We still do not know the mass of our Galaxy to within a factor of two. The most accepted model for how galaxies form is that galaxies grow by merging with smaller satellite galaxies.  The investigators will check this model by optical observations of ancient stars in the outer parts of the Milky Way, called the Halo. Using optical spectra, the investigators will measure the abundance of elements in these stars, which can tell us about the original, smaller, galaxies in which those old stars were born. When combined with other observations of these stars, the investigators will be able to answer basic questions about the history of our own Milky Way galaxy.<br/><br/>The deep spectroscopy of stars in the galactic halo add line-of-sight velocity, chemical abundance information and improved distance estimates to the proper motions for these stars.   The investigators' observations will determine the three components of the velocity, three components of each star's position in the Galaxy and a critical seventh dimension elemental abundances of the star. The spectroscopy and proper motions will be measured for main sequence stars as distant as 90 kpc. In total, this program will obtain spectra for 450 main sequence halo stars over 11 different lines of sight in the halo. These data contain unique information about the growth of the Milky Way's stellar halo and accretion of satellites, which will be used to reconstruct the mass accretion history of our Galaxy. Furthermore, the full phase-space information will be used to measure the total mass of the Milky Way; an important, yet poorly constrained, astrophysical quantity. <br/><br/>The transverse velocity information from the investigator's proper motion data will be used to measure the velocity anisotropy of distant halo stars. The velocity anisotropy is a major source of systematic uncertainty in our knowledge of the total mass of the Milky Way. The investigators will search the multi-dimensional data for substructure in the distant halo, especially substructure from low luminosity satellites. The tidal remnants of these dwarf galaxies have been hidden from previous searches. Measuring the number of low-luminosity halo progenitors will test models for the connection between dark matter sub-halos and dwarf satellite galaxies. This is an important consistency test of the predictions of cosmological galaxy formation models. From the three dimensions of velocity, the investigators will measure the orbits of the progenitor systems that were accreted into the halo. From the metallicities, the luminosities of the progenitors can be estimated. The abundances of the alpha-elements will be measured for the brighter stars in the sample and used to estimate the accretion times of the satellites. The distributions of orbits, accretion times and luminosities of the progenitors defines the accretion history of our Galaxy's halo. <br/><br/>Their outreach plan includes bringing in high school students via the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program (SIP).  High school SIP interns work with their mentors on research projects, and past interns have presented papers at Astronomical Society meetings and have been co-authors on refereed publications. The two graduate students will mentor the students in collaboration with the investigators.  This will give the graduate students experience in non-classroom teaching. Graduate students will develop a Python-based research methods module for high school students that draws from the research program. The investigators will work to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through their participation in programs like SIP, Research Methods, the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science and the Project for Inmate Education in the Santa Cruz county jail."

These particles, also known as aerosols, make the air hazy (reduce visibility) causing potential problems navigating on the roads, at sea or in the sky. There is also significant evidence that breathing such particles is harmful to human health. Generally, about half of the mass of these particles is composed of molecules comprised of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen (oxygenated hydrocarbons). There is recent evidence that some of these oxygenated hydrocarbons form in the air via the combination of two smaller molecules, a process known as accretion. To learn what promotes this type of chemical combination reaction, laboratory and computer calculations are used to examine the efficiency for different chemicals found in the atmosphere.  This research is important for developing an underlying understanding of air quality but also for biology, human toxicology, soil chemistry and the preservation of artwork.  Students and staff from the Wennberg and Stoltz groups are heavily engaged in bringing science to the public. Atmospheric chemistry provides an opening for conversation and interaction as citizens of Los Angeles have direct experience with poor air quality. These outreach activities are performed both on campus and in the local schools. On campus,<br/>for example, the science program is conducted with local elementary schools and pre-K children in an outdoor lab. The research team works closely with the Benjamin Franklin Elementary School in Glendale, CA to collaborate with the teachers in designing experiments that enhance the science- and math-based learning curriculum in which the students are engaged.<br/><br/>Reactions of organic peroxy radicals with other peroxy radicals are thought to produce much larger molecules via accretion. These larger molecules have a much lower vapor pressure and can condense to form aerosol. Little is known about what controls the rates at which these accretion products form. This study examines the hypothesis that weak bonding interactions in the initially produced complex of the two peroxy radicals determine the efficiency of this chemistry. The rates of this oxidative reaction are studied for a diverse set of organic substrates. The team synthesizes compounds that are thought to characterize these accretion products to confirm their identity. The comprehensive laboratory studies are complemented with computational chemistry through a collaboration with Professor Kjaergaard at the University of Copenhagen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From the basic chemical bonds that hold molecules together to the bulk properties of macroscopic matter, electrons are largely responsible for the chemical makeup and physical properties of liquids and solids.  Quantum mechanics has informed us of the true nature of matter at the small scale of the atom, but accurately representing even the simplest molecule is challenging.  Still, there is much to be learned from studying matter at the most fundamental level, including a better understanding of the consequences of electron correlation that govern so much of how matter behaves at all length scales.  Electron correlation goes beyond the fact that electrons repel each other; electrons continually notice each other in fundamental ways, like spin interactions, and learning about those interactions better informs us of the fundamental construction of our universe.  Double photoionization studies, where a photon of sufficient energy can remove two electrons from a material in a single event, directly probes electron correlation.  This research will advance precise methods to describe double photoionization in molecules with many electrons, like water (H2O). The purpose is to better understand electron correlation in these more-complicated targets and gain further general insights into the fundamental interactions of electrons in molecules.  This understanding, once developed, informs multiple technological applications involving chemistry and materials that are essential to a high-tech society.<br/><br/>This project will investigate electronic correlation for two electrons removed by single-photon absorptions (double photoionization)  for simple molecules with more than two electrons in order to better understand the ways that multi-electron targets are influenced by additional complexity (beyond H2).  Theoretical calculations describing these events from first principles will be applied to targets with many electrons that continue to interact with the fully correlated electrons before, during and after the photoionization event.  Theoretical support is needed to help inform and understand recent experimental measurements of double photoionization of water.  It is hoped that this project can further elucidate the broader consequences of how all of the electrons bound to a molecule can affect those that will be moved into the continuum and how consequences of molecular symmetry and electronic structure impact the outgoing electrons from a molecular environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By colliding protons at the  highest-ever energy in a controlled environment, we are learning how  symmetries are broken in nature and how the universe evolved from the earliest moments after the Big Bang to the present state billions of years later. The goal of particle physics is to understand the basic laws of how fundamental particles, like electrons and quarks, interact with one another and how their collective dynamics shape the universe.  Experimental results provided by the LHC are the essential ingredient to sort through all the possible models that could describe the universe and focus on those which give us a deeper and better  understanding of what we observe.  In addition to the LHC, the  experimental program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at  Brookhaven National Laboratory probes the early-universe behavior of quarks and gluons, which formed a hot dense plasma before cooling as the universe expanded, leading to the creation of protons, neutrons and in turn atoms and molecules. Here, the relevant theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is needed with ever-higher precision to predict how this transition occurred.  As part of this project, Professors Hetrick and Holland will investigate new physics models which potentially elucidate the properties of the Higgs boson, whose relatively light mass is an unexplained mystery.  They will also study QCD and similar models, using computer simulations for better insight into strongly-interacting systems.  This work is therefore aligned with the national interest in that it reinforces the progress of fundamental science in the United States.   This work also has a significant broader impact, giving undergraduate students at the University of the Pacific an opportunity to work on modern-day research, such as learning numerical  simulation techniques. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Holland will be studying strongly-interacting composite Higgs models, which postulate a new gauge force analogous to QCD. In such theories, the Higgs boson emerges as a bound state, much like a pion forms via the strong binding of quarks. Such models could explain why the Higgs boson is relatively light if the new gauge theory has near-conformal behavior.  This leads to predictions of additional bound states that should be observed at the LHC, which are now reaching to the level of being detected or ruled out.   Like QCD, such models require numerical lattice simulations on supercomputers in order to make reliable predictions.  Professor Hetrick will be working on an alternate idea in which the properties of the Higgs boson emerge from a higher-dimensional theory via the Hosotani mechanism, where particular boundary conditions break the symmetry.  Again, numerical computations are needed to test such theories and compare them against current experimental results.  Both Professors Holland and Hetrick will also be studying properties of QCD as well, such as how the theory simplifies as the symmetry is increased, as well as providing technical support for the sharing of numerical resources across the international research community."

One powerful route forward towards realization in the laboratory combines well-understood systems to force electrons into novel states of matter that might otherwise be difficult to realize. The PI's research will pursue this line of attack to explore a variety of engineered systems, with applications ranging from quantum computing to tabletop simulations of black-hole physics and quantum chaos. The results will help in bridging novel theories with tangible experiments, while also streamlining the realization of new technologies.  <br/><br/>The research will be complemented by a multifaceted education and outreach program.  Training of undergraduates and graduate students in modern theoretical research topics will comprise a major component.  Research advances will be broadly disseminated, to specialists and non-specialists alike, through research articles, seminars, commentaries, blog posts, special summer schools, and courses.

The project will specifically investigate the following areas: <br/><br/>i) Nanowire-based realizations of interacting Majorana-fermion models that exhibit profound connections to black holes, chaos, and holography.  Viewing the problem from this hardware perspective has the potential to reveal new insights that further link high energy, quantum information, and condensed matter physics.  <br/><br/>ii) Plausible avenues toward new non-Abelian phases in topological-insulator surfaces and quantum-Hall systems.  This research will begin to bridge the gulf between theory and experiment in these areas while also deepening connections between topological insulators and quantum-Hall systems that have recently come to light. <br/><br/>iii) Practical issues for existing and upcoming experiments pursuing topological quantum computing.  Research here includes simulating experimental protocols that probe fusion of non-Abelian anyons, and developing transport theories that will guide experiments towards realizing Majorana zero modes, parafermionic generalizations, and graphene-based topological insulators. These activities will support ongoing efforts at stabilizing non-Abelian anyons in engineered architectures and will help quantify their utility for quantum-information applications. <br/><br/>The research will be complemented by a multifaceted education and outreach program.

Motility, i.e., the ability to produce controlled directional motion of a cell as a whole, is of paramount importance for the cell's ability to survive and explore its environment. Just like man-made machines use motors to enable them to move, cells use ATP-powered molecular motors to generate mechanical work. A much less explored, yet surprisingly powerful motility pathway involves propulsion-powered by osmotic energy, in which a cell directs water channels to defined regions of its membrane, and uses the resulting water fluxes in presence of external, even uniform, osmotic gradient to propel itself like a mini-rocket through aqueous environment.  This project will explore the fundamental physical principles of this process by recapitulating the key elements of this motility apparatus in a model synthetic system comprised from large enclosed proto-cellular membrane compartments- giant unilamellar vesicles- and efficient synthetic water channels- carbon nanotube porins. Precisely controlled phase segregation in the vesicle shell will drive the water channels to a particular vesicle region and generate asymmetric propulsion. This project will explore the possibility of generating sustained propulsion by using multiple recharge cycles, as well as explore the effects of crowding and emergent collective behavior in the ensembles of these osmotically-propelled proto-cells. In addition, this project will provide research, training and educational opportunities to high school and undergraduate students for a better understanding of modern biomaterials research.  In particular, the project will offer opportunities in biomimetic materials research through targeted outreach efforts and presentations to K-12 STEM summer program participants in California Central Valley region.  It will also enable participation by undergraduate researchers through the Vertically Integrated Program (https://vip.ucdavis.edu), which allows them to work in single labs for several quarters.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Cell migration is ubiquitous in biology. During motility, cells acquire a spatial asymmetry - a polarized morphology characterized by a clear distinction between the cell front and the rear - allowing them to convert energy-dissipative intracellular forces, generated in response to environmental stimuli, into net movement. In addition to ATP-consuming cytoskeleton remodeling to drive polarity and cell motility, an alternate process involves the emergence of cell polarity through active positioning of membrane channels, which in conjunction with asymmetric water fluxes under osmotic gradients generate a net propulsive force. This EAGER proposal seeks to recapitulate this essential mechanism into synthetic giant vesicles towards developing design principles for a broad general class of far-from-equilibrium materials that move, flow, or swim in response to changes in their environment. The investigators articulate a high-risk, high-reward experiments that test their central hypothesis that directional fluxes of water across vesicular compartments facilitated by asymmetric spatial distribution of highly-efficient water channels (aquaporins or carbon nanotube porins) can isothermally transduce osmotic energy into a vectorial propulsion. To address this hypothesis, three aims will be pursued: (1) Preparation and characterization of water-channel embedding vesicular compartments that exhibit cell-like polarity; (2) demonstration of self-propulsion of polarized giant vesicles in response to imposed osmotic gradients; and (3) study emergent, cooperative behaviors in populations of closely interacting, motile giant vesicles. The broader technical impact of this project benefits from a combination of concepts from the fields of soft matter, membrane biophysics, and bio-inspired materials that address fundamental interdisciplinary questions surrounding the design of model protocellular configurations, biomimicry, novel principles for material synthesis, and understanding the rules of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of hard materials to tools, technology, and the societies they sustain is so self-evident that it is common archaeological practice to name pre-historic human eras by the tooling resources employed, i.e. Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc. In the modern age, superhard materials are needed for high-performance cutting tools, especially for preventing tool damage when cutting advanced ceramics and superalloys. Considering the contributions of the machining industries to the global economy, it is clear that a new generation of cutting tools could have a significant impact worldwide; the world market for superhard materials is projected to reach over $20 billion within the next 5 years. Unfortunately, very few superhard materials exist and those that do (such as diamond) need to be synthesized under extreme pressure and heat, thus making them too expensive for many applications. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the research team is developing the next generation of superhard materials than can be produced at ambient pressure - superhard metal borides. Training the next generation of materials chemists and bringing the excitement of this project to the general public will provide broader impact. The Principal Investigator serves as the faculty advisor to the Student Members of the American Chemical Society at UCLA. This position has been successfully used to reach many middle and high school students through visits to their schools, fostering a love for chemistry for both undergraduates and K-12 students. The co-Principal Investigator is actively developing new ways to teach science with high school teachers through her position as the Director of Outreach for the California NanoSystems Institute. Each graduate student involved in this proposal helps with outreach projects and mentors undergraduates. The undergraduates will assist the graduate students in research, thereby increasing the future graduate student pool in materials chemistry.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Ten years ago, the Principal Investigators suggested that new superhard materials that could be synthesized at atmospheric pressure (unlike diamond or cubic BN) could be compositionally designed by incorporating covalent bonding into high valence electron density metals. The covalent bonds prevent shear and the electron density adds incompressibility. Transition metal borides exemplify these parameters by providing high valence electron density, multiple boron-boron covalent bonds, and unique crystallographic structures. This idea was first demonstrated with osmium diboride (incompressible), and then with rhenium diboride and tungsten tetraboride (both of which are superhard and incompressible). With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the research team refines and expands on these materials by focusing on structure and bonding motifs. The superhard design toolkit can be enlarged by studying the mechanical properties of new tungsten tetraboride solid-solutions to form dodecaboride-type structures, increasing electron density through doping with iron, and by examining the lower borides of tungsten, which complement the 3-D boron network of tungsten tetraboride by containing 0-D, 1-D, and 2-D boron structures. This family of compounds serves as a model system for understanding how the nature of B-B and B-metal bonds affect hardness. Each composition can be studied using high-pressure radial diffraction to obtain lattice plane specific information about failure and slip. The eventual goal is the development of a third design parameter to explicitly elucidate the structures and bonding motifs that should most improve macroscopic mechanical properties based on microscopic bonding. In this way, the Principal Investigators hope to uncover additional fundamental design rules that can be used to rationally synthesize new members of an increasingly complex family of ultra-hard yet easy to synthesize materials."

What is not widely known is that these electrical circuits are largely contained in small semiconductor chips, that the dimensions of components of those circuits are approaching the size of atoms, and that the circuits are produced in machines containing the fourth state of matter ? plasma.  Plasmas are ionized gases that can produce chemically reactive environments, and are composed of a mix of positive ions, negative ions, electrons and neutral atoms and molecules.  Low pressure plasmas are essential to the fabrication of microelectronics devices by delivering fluxes of radicals and ions to a semiconductor wafer.  These radicals and ions then etch (remove material), deposit (add material) and passivate (change surface composition) the wafer surface through many fabrication steps to create the devices.  A voltage is also applied to the substrate holding the wafer to accelerate ions to high energies in order to activate these on-wafer processes. An important type of plasma used in microelectronics fabrication is an electronegative plasma in which the density of negative ions is much larger than electrons.  These plasmas are very sensitive to operating conditions (such as power, pressure and gas mixture), with instabilities often.  The quality of the devices being fabricated are sensitive to these instabilities and so tighter control of the plasma process is becoming more important.  Pulsing the plasma (turning the power on-and-off) and pulsing the acceleration voltage results in higher precision components with smaller dimensions, whiich translates into more powerful electronics devices. Although pulsing provides many advantages, pulsing also produces instabilities.  In order to optimize the plasma processes that are used to manufacture microelectronics devices, these instabilities in electronegative plasmas must be understood, controlled and, if possible, prevented.<br/><br/>In this project, experimental and computational investigations of pulsed electronegative plasmas are being conducted for the type of inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) that are used for microelectronics fabrication. The goal is to quantify the interactions between the pulsed sources that produce the plasma and the pulsed biases that accelerate ions into the wafer, the onset of instabilities, and methods to control those instabilities.  This investigation is being conducted in collaboration with our GOALI partner Lam Research Corp.  We are making 3-dimensional, time dependent measurements of electron density, temperature, plasma potential, current density, magnetic fields and ion energy distributions using laser and electrical probe diagnostics.  First principles modeling is being used to investigate fundamental plasma transport during pulsed transients, electrostatic-to-electromagnetic (E-H) transitions and interactions of pulsed sources and biases.  The end result will be a greatly improved understanding of pulsed electronegative plasmas of the type used for materials processing, with this understanding being rapidly translated to practice by our GOALI partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These futuristic ideas are currently science fiction, but if we have any hope of creating these amazing technologies, we need to begin today. This collaborative project seeks to explore the fundamental underpinnings of the materials needed for such applications. Specifically, in order to design any of these futuristic devices, we need to have materials that are self-powered and assembled hierarchically from energy-using building blocks. Luckily, many biological systems, such as cells, plants, and humans, are already capable of sensing their environment and responding by moving, changing shape, or releasing chemicals. The basic building blocks of these biological ?systems? are enzymes, nanoscale machines made of protein that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In order to dissect and begin to create an understanding of how enzymes can animate matter, our team will use enzymes to power new synthetic materials at the nanoscale to microscale. In the future, these nanoscale materials can be assembled themselves to create new larger scale active materials. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The scientific objective of this project is to understand the physics of synthetic active materials powered by enzymes. The research team combines expertise in DNA nanotechnology, enzyme kinetics, single-particle tracking, and sensitive force measurements to address the following objectives: (1) The team uses DNA origami to design, create, and characterize a suite of active particles, driven by enzyme catalysis, with programmable size, shape, flexibility, and location of propulsive enzymes. This objective addresses a need to create new nano- to mesoscale active particles and uses these particles to understand the mechanisms governing enhanced motility. (2) The team characterizes the properties of an active bath of enzyme-driven particles via the fluctuation spectrum, dissipation of energy, and the ability of an active bath to propel passive particles to extract work from noise. A combined study of the single-particle motility and the active fluctuations that emerge from collections of active particles will reveal a wealth of new information, including the mechanisms of enhanced transport of active particles, as well as a non-equilibrium statistical mechanical description of active fluctuations. The importance of this approach lies in the potential to specify the microscopic details of active particles, like their size, shape, and flexibility, and then to discover how these attributes alter the single-particle and collective behaviors.<br/><br/>This DMR grant supports research to understand the physics of synthetic active materials powered by enzymes with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) and Biomaterials (BMAT) Programs in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the ability of laboratory scientists to control the self-assembly of proteins or to use them as synthetic building blocks to generate new functions has been severely limited. The overarching goal of the proposed research program is to overcome this limitation by developing new protein design tools based on metal coordination chemistry and DNA nanotechnology. In one project goal, the PI?s group will construct complex, cage-like protein architectures which can ultimately be used to encapsulate and release molecular cargo in a stimuli-dependent fashion. In a second project goal, they will exploit the programmability of DNA self-assembly to generate multicomponent protein architectures and elucidate the complex energy landscape of protein-DNA interactions. In terms of the broader impacts, the proposed effort will not only provide fundamental insights into biological self-assembly processes, but also lend access to novel protein-based functionalities and materials with potential applications in bio/nano-technology and basic sciences (e.g., separations, catalysis, delivery, sensing, X-ray or electron-diffraction-based structure determination). Due to its highly interdisciplinary nature, this project will provide an expansive training ground for graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers, and help them tackle complex scientific problems later in their careers. As a new educational activity, the PI?s lab will start hosting STEM activities designed for Junior Reserve Officers? Training Corps from San Diego-area high schools. These activities collectively will enhance the students? understanding of proteins as biomolecules and their self-assembly/crystallization as well as their novel uses as building blocks for novel catalysts and materials. Importantly, the students will be exposed to daily activities that are taking place in a research laboratory. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>While natural evolution has produced remarkable protein-based machines and materials over the course of billions of years, it has only explored an infinitesimally small fraction of the design/self-assembly space that could be achieved with the available protein folds. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to have the ability to craft ordered protein assemblies from scratch using building blocks of choice, which would greatly broaden the structural and functional scope of naturally existing protein assemblies and bioinspired materials. Previous findings from the PI?s indicate that the tools and principles of supramolecular/inorganic/polymer chemistry and protein engineering can be combined in new ways to address outstanding issues in protein self-assembly and to create novel biomaterials. In the proposed research, these efforts will be expanded under two Objectives. Under Objective 1, the PI?s group will expand their inorganic chemical toolkit through the use of unnatural metal chelating functionalities and combine them with computational design to access complex, stimuli-responsive polyhedral architectures that were previously out of reach. Objective 2 will exploit the programmability of DNA self-assembly to generate heteromeric/multicomponent protein architectures and to better understand the complex energy landscape of protein-DNA co-assembly. The Objectives will take advantage of two protein building blocks (cytochrome cb562 and Rop) to access a multitude of oligomeric and polymeric protein assemblies in a modular fashion, probe their structures and structural dynamics using state-of-the-art tools (e.g., cryoEM, X-ray diffraction and scattering), and examine their emergent functions (e.g., nucleic acid encapsulation).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At what scale, then, does ""the arrow of time"" start to form?  Previous NSF funded research in the PI's group opened a new experimental window on dissipative processes occurring in the deformation of big molecules.

Hydration layer dynamics, explored by nano-rheology, is also the starting point of a new, dynamic understanding of kosmotropic (order inducing) and chaotropic agents, a physical chemistry topic which this research develops.

Nano-rheology, invented in the PI's lab, allows the measurement of the stress - strain relations for a folded, native enzyme with sub-Angstrom resolution and at different frequencies. Through recent improvements, the method now allows accurate measurements of the phase of the mechanical response, as well as the amplitude, and thus gives direct access to the dissipation.

Alkenes (molecules that contain a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) bond) are one class of feedstocks that are ubiquitous, inexpensive, and available on large scale. While alkenes have been long appreciated as important starting materials for the synthesis of valuable substances, at present it remains difficult for chemists to convert alkenes into many types of desirable products. In this project, Dr. Keary M. Engle is developing new reactions to fill this gap. Specifically, by using small quantities of an inexpensive, non-toxic, and earth-abundant nickel catalyst, Dr. Engle's reactions are allowing alkenes to be used as lynchpins to connect to two additional reactants, allowing for the formation of otherwise difficult to form carbon-carbon single bonds bonds between the reactants and the alkenes. Dr. Engle and his research team are highly engaged in outreach activities that are synergistic with his research in order to promote engagement with science, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines among diverse populations. Specifically, these efforts include internships for high school and undergraduate students, open-access sharing of research-relevant information for scientists and for the general public, and implementation of active-learning strategies for classroom teaching. This research project helps to improve the sustainability and innovation of the chemical industry while increasing the technical workforce of the United States.<br/><br/>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Keary M. Engle of The Scripps Research Institute is developing a toolkit of nickel-catalyzed, three-component, cross-coupling reactions to convert alkenes into structurally complex products that have potential utility in academia and industry. In particular, the Engle lab is developing transformations that strategically employ proximal chelating functional groups to control the key elementary steps and enhance selectivity for a desired 1,2-difunctionalization of alkenes. Detailed mechanistic studies combining reaction kinetics, organometallic synthesis, and density functional theory (DFT) are being carried out to elucidate the reactivity of key organonickel intermediates involved in these catalytic processes. By drawing on these mechanistic insights, Dr. Engle is translating existing auxiliary-based approaches to new strategies that take advantage of native functional groups for directivity, in order to improve the efficiency, utility, and atom-economy of such reactions. A diverse collection of reaction partners are being examined, including those capable of forming challenging C(sp3)-C(sp3) and C(sp3)-heteroatom linkages.

Aerosol particles in marine environments play a critical role in controlling cloud formation and lifetime, atmospheric chemical composition, surface temperature and precipitation patterns, and human and ecosystem health. CAICE research is providing new insights into aerosol chemistry which will enable more robust predictions on the impact of aerosol particles on air quality, climate, and the hydrologic cycle.  In addition to illustrating the central role of chemistry in environmental processes that impacts research disciplines spanning from physical oceanography to marine biology, CAICE is actively developing new experimental and computational tools with applications in chemical research involving soft materials, nanomaterials, small sensor development, and colloidal science. Beyond their research experience, students involved in CAICE receive interdisciplinary training in research ethics, effective science communication, and entrepreneurialism, equipping them with the required tools to address future grand challenges in science. CAICE research is shared via a spectrum of educational and outreach activities, including: 1) science communication and outreach through storytelling, 2) CAICE-developed CLEAR (Collaborative Learning in Environmental and Aerosol Research) particle counters used in formal and informal education, and 3) general public outreach events in close collaboration with the UC San Diego's Birch Aquarium and other public venues.<br/><br/>The primary objective of CAICE involves developing molecular level insight into chemical processes occurring in the marine atmosphere. CAICE studies are investigating how chemical heterogeneity, morphology, phase, and molecular composition, at the individual aerosol particle level, control the properties and reactivity of marine aerosols. To achieve these goals, CAICE utilizes a unique experimental ocean-atmosphere interaction facility designed to bring the full complexity of the ocean-atmosphere system directly into the laboratory to allow investigations into aerosol formation and chemical transformations in a controlled setting. These signature experiments serve to guide molecular level investigations through the distillation of chemical complexity and the identification of molecular building blocks that can be used to replicate the complex atmospheric interfaces.  To accomplish these goals, CAICE research is divided into three research themes: 1) Production and characterization of marine aerosol particles: Replicating the chemical complexity of the ocean-atmosphere system in the laboratory, 2) Chemical reactions at environmental interfaces: Gas and aerosol transformations, 3) Molecular level impacts of marine aerosols on water uptake and ice nucleation. Through highly collaborative research, CAICE is developing a fundamental and chemically accurate picture of marine aerosol chemistry that will enable accurate predictions of the impact of marine aerosols on our environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Supernova (SN) explosions are not spherical, but rather geometrically complex phenomena, whose aspherical structures cause variations in observed characteristics over time as the explosion evolves. A research collaboration between the University of Denver (DU) and San Diego State University (SDSU) uses an observational technique called spectropolarimetry to provide detailed three-dimensional information about SNe, probing spatial scales that cannot be resolved through direct imaging from earth or even from space. Spectropolarimetry combines detection of the polarization of light from a supernova with measurement of the spectrum of that light.  This information reveals the changing densities, temperatures, and illumination patterns in the ejecta over time; and gives clues to the explosion mechanisms and the nature of progenitor systems.   The project will advance the future of discovery by training students in these types of observations and modeling. It will also contribute to the training of a future diverse STEM community. The investigators will develop a hands-on learning module demonstrating the concept of polarization, for direct integration into two activities: the DU SciTech camp, co-directed by the DU principal investigator (PI), which brings middle-school girls of color to campus for a week-long discovery-based STEM camp each year, and also the extensive outreach activities led by the SDSU PI. <br/><br/>The scientists will use data collected from 2011 to 2018 by the Supernova Spectropolarimetry (SNSPOL) Project, the largest existing database of spectropolarimetric observations of SNe of all types, which includes 106 SNe of all types, with 50 observed at 3+ epochs.  They will interpret these data with new state-of-the-art modeling techniques. Observational surveys are discovering supernovae and related transients at an ever-increasing rate. The project will broaden the scientific impact of these discoveries by greatly expanding the existing catalog of SNe examined with spectropolarimetry and quantitatively establishing the common signatures of each SN type. The multi-epoch observations in the SNSPOL database trace each SN?s evolution as the photosphere recedes, probing ever deeper into the ejecta and revealing clues to the very nature of the explosion itself. Extracting and analyzing the most salient spectropolarimetric features from these data will make the wealth of information they contain available to future researchers. The results will build a fuller understanding of the 3D nature of SNe of all types and form a key discriminant for stellar explosion models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanoparticles are tiny particles that contain thousands of atoms. While they are much larger than chemical molecules, which contain only a few atoms, they are still much smaller than solid materials that are large enough to see with the naked eye, containing trillions of atoms. Nanoscale materials are unique because they have sizes intermediate between molecules and solids, but sometimes have properties not easily predicted by averaging the two size extremes.  Professor Yarmoff uses specialized characterization methods to investigate how the electronic properties of metal nanoparticles are affected by defects in a solid support material.  Measurements are made as a function of nanoparticle size, the number of intentionally produced defects in the support material and exposure to gases that ""stick"" (or adsorb) to the clusters. The research has significant broader impact in the field of surface chemistry. Learning how to control the electronic properties of nanoparticle will facilitate their use in numerous applications such as electronics, supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar power generation and catalysis. This research project impacts knowledge in basic science, technology and the environment while directly contributing to the education of the university's diverse student body. Graduate and undergraduate students obtain hands-on laboratory experience in a field that is at the forefront of modern research, while local high school teachers benefit from a summer program that includes laboratory experience. <br/><br/>In this project professor Yarmoff studies how the local electrostatic potential (LEP) of supported metal nanoclusters is affected by (1) the intentional introduction of defects in the substrate, (2) adsorption of various adatoms onto the nanoclusters, and (3) the manner in which defects in the substrate act to modify any subsequent adsorption. Although there has been a proliferation of research on metal nanoclusters, there are still many unanswered questions and no consensus as to the underlying mechanisms responsible for their catalytic enhancement and other properties. There is a strong body of evidence, however, that the charge state of metal nanoclusters is a critical factor in their electronic and chemical behaviors. Supported metal nanoclusters are produced on oxide and fluoride substrates by direct deposition and buffer layer assisted growth (BLAG).  Professor Yarmoff uses a novel form of low energy ion scattering (LEIS), which relies on the neutralization of scattered 1-5 keV alkali ions, to monitor the surface LEP and charge state of the nanoclusters. Incorporation of intentionally produced defects and adsorption of small molecules are used to tune the amount of charge localized on each cluster. The research has significant broader impact on the field; these studies provide an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of solid-state materials while developing methods to control them, which will facilitate their use in numerous applications such as nanoelectronics, supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar power generation and catalysis. The research program also has broader impacts in education and outreach since it directly contributes to the education of the University of California-Riverside's diverse body of graduate and undergraduate students through hands-on laboratory experience in a field at the forefront of modern research.

In 2010, a group of scientists discovered that nearly instantaneous full densification can occur (within five seconds) for certain ceramics when a high-level voltage or current pass through a compact of these ceramic powders. Thus, this rapid densification technique was named flash sintering. Since then, flash sintering has become one of the most promising techniques for ceramics processing. However, the mechanisms for this rapid sintering process are unclear; this project attempts to reveal the underlying reasons. The experimental work in this study is complemented by computational modeling, enabling a more comprehensive understanding on the rapid densification mechanisms of flash sintering of ceramic powders. This new knowledge then serves as fundamental guidance to extend the flash sintering technique into a wider range of ceramic materials. Graduate and undergraduate students (including minority and other underrepresented students) are being trained in mechanical engineering and materials science and engineering for careers in academia or high-technology manufacturing. Virtual reality technology is used to provide an immersive and interactive teaching and learning environment for materials sciences topics, and helps to educate a workforce capable of using adaptive new technologies in a rapidly changing society.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The technique, flash sintering, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly densify powder compacts of ceramic materials. In this technique, an applied electric field initiates a ""flash"" event and sintering occurs within a few seconds (at a threshold temperature for a given applied electric field). Although flash sintering has been observed in a variety of ceramic systems, the exact effects of electric field or current on enhancing the densification rate and influencing the microstructure evolution remain elusive, apart from the known thermal runaway Joule heating ohmic mechanisms. A series of experimental and theoretical modeling research activities are being carried out on ionic ceramic systems to clarify the thermal and non-thermal factors of electric field in the flash sintering process. In situ nanoscale imaging is used to observe the flash sintering process of yttrium-stabilized zirconia ceramic systems as a function of applied electric field, providing insights into the flash sintering mechanism. In addition, multiscale atom-to-continuum modeling is being used to simulate the flash sintering process of ionic ceramics in the presence of an electric field. The modeling is revealing the rapid densification mechanisms of flash sintering of ionic ceramics at the atomic level. Students are being educated to become experts in the practice of experimental and computational aspects of ceramic sintering technologies. As a result, graduates are being well prepared to create sustainable engineering solutions to complex problems, and thereby contributing to the cutting-edge of science and technology of ceramics processing and materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adapting these processes to the ""greenest"" solvent - water - remains a challenge. This project to be conducted by Professor Julius Rebek at The Scripps Research Institute uses synthetic, container-shape, molecules for reactions in water. The ""containers"" act as nanovessels that show robust stability and can be used and re-used over a wide range of conditions. A broader impact of this research is the benefit of developing sustainable chemistry.  Another impact is the discovery of new molecules for use in water-proof coatings and nanomachines.  Postdoctoral researchers benefit from learning how research projects translate from chemical discovery to applications in new materials.<br/><br/>The chemistry of molecules confined to small containers - nanoscale compounds known as cavitands - is a relatively new undertaking. This research takes advantage of an early discovery that long-chain organic compounds assume unusual, folded shapes within the cavitand's space. The folded shapes, induced by hydrophobic forces, push the substrate's ends together and promote large-ring cyclization processes. The cavitands act as templates. Folding also blocks some sites on the chain and exposes others to reactions with agents in the aqueous medium. The blocking action promises new chemical pathways for remote carbon-hydrogen activation in functionalization reactions that typically lead to 5 or 6-membered ring sizes. Functional groups that are remote in extended molecules are brought into proximity when folded in cavitands. The functions no longer act independently and can affect each other's reactivity; showing the consequences of this ""entanglement"" is one of the basic science novelties expected from this research. The practical consequences may include synthetic methods for access to molecules that cannot be made by conventional means.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A cell's fate -- differentiation into a specific biological cell type -- is determined by several interlinked factors: cell-intrinsic mechanisms, signals from the local environment outside the cell, and messages the cell receives from other cells. Despite unprecedented amounts of experimental data at single-cell resolution, how cell fate is determined remains not fully understood. Challenges to development of a theory arise from information crosstalk at multiple temporal and spatial scales, as well as from the need to mine, integrate, and model the new single-cell ""big data"" derived from experimental measurements.  To address these challenges and to establish a founding paradigm for multiscale cell fate research, a team of mathematical scientists and biologists will develop novel mathematical, computational, and statistical tools to analyze cell fate through a multiscale lens. The Center will carry out a coherent program for community building, interdisciplinary training and workforce development, and diversity enhancement to expand the mathematics-biology interface and to promote the convergence of mathematical and biological sciences. The Center will produce cohorts of interconnected young researchers and will nationally seed the next generation's laboratories. The knowledge gained will create new multiscale mathematics for analyzing big data and modeling complex systems, with broader applications to regenerative medicine, embryonic development, and birth defects.<br/><br/>The NSF-Simons Center for Multiscale Cell Fate Research will establish new understanding of mechanisms and principles of cell fate control through investigation of emerging behavior of cells across scales. The study aims for transformative insight into cell fate, with a focus on three biological themes: cellular complexity and plasticity in skin, stochastic dynamics and migration of neural crest cells, and epigenetic control of stem cell specification. While each theme addresses different gaps in understanding of cell fate, they all emphasize emergent complexity arising from multiscale interactions, and they share several mathematical aspects. The Center aims to develop new mathematical methods driven by these specific cell-fate questions as well as broader biological applications. Data-driven and principle-based multiscale models of cell fate will guide experiments, with subsequent feedback to the modeling efforts. Three concerted efforts will be made to enhance overall capacity of research and training at the interface between mathematics and biology: 1) expanding mathematical sciences proximal to the biology interface, 2) connecting mathematical scientists across the spectrum, and 3) fostering mathematical scientists' ability to connect directly to experiments. A wide range of new and closely interconnected community-building and outreach programs, including community-initiated Interdisciplinary Opportunity Awards, a Convergence Accelerator Team program with national reach, a BioBridge Clinic on experimental techniques, and a Mathematical Experience through Learning Research program for high school students, will be developed and implemented to achieve the Center's ambitious goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experiments detect fast molecular changes on timescales down to hundreds of attoseconds (1 attosecond is one billionth of a billionth of a second).  Such measurements have only become possible in the last 15 years due to new methods for producing attosecond light pulses with lasers.  Because electrons move so rapidly, their motion (electron dynamics) becomes central to the molecular processes under investigation.  This research measures fast electron motion, such as when charges redistribute or periodically change in molecules, or electrons hop as the structure of the molecule transforms.  To accomplish this, Professor Leone produces two laser pulses, one to excite the molecules and one delayed in time to measure the molecular response, analogous to a starting pistol and a stopwatch in a race. These experiments use numerous optical technologies to obtain the required short pulses and accurate time delays. The benefits to society are anticipated from the development of measurement capabilities that push the boundaries of time using tools that require precision stability.  These techniques are important as the dimensions of devices decrease and performance speeds of storage media and computational tools increase. The students engaged in this project are learning an array of techniques and principles relevant for high technology professions, including laser technology, electronics, and computing.<br/><br/>Attosecond time-resolved measurements represent a new way to probe chemical dynamics on timescales short enough to separate electron dynamics from nuclear motion. Electron dynamics such as electron correlation and electronic superposition states play a central role in chemical processes on these short timescales, as does the breakdown of the separability of timescales between electrons and nuclei (Born Oppenheimer). To study these phenomena, an experimental laboratory based on the production of isolated attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range is employed. The chemical systems involve measurements of few-femtosecond and subfemtosecond (attosecond) time dynamics of electronic superpositions, dissociation processes, and passage through curve crossings or conical intersections of electronically excited molecules.  The students involved in this attosecond measurement-based project are gaining experience in a variety of areas that are emerging in high tech industry. These include, for example, carrier-envelope-phase stabilized lasers, interferometric control of light, core level spectroscopy principles, x-ray optical programming, electron spectrometers, and rate equation approaches to predict ionization, orbital occupancy, and alignment."

Nature uses membranes to encapsulate biological cells. Understanding the process in nature and then building vesicles that mimic cell membranes is useful. The vesicles can, for example, be used as microscale chemical reactors or as vehicles for encapsulating and controllably releasing therapeutic drugs. The principal investigator (PI) and his students will investigate the effects of physical parameters such as the temperature, the ionic strength of the solution, and the charge density of the phospholipids on vesicle formation. The research team will study the encapsulation of ionic cargo into the vesicles under differing physical conditions. Experimental data that is gathered will be used to build and test analytical and numerical models to better understand the process of formation of vesicles and the process of encapsulating cargo.  The award will also support the PI's efforts to enhance the undergraduate and graduate Bioengineering curricula by designing new hands-on laboratory courses. The PI will create a customizable experimental toolkit, the ""SynCell Toolkit"", that will be implemented in K-12 classrooms to increase interest in biomaterials research. The award will provide opportunities for research experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in a diverse multidisciplinary environment in the relatively under-served region of Central California.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>Giant vesicles are in vitro constructs that mimic the minimal configuration of biological cells. There is still a lack of a general understanding of the process of vesiculation that leads to giant vesicle formation from surface-supported smectic phospholipid films.  This CAREER award will support an integrated research, education, and outreach plan to obtain new knowledge and fundamental insights into the basic process of giant vesicle formation and the encapsulation of solutes in vesicles. A key distinguishing approach of this proposal is the PI's use of a continuum approximation to analyze the evolution of a population of vesicles rather than focusing on analyzing the growth of isolated vesicles. This approach is enabled by two key discoveries in the PI's lab: (1) The discovery of a cellulose-based method for forming giant vesicles, (2) A stopped-growth method for large-scale analysis of images that can characterize the entire population of vesicles from a sample.  The PI will achieve his integrated research and educational goals by using a combination of experiments, and analytical and numerical modeling. Research aims include: (1) Understanding the dynamics of vesiculation by studying whole populations of giant vesicles produced on cellulose paper. (2) Deciphering the intermolecular and/or intersurface forces that govern vesiculation by controlled perturbation of double-layer electrostatic forces and membrane undulation forces. (3) Understanding the process of encapsulation of ionic solutes during vesiculation by temporally decoupling the process of growth from the process of loading cargo. The educational and outreach components include: (1) Incorporating laboratory components and new courses designed to foster a mode of inquiry-based learning to the Bioengineering curricula. (2) Developing a customizable ""SynCell Toolkit"", that will be implemented in K-12 classrooms to encourage K-12 students to pursue careers in STEM. (3) Provide opportunities for research experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates the chemistry behind gas-phase Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which can assist in purification of air directly in factory emission points or in building air-conditioning systems. The promise of AOP is that the technology can limit the high energy consumption associated with traditional filter-based air-cleaning systems. However, the FUV photolysis and processes utilized in AOPs may result in compounds more toxic than the parent pollutant. An accurate understanding of the fundamental kinetics and chemical reaction pathways associated with FUV degradation of the organic pollutants is crucial to determining the nature of the resulting compounds and their environmental fate and impact.

To access this sensitivity, charged atoms (ions) are individually isolated in vacuum chambers, cooled to nearly absolute zero by lasers, and levitated in electromagnetic fields known as ion traps.  Ytterbium ions, arguably the most popular for this type of science, can store energy for years in a unique (and poorly understood) ""metastable"" excited state.  Rare atomic effects have been predicted to exist in this metastable state that should make it particularly good for building atomic clocks and seeing the shape of the atom's tiny nucleus.  This program is experimentally studying these effects for the first time to gain insight into the high precision measurement capabilities offered by this unusual state.<br/><br/>This program seeks to observe and study two unusual features that have been predicted to exist in the low-lying 2F7/2 state of the relatively unexplored (I=5/2) ytterbium-173 isotope.  First, hyperfine-induced state mixing 173Yb+ has been theoretically predicted to reduce the lifetime of four of the six hyperfine levels of the 2F7/2 state by approximately two orders of magnitude  (as compared to 171Yb+) to the experimentally-desirable level of a few days.  The group is measuring this effect for each affected hyperfine state to determine how large the corresponding reduction in ac Stark shift systematic error will be when this system is used in place of the current 171 isotope as a clock.  Second, the group is demonstrating a scheme to measure the (currently unknown) hyperfine structure in the 2F7/2 state of 173Yb+. The large spin of both the electronic state and the nucleus allows the possibility that this ""electron microscope for the nucleus"" will show signatures of its electromagnetic multipole moments, including the nuclear magnetic octupole, electric hexadecapole, and possibly even the magnetic 32-pole moment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continuous flow chemistry is a process in which reactants are mixed together into tubes allowing a chemical reaction to occur under precisely controlled conditions where numerous reaction conditions can be adjusted. This method is of increasing importance in the chemical industry where it is used in multi-step processes leading to the efficient production of pharmaceuticals and other value-added chemicals. With the careful experimental control offered by this technology, the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and reaction time result in new relationships between chemical structure and reactivity that are not observable in traditional ""one-pot"" chemistry synthesis. Students involved in this research are investigating complex chemical reactions providing them the opportunity to express their own creative design of making natural products. The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a major tool for predicting chemical reactivity gives further insight into the nature of chemical bonds and their inherent reactivity. This research provides a fertile learning platform for both doctoral and masters graduate students to launch scientific careers that benefit society through gainful employment in academic, entrepreneurial, and industrial settings in advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research focuses on transferring successful batch chemistries to continuous flow reactions to increase selectivity, chemical diversity, and productivity with improved safety metrics. Importantly, microscale segmented flow techniques provide rapid assessment of product formation and enable continuous flow optimization as a basis for future automation. The ability to differentiate between seemingly equivalent hydroxyl groups in order to achieve specific functionalization is a major challenge for chemical synthesis development. Typically, several protection and deprotection steps are required, which increases production time and decreases step economy. In addition, many of the procedures require synthetic expertise, which limits accessibility to scientists outside the chemical synthesis arena. Automated synthesis platforms including peptide and nucleic acid synthesizers have been widely adopted by non-experts and have transformed chemical biology research. Increasing access of natural product analogs to biomedical researchers was proclaimed a top priority in a recent National Academy of Sciences publication on the future of glycosciences.

There is an outstanding opportunity to reduce this cost by replacing current incandescent and fluorescent lighting with white light emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the color quality and efficiency must be improved further. These LED-based light bulbs produce white light by using a luminescent powder called a phosphor, coating on top of a near-ultraviolet (UV) or blue-emitting LED chip. The phosphor is a key component in these devices because it is critical for the overall efficiency and color of these bulbs; unfortunately, there are only a few viable phosphors available for this application today. Therefore, it is prudent to discover new phosphor systems to fully realize the conversion to new efficient lighting. The researchers are addressing this challenge by developing computational and data-driven methods to predict the properties of phosphors. This approach allows the directed discovery of new phosphors with enhanced optical response. This grant also supports extensive scientific education including sponsoring numerous research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students. These students, mostly from underrepresented groups, are learning how to synthesize and characterize phosphors as well as the importance of this energy-efficient technology. The graduate students supported by this work are trained to pursue opportunities in the optoelectronics industry and also across the technology sector where materials science play a crucial role. Finally, the computational products of this research are disseminated through open-source platforms, so all researchers benefit from the scientific developments.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Replacing a traditional light bulb with an energy-efficient, phosphor converted-light emitting diode is one of the easiest ways to decrease electricity consumption. This goal requires the discovery of new phosphor systems, which convert the nearly monochromatic LED light into a broad spectrum white light, to fully make use of this technology. The phosphors investigated in this project are based on wide band gap materials (hosts) that contain a small amount of activator (rare-earth element). Depending on the host:activator combination, colors across the visible spectrum are obtained. The central hypothesis driving this research is that the quantum efficiency and thermal quenching resistance of a phosphor are related to the local coordination environment of the activator ion. This research employs advanced first-principles calculations, local structure analysis using X-ray and neutron scattering, and data science to establish a quantitative understanding of this relationship. Modeling these properties using computational tools and confirming the predictions through materials synthesis and characterization produces a feedback loop where our research results are improved with each discovery. The outcome is a series of design rules that will lead to the discovery of new phosphors with superior optical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus of the research is on a property of electrons called spin, which is analogous to the spinning rotation of a planet around its axis.

While each elementary process of the reaction is intrinsically a nanoscale phenomenon dictated by local material properties and geometry, the electrochemical properties have been mostly analyzed through bulk (volume-averaged) measurements. To obtain a breakthrough in electrode design, a more thorough understanding of the process at the nanoscale is needed. This project aims for new insights about the electrochemical reactions through in situ nanoscale observations, which is enabled by a novel scanning probe microscopy type instrument. This project is training undergraduate and graduate researchers (including underrepresented minority students) for their future employment in the energy technology sector. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The performance of solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers are largely affected by the kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER).

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award is to support the NSF-funded DarkSide (DS) groups for the construction of DarkSide-20k (DS-20k), a direct WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 tons (20 tons).<br/><br/>DarkSide collaborators have proposed a technology for separation of He-3 at large He-4 production plants that could alleviate future shortages of the rare helium isotope. The Urania project will establish a long-term facility that will be able to produce hundreds of tons of low-radioactivity underground argon (UAr), and will supply UAr for several programs beyond DarkSide-20k, such as for radiometry, Ar-39 age dating of ground water, and National Security treaty verification. The DarkSide program will advance technologies for detection of Ar-37, used for nuclear test ban verification, and Ar-39, used for radiometric dating. The Aria project will further reduce the Ar-39 in UAr by isotope separation, yielding as by-product the ability to separate important stable isotopes such as O-18, N-15, and C-13. These are used to produce radionuclides for medical positron emission tomography (PET). Technologies for advanced gas purification, precision cleaning, production of ultra-pure titanium, and reduction of radioactivity in silicon chips will also be developed.<br/><br/>The significant improvement in sensitivity is made possible by technology developed within several world-wide programs toward WIMP recoil detection with liquid argon as the target, and in particular within the DarkSide-10 and DarkSide-50 programs, including operation of the DarkSide-50 LAr TPC with both atmospheric argon (AAr) and underground argon (UAr) fills. Liquid argon is an excellent medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile ('pulse shape') depends on the nature of the ionizing particle, providing powerful particle discrimination to suppress background from natural radioactivity. Using AAr in DarkSide-50, it was demonstrated that pulse shape analysis suppresses beta/gamma backgrounds by a factor in excess of 1.5 x 10^7, one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The heavy-tailed character of the distribution of empirical data has been repeatedly observed in many fields of research, including microarray studies in genomics, neuroimaging in medicine, and portfolio optimization and risk management in finance. In functional MRI studies, the parametric statistical methods often fail to produce valid cluster-wise inference, where the principal cause is that the spatial autocorrelation functions do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape; in finance, the power-law nature of the distribution of returns has been validated as a stylized fact over the years. The least squares method, albeit being most commonly used in practice due to its simplicity as a once-for-all solution, is sensitive to the tails of sample distributions and is proven to be suboptimal for heavy-tailed data from a non-asymptotic viewpoint. In this project, the PI will develop robust statistical procedures for various problems, ranging from mean estimation, linear regression, high-dimensional sparse regression to large covariance matrix estimation. The main goals of this research are to understand the finite-sample properties of robust learning, and to develop computationally efficient procedures that advance the practical use of robust methods.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will study robust alternatives to the method of least squares for two fundamental problems: linear regression and covariance estimation. To achieve robustness against asymmetric and heavy-tailed data, the main idea is to use the adaptive Huber loss and its extension on the matrix space. From a non-asymptotic viewpoint, the accompanying scale parameter should adapt to the sample size, dimension and noise level for optimal tradeoff between the gain in stability and cost in bias. The work on the project aims to (i) develop new methods for robust estimation and inference under linear models, and investigate their mathematical underpinnings using techniques from concentration inequality in probability, finite-sample theory for M-estimation in statistics and convex analysis in optimization, and (ii) construct both general and structured large covariance matrix estimators under minimal assumptions on the data. The originality of the project resides in providing new perspectives on robustness, which not only represent useful complements to classical robust statistics but also make important contributions to modern statistical analysis, including high dimensional estimation and large-scale inference. The philosophy of the project echos John Tukey's principles for statistical practice by highlighting the importance of having methods of statistical analysis that are robust to violations of the assumptions underlying their use and allowing the possibility of data's influencing the choice of method by which they are analyzed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yarmoff of the University of California - Riverside is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the charge distribution within supported metal nanoclusters.  Professor Yarmoff and his students use specialized characterization methods to investigate how the properties of metal nanoparticles are affected by the nature of the support material on which they reside and how defects in the support alter their properties. In particular, they measure the charge on individual atoms within the clusters and observe how the cluster size and number of support defects affect what molecules will or will not stick to the supports.  Nanoparticles are a distinctive class of materials because they have sizes intermediate between molecules (few atoms) and solids (trillions of atoms).  Nanoscale materials exhibit unique chemical and electronic properties that depend on their size, leading to many potential applications that include advanced electronics, battery technologies, solar power generation, environmental remediation, and chemical catalysis.  Understanding, and then learning how to control the properties of nanoscale materials broadly, impacts knowledge in basic science and practical applications.  A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California-Riverside, an Hispanic serving institution, are gaining valuable experience by conducting laboratory experiments in a field at the forefront of modern science.

Supported metal nanoclusters are directly deposited, or produced by buffer layer assisted growth (BLAG), onto oxide, sulfide, fluoride and frozen noble gas substrates. A novel form of low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is used to investigate the charge distribution within metal nanoclusters by measuring the neutralization of scattered low energy alkali ions. This method previously showed that the charge within a gold nanocluster is inhomogeneous, with the edge atoms being positively charged while the center atoms are essentially neutral. This project builds on this knowledge by exploring how the charge distribution depends on the cluster and substrate materials, the number of defects at the cluster/support interface, the subsequent adsorption of electronegative and electropositive adatoms and small molecules, and how defects in the substrate modify adsorption. The research results wicontribute to a fundamental understanding of metal nanoclusters, thereby enabling the tailoring of their properties to improve functionality and practical utility. The research may have a significant and broad impact on the field by providing an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials while developing methods to control them, which will facilitate their use in numerous advanced manufacturing applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In his earlier research, the principal investigator (PI) created new tools for optimal transport theory, a theory which  has experienced a mathematical renaissance over the last twenty-five years by weaving together threads from analysis, geometry, partial differential equations (PDEs) and dynamical systems. Motivated by his work on systems with large numbers of particles, the PI, with collaborators,  has discovered some connections between optimal transportation, games with a large number of players, and Mean Field Games. These unexpected connections open doors to several new  avenues of research, some of which being  described in this proposal.  The goal of this project is to advance knowledge in various other related topics. This includes the geometry of the space of closed differential forms with  the  non--linear factorization of  differential forms.  This proposal involves  training students, mentoring postdocs and organizing  learning seminars for graduate students. The PI will remain involved in national as well as international activities. These, constitute the broader impacts of the proposed activities. <br/><br/>The PI studies the mathematical aspects of Density Functional Theory (DFT), as well as  certain  geometric clustering problems originating in combinatorial optimization. What many of these problems have in common, and what is sometimes novel in the approach for studying them, is their formulation on infinite dimensional ``manifolds''  equipped with metric, differential, and symplectic pseudo-structures.  This infinite dimensional setting often lead to a new outlook and --at least on the formal level-- to novel and simpler approaches to otherwise complex problems. A typical example is how Otto's calculus turns many nonlinear PDEs into gradient flows of geodesically convex functionals. In a similar fashion, our searching for geodesic of minimal lengths on the set of  differential forms, leads to a new concept of ``quasiconvexity,"" that looks like an extension of the concept originally  introduced by C. Morrey and used extensively in non--linear elasticity theory. Part of the challenge, however, includes turning formal arguments into rigorous ones to yield new results.  The intellectual merit of the research is that the problems to be studied have the potential of revealing principles which can be extended to a more general context."

To realize this potential, scientists and engineers must find the right physical system in which to implement quantum bits, called qubits, with sufficiently low error rates. Small superconducting devices are one of the most promising candidates for building physical devices that function as qubits. This research seeks to address fundamental questions about the nature of small superconducting devices. The researchers make sensitive magnetic measurements to detect the current flowing through a superconducting device to determine whether it has a conventional superconducting state or an unconventional, ""topological"" superconducting state. Topological superconducting state are states that host special modes at their boundaries, called Majoranas modes. Qubits based on these Majorana modes could greatly reduce errors compared to other types of qubits. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The proposed operation of topological qubits is based on a special zero-energy modes known as Majorana modes. The objective of this research is to experimentally demonstrate the existence of Majorana modes using a new generation of fast, highly sensitive Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors. The two most important properties are the current-phase relation, a fundamental relation that will have conclusive signatures of Majoranas if they are present and stable, and the parity lifetime, which determines how long the Majorana states are stable. The experiments address longstanding questions in conventional (non-topological) mesoscopic superconductivity, such as the behavior of tunable few-mode junctions with perfect transmission. They also address newer, more urgent questions in topological devices, such as in which systems Majorana fermions exist and for how long their properties are stable. The realization and control of Majoranas would have great foundational significance as an experimental instance of engineered particles with non-Abelian statistics and could also enable certain quantum information technologies. The activities additionally foster the development of fast, ultrasensitive magnetic measurement techniques that are relatively noninvasive. The researchers engage actively in community and outreach activities designed to provide role models and experiential learning to science students at all levels. Student and postdoctoral researchers involved in the research are well-trained in nanotechnology, cryogenics, quantum science, and precision measurements, and are prepared for a lifetime of contributions both as educators and as scientists."

Being able to control this patterning in next-generation polymers is important for applications such as nanolithography, flexible electronics, and biomedicine. These polymers have much more complicated chemical structures and molecular-scale shapes than typical polymer molecules. This project is targeted at understanding how complexity in the molecule's chemical structure and shape affects its ability to form patterns involving the mutual packing of many molecules.  To do this, molecules will be designed and studied that are inspired by biological polymers (proteins) but allow for tuning of their shape, stiffness, and chemical structure.   Undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be trained at national research user-facilities, participate in local and national scientific meetings, and interact closely with research collaborators. Combining both research and learning to interact in the broader scientific community comprises an integral part of the educational experience for graduate students bound for either industrial careers or the academic world. Furthermore, the PI will partner with the UCSB Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships to incorporate a diverse cadre of incoming community-college transfer students into the research group to both ease transfer shock and provide research experience.

The ability to synthesize sequence-specific polypeptoids at gram scale presents a unique opportunity to directly test predictions of copolymer self-assembly that suggest both 'blockiness' and gradient strength in a copolymer sequence impacts the chain's ability to minimize free energy by sorting monomers to the preferred side of the interface.   Furthermore, the chain persistence length is tunable on a single chemical platform by controlling the sequence, side chain chirality, and bulkiness.  This platform provides the conformational (persistence length) control necessary to explore the continuum of semiflexible chain shapes between the rod and coil limits. In addition, the fundamental role of asymmetry in contributing long-range entropic effects to the free energy of mixing will be explored.  The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of how sequence and chain shape impact the free energy contributions to block copolymer self-assembly. It is expected that this fundamental understanding will guide the design of semiflexible and sequence-defined block copolymers and ultimately impact fields as diverse as organic optoelectronics and biomaterials."

This study of curvature is important in all domains of science and engineering. For example, the theory of general relativity posits that gravity curves space and time in a mathematically precise manner, while in materials science, the meeting points between crystal structures are modeled by (a rather different notion of) curvature. This project is concerned with the study of a particular measure of bending called scalar curvature. Scalar curvature is one of the simplest measures of bending, but due to this simplicity scalar curvature can contain only a limited amount of information. Hence, we must study scalar curvature through highly indirect means. One way to explore scalar curvature is in relation to the isoperimetric problem: in a given space, how can we enclose the largest amount of volume with the smallest perimeter? This is one of the oldest mathematical questions, but its link to scalar curvature is only recently beginning to be understood. The PI's project will continue the study of scalar curvature as it affects the large-scale behavior of area and volume, with particular emphasis on the relationship between such topics and problems related to general relativity. In addition to this research, this project will also support the PI's continued efforts to promote student learning and training through seminar organization, conferences, and summer schools, as well as expository articles and notes.  <br/><br/>A major component of the research plan is the continued study of the link between large-scale variational problems and scalar curvature, motivated by geometric and physical considerations such as the Penrose inequality and static uniqueness questions from general relativity. To this end, the PI plans to continue his investigation of global uniqueness questions related to scalar curvature and the isoperimetric problem. Recently, several such problems have been understood in three dimensions, using a combination of powerful tools from geometric analysis (many of which are limited to three dimensions). One portion of the research will consist of investigating higher dimensional analogues of these results, which will necessitate the development of a wide array of new techniques. The ideas developed in these aforementioned global uniqueness works have also led to other (a priori unrelated) topics that the PI will investigate. For example, determining the validity of the Minkowski inequality for non-convex surfaces (possibly with an additional bending term) is related to the uniqueness question for large stable constant mean curvature surfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds. Similarly, an invariant related to the least area in the homology class of a torus for certain Riemannian three-manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature is related to the rigidity of area-minimizing cylinders in three-manifolds of non-negative scalar curvature. In a different (but related) direction, this project will also include investigation of the relationship between the geometry and topology of minimal surfaces, including the study of surfaces with simple topology or small index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These polymers contain a small amount of 1, 4, 7, 10 tetra-phenylamide substituted s-dibenzocyclooctadiene (DBCOD), a flexible cyclooctane group fused to one rigid phenyl ring at each end. The research group hypothesizes that this thermal contraction stems from DBCOD's conformational up-conversion from the global minimum to a local minimum.  The relative energies of these two conformers and the energy barriers of this conformational transition can be adjusted by the local environment (e.g., substitution type and pattern). To acquire a fundamental understanding of substituent effects on the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the DBCOD conformational change, they conduct a multidisciplinary investigation that involves computation-guided model system synthesis and atomic and molecular scale characterizations.  The goal of this project is to establish substitution design rules that correlate specific substituents to their effects on conformation properties.   To connect atomic-scale changes to macroscopic behavior and validate the design guideline, they use the DBCOD derivative that favors the twist-boat conformation at lower temperature and the chair conformation at higher temperature to make a linear polymer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project studies the discrete structure of algebraic and geometric objects, and the algebraic and geometric structure of matroids and polytopes. This interdisciplinary perspective offers unexpected and effective approaches to long-standing problems. This research program constitutes the academic backbone of a vibrant research and training collaboration among primarily undergraduate institutions in the U.S. and Colombia. Through research-based courses, vertically and geographically integrated research projects, and the biannual Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria, students participate in a truly international cooperation while making substantial scientific contributions to combinatorics. Since 2007 this initiative has trained more than 150 pre-Ph.D. U.S. students, more than half of whom are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and more than 50 of whom have gone onto Ph.D. programs. The initiative also serves mathematicians worldwide through the distribution of course videos, lecture notes, and research projects.<br/><br/>This project studies three interdisciplinary and interrelated research directions: 1. By studying the geometric structure of matroids, we obtain purely combinatorial results that seem intractable without the geometric perspective, and we establish foundational results in tropical geometry and combinatorial Hodge theory. 2. We measure polytopes of interest by recognizing that they are part of ?the right? family of polytopes, and finding a formula for the measure of all the polytopes in that family. The results have consequences in toric geometry and representation theory. 3. We explore the Hopf-algebraic structure of various families of polytopes. The resulting objects are useful in numerous combinatorial and algebraic applications, and they raise geometric questions of independent interest. At the heart of each of these three projects lies a configuration of vectors - usually a root system - that plays an essential role. The combinatorial theories of polytopes and (Coxeter) matroids are designed to study such configurations, and the powerful toolkit that they offer is the unifying thread of this project. Solutions to the proposed problems will have a strong impact in combinatorics and discrete geometry, and will further our understanding of central questions in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past decade, while GWAS have been very successful in detecting genetic variants that affect complex human traits/diseases, these discoveries have only accounted for a small portion of the genetic factors.  Recently, significant progress has been made using statistical analysis based on a class of statistical models called mixed effects models.  However, there is a gap in understanding why the method works, because, in a way, the statistical model used in the analysis is misspecified.  This project aims to fill the gap by developing new theory and methods, and evaluating the methods through applications to real data.  The project will promote teaching, training and learning, broaden the participation of students from under-represented groups, and build research networks between institutions.  The research will be of great interest to many other areas of science, and the results will be widely disseminated in subject matter domain journals. <br/><br/>In the past decade, more than 24,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be associated with at least one trait/disease at the genome-wide significance level.  However, these significantly associated SNPs only account for a small portion of the genetic factors underlying complex human traits/diseases, referred to as ""missing heritability"" in the genetics community.  Recently, significant progress has been made in using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach based on linear mixed models (LMM).  While the REML approach appears to provide the right answer to many problems of practical interest, researchers have been puzzled by the fact that the LMM, under which the REML estimators are derived, is misspecified.  In a recently published article, the investigators proved that the REML estimators of some important genetic quantities, such as heritability and the variance of the environmental error, are consistent despite the model misspecification.  While this pioneering work led to a new field called misspecified mixed model analysis (MMMA), many theoretical and practical challenges remain unsolved.  This project seeks to address the following problems: (1) extension of MMMA to correlated SNPs, (2) development of the asymptotic distribution of the REML estimator under misspecified LMM, (3) resampling methods for MMMA, (4) estimation of the number of nonzero random effects, and (5) extensions to multiple random effect factors and discrete traits.

This technique provide the unique fingerprint for chemical identification. As such, Raman spectroscopy is extremely useful for a number of applications in chemical, environmental and threat detection monitoring.  While a highly useful technique, the Raman scattering cross-section of most molecules is extremely small, and this generally limits its potential uses. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Graphene Enhanced Raman Scattering (GERS), the techniques investigated in this research project, can be used to improve the small signal intensities, thus making Raman spectroscopy-related applications more practical. In terms of broader impacts Dr. Cronin creates workshops for Los Angeles high school chemistry teachers. He leverages existing relationships between USC and its neighboring high schools (e.g., USC's Good Neighbors Campaign, Joint Education Project, and the Service Learning Program) to increase the attendance from disadvantaged schools (i.e., central Los Angeles inner city schools) serving underrepresented minority groups. The content of the workshop is reformulated to expose underrepresented students to the results and, more importantly, the excitement of research. Research projects for undergraduate students introduce them to fundamental scientific research and give them confidence to pursue careers in science and engineering. A new module devoted to SERS is developed for a new course at USC on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and their research accomplishments are discussed in class and integrated into the curriculum.  Professor Jansen uses a website, nanoHub.org, to share their computational tools with scientists outside of his labs.  <br/><br/>In this collaboration, Professors Cronin and Jensen investigate the mechanism behind the strong spectroscopic responses observed in two surface-based spectroscopic techniques: Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Graphene Enhanced Raman Scattering (GERS).  They use both experimental and computational tools to carefully isolate the enhanced Raman signals caused by Chemical Enhancement (CE) from those signals caused by ElectroMagnetic Enhancement (EM) in order to understand the CE mechanism.  Specifically, Professor Cronin's group at USC performs Raman spectroscopy of single molecules on various SERS substrates, which enables a direct comparison with the theoretical calculations preformed at the Jensen's group at PSU.  The Raman spectra are collected under various electrochemical conditions in order to explore the role of the molecule-metal energy level alignment and decouple the vibrational-mode-specific chemical enhancement from the uniform chemical enhancement.  Professor Jensen's first principles calculations provide a detailed theoretical framework for interpreting chemical enhancement in SERS and GERS spectra to facilitate a better understanding of the chemical enhancement mechanism. Students in both groups experience the interdisciplinary training opportunities.  Both groups' are actively engaged in outreach activities to local high school teachers and general public."

Such devices currently are based on semiconductor technology, which involves making electrical contacts between metals and semiconductors. By studying and understanding the details of how metals can be deposited onto semiconductor materials, this project will allow the development of novel methods to grow low dimensional nanostructures, such as extremely thin wires and very thin films. The project connects state-of-the-art experiments to observe the growth properties of the materials with sophisticated theoretical techniques using models consisting of tens to millions of atoms to explore the physics governing the predicted properties of the fabricated nanostructures. Working in conjunction, these methods will facilitate the optimal design and creation of these low dimensional nanostructures. Such structures could be very useful in making future electronic devices, thus maintaining the technological leadership of the U.S. in nanotechnology. Students working on the project will not only gain in-depth physical understanding in the exciting research areas involving metal-semiconductor interfaces but also will engage in outreach activities with local K-12 students and teachers with whom the PIs have on-going interactions, especially through the American Physical Society Physics Teacher Education Coalition (APS PhysTEC). All PIs regularly mentor undergraduate researchers and are actively engaged in recruiting women and underrepresented minority students, particularly through the APS Bridge Program.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project will study the growth mechanisms of several metal on semiconductor systems. The objectives of this project are controlling the growth of low-dimensional (1D and 2D) nanostructures, elucidating the novel and complex collective diffusion behavior which has been observed for these systems, and understanding how quantum behavior can influence epitaxial growth in order to facilitate the optimal design and fabrication of novel materials. A complementary set of experimental and theoretical techniques will be applied to examine systematically the initial growth stages and structural evolution of Ag, Au, and Pb nanostructures on single crystal surfaces of Ge and Si. The atomic ordering and adatom binding sites, as well as sizes and shapes of formed islands, will be determined by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low energy electron microscopy/diffraction (LEEM/LEED) and compared with predictions from density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations. Unusual collective behavior of millions of atoms and quantum size effects (QSE) will be investigated to elucidate details of the mechanisms. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to measure local density of states, k-resolved band structure, and quantum well states; these results will be compared with DFT calculations to understand the factors controlling the nanostructure characteristics and to formulate the physical picture about the basic mechanisms and processes for future growths. Bond order potentials (BOP) will be determined for metals bound to semiconductor surfaces and used for self-learning kinetic Monte Carlo (SLKMC) simulations of the growth and movement of islands. These large-scale simulations will improve understanding of the physical origin of the collective motions and suggest additional experimental systems that may display unusual physical phenomena. The use of Si and Ge-based materials would enable rapid development of technological applications for electronic devices."

While this question has been explored in well-mixed populations with great effort and quantitative success, there is a large gap between theory and experiments for natural populations exhibiting spatial structure. This leaves us at a serious loss in understanding the evolutionary response of, e.g., microbial colonies or biofilms, and makes it impossible to predict the pace of drug-resistance evolution. The P.I. has demonstrated in his past research that theory and experiments can be joined effectively to dissect the evolutionary processes induced by spatial structure. This effprt puts this work onto a new level by the use of innovative experimental designs such as engineered microbial systems to track the spontaneous emergence of selectable mutant clones, and theoretical concepts that allow dealing with fluctuations and eco-evolutionary feedbacks exactly. The results of this project will advance our understanding of spatio-temporal aspects of adaptation, and elucidate specifically how populations respond to environmental deterioration, which is key to efforts ranging from the rational design of strategies to conserve species in the face of environmental change to mitigating drug resistance evolution. The data set generated by this experimental research, combined with novel theory and simulations, will allow the community to reassess established paradigms about adaptation of microbial populations. The research will invite novel interdisciplinary activities in the quest to understand, predict and control adaptation of spatially-structured microbial populations. The interdisciplinary research is closely orchestrated with broad educational efforts designed to promote crossing of traditional disciplinary boundaries to achieve new ways of thinking about evolutionary processes, such as drug resistance evolution, that transcend the limitations of the standard mean-field theories of evolution. At the graduate and undergraduate level, the research will be accompanied by a new interdisciplinary course, Statistical Biophysics of Cells and Populations, that the PI offers to students of physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. In addition, the PI has established a firm collaboration with the Lawrence Hall of Science at Berkeley to prepare novel educational resources for high-school students and undergraduates to explore the ubiquity and evolutionary potential of microbial populations and to establish the crucial link between ecology and evolution. These resources, which include a learning module and hands-on activities, will be documented in write-ups and made freely available online through existing NSF-funded cyber-infrastructure platforms.<br/><br/>Demography and evolution are tightly intertwined. The distribution of individuals in space determines the influx of new mutations, the strength of genetic drift and the competition between genotypes. Evolution on the other hand, influences the sizes and densities populations can attain, how individuals migrate and interact with each other and the environment and how they reproduce and die. The feedback between population dynamics and evolution is absent in standard models of evolving well-mixed populations. Yet, it constrains the pace of adaptation, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes and the evolutionary response of spatially-structured populations. The objective of this project is to fill this gap by quantifying the associated eco-evolutionary feedback in microbial populations and its consequences for adaptation. To this end, the P.I. proposes tightly-controlled microbial evolution experiments to quantify how population dynamics alters patterns of molecular evolution, and new population genetics theory that bridges the gap in spatio-temporal scales between laboratory experiments and natural populations. The specific aims are: 1. Determine how the stochastic dynamics of how cells generate population-level patterns of genetic drift and selection and how these patterns control the fate of beneficial mutations. Generalize well-established theories of evolution in well-mixed populations to capture the eco-evolutionary feedback dynamics of the experiments. 2. Determine how spatially-structured populations adapt to environmental challenges (i) via pre-existing mutations and (ii) via the accumulation of new mutations. 3. Establish a new course, a workshop on unintentional biases and undergraduate mentoring to increase diversity in the STEM fields at UC Berkeley.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster and the Systems and Synthetic Biology clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Such nonequilibrium conditions occur throughout the natural and synthetic world. Materials are seldom assembled quasi-statically.  Chemical reactions are often initiated with excitation.  Life would cease if not constantly supplied with sources of energy. Despite this ubiquity, there are few numerical tools designed to glean macroscopic consequences from these driven molecular components. Without such tools, progress in chemistry is stifled.  There are few physical principles to act a guide, to bound possibilities, to explain observations and  to predict novel behavior. By using recent developments in an area of mathematics known as large deviation theory, Dr. Limmer and his research group develop methods to fill this void.  This allows them to address contemporary questions in active, driven, fluctuating, and flowing systems. These developments are done in conjunction with an effort to enhance scientific literacy through youth based scientific computing initiatives including  games-based learning programs designed to convey basic nonequilibrium concepts. <br/><br/>  <br/>In order to develop novel numerical tools for studying driven molecular systems, Prof. Limmer and his research group use results from large deviation theory. Large deviation theory clarifies an isomorphism between algorithms to study nonequilibrium systems and those employed in traditional quantum chemistry, by defining an eigenvalue equation whose solution codifies the stability and response properties of general nonequilibrium steady states. While solving this equation exactly for interacting systems is exponentially hard, Dr. Limmer develops techniques for approximating it formally and estimating it stochastically. These techniques take inspiration from methods developed for solving the Schrdinger equation, including using diffusion and variation Monte Carlo, tensor products and many body theories. The class of algorithms Dr. Limmer develops represents a fundamentally different way to approach the simulation of driven molecular systems on a computer, which are predominately simulated by direct integration of an evolution equation. These techniques allow Dr. Limmer and his group to bridge the timescales available to simulation of nonequilibrium systems to those relevant to experiment, by targeting rare fluctuations. These techniques will be used to test the validity of basic constituent relationships of macroscopic transport for describing flows on nanoscales and for determining phase diagrams of active matter where traditional free energy based methods do not apply.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A different strategy for a future generation of electronic devices is based on materials that exist in multiple electronic states. A new generation of electronic materials are required for this purpose, as are the means for switching between multiple electronic states. The fundamental science that is the focus of this project is centered on the sudden change in the electrical properties of certain materials when they are switched through a so-called metal-to-insulator transition by an external trigger. On one side of the transition, the material behaves like copper metal, while on the other side, it behaves like insulating wood. The project goal is to design and discover materials exhibiting such metal-to-insulator transitions that enable room-temperature operation and that display large changes in the key property of interest; the electrical resistivity. The strategy is to control properties by structural design at the atomic scale. The approach employs a tightly integrated combination of experiment, theory, and data-mining of the literature, that would enable new insights to emerge and aid in the design of desirable materials. This project will deliver a research workflow with a suite of tools to enable assessment and experimental validation of new concepts for the discovery of key materials. The project will articulate protocols for selecting high-performing materials, leading to an expanded palette of compounds that could impact future technologies. The teaching and training of students and the discovery capabilities of the project are interwoven, and aimed at broadening participation through the involvement of the investigators and their group members in public outreach events. The development of modules for undergraduate and graduate courses and the involvement of students in interdisciplinary team environments are intrinsic to project plan.

At the present time, the essential data and structure-electronic function relationships to decipher the genetic code (generic descriptors) of metal-to-insulator transitions do not exist in a format which permits predictive synthesis. The project?s significance is that it recasts the problem into one of atomic structure, focusing on the role of different kinds of structural distortions, notably, breathing modes, Jahn-Teller distortions, and Peierls-like instabilities across a broad range of structure types and chemistries. The project will generate and collect a range of data that will permit the mapping of electronic interactions into atomic features, applying informatics-based methods to enable supervised and unsupervised learning. The project will articulate predictive rules and protocols for selecting high-performing materials, leading to an expanded palette of compounds that could impact technologies beyond electronics. The teaching and training of students at multiple levels and the discovery capabilities of the project are interwoven and aimed at broadening participation by through public outreach events, through the development of modules for undergraduate and graduate courses; and finally, by involving students in interdisciplinary team environments. The project will yield a plethora of new data on a range of oxides and new computational materials approaches. These will be aggregated into databases on public web-portals using a new portable file format designed for materials data. New methods of data visualization will allow external users to interact, query, and analyze the data for aims beyond those proposed herein. Data-driven models and informatics workflows for generating quantitative models for metal-to-insulator performance will be hosted with the aforementioned data and visualization tools on the MIST: Metals and Insulators by Structural Tuning platform. The PIs also plan to release MIST as open source and build a user community around the platform by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the MIST codebase. This will allow a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award. Advances in synthesis, theory, and characterization will strengthen the scientific capabilities and workforce by allowing students and academic or industrial researchers to employ the formulated structure-property relationships for educational and research purposes."

The quantum dots are incredibly small, man-made nanocrystals with diameters about 10,000 times narrower than a human hair.  The research seeks to overcome the current limitations on instrumentation and methods at the single nanocrystal level.  This goal is important because the nanocrystals come as an non-uniform mix of particles with different sizes, shapes and structures.  This mixture complicates their study and hinders their use in optoelectronic devices.  The knowledge obtained on single crystals may open the way for the systematic formation of uniform quantum dot materials with decreased toxicity and new functionality in the short-wave infrared -- a spectral region beyond where human eyes can see.  Success in conducting the research may widens the use of quantum dots in biomedical imaging, next-generation optoelectronic devices, optical communications, and solar energy conversion.

Many undergraduates attend institutions that do not afford them the opportunity to participate in research. This project establishes a Research Experience for Undergraduates at Occidental College in Los Angeles. The site will host nine undergraduates each summer, split into teams of three, to work on research problems in data science, game theory, and number theory. An emphasis will be placed on recruiting a diverse group of participants in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic background, as well as type of undergraduate institution being attended. In addition to the research conducted, the mentors will work with the students to improve their public speaking skills and their technical writing skills.  The mentors will conduct panels on ethics, graduate school, and career opportunities in mathematics. <br/><br/>The program offers a blend of computational investigation with theoretical pursuit of open research problems in data science, number theory and positional game theory. The problems to be investigated in this REU fit into the faculty's own research programs and are at the cutting edge of these fields. As such, the results will be of interest to others in the field and often lead to peer reviewed journal publications. The goal of the program is to help students attain a higher level of independence in mathematical research by having them take part in significant and interesting research projects. The participants will learn what it is like to be a professional mathematician. They will be introduced to various tools, techniques and problems from data science, number theory, and game theory and will work on important and often difficult problems that are suitable for undergraduate work. The faculty have a history of interest in working with undergraduates and success in choosing problems at an appropriate level for undergraduate work. The participants will be able to begin investigations almost immediately on computational aspects of the project, giving them an opportunity to spend the entire time at Occidental working on meaningful research. Students will produce reports summarizing their research for the summer; these reports will be posted on an REU website that is to be developed. Upon departing the REU, they will continue to work with their faculty mentors to produce journal publications when appropriate as well as to attend conferences to present their results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Galaxies were just beginning to form from the matter created in the Big Bang, and the intense radiation emitted by these galaxies was burning away the fog of hydrogen gas permeating deep space.  In less than one billion years the fog had cleared, and the young galaxies lived in a Universe where ultraviolet radiation could travel freely through space.  This transformation of the gas in deep space is known as ""cosmic reionization"", and it was a landmark event in the early Universe.  By studying reionization we learn not only about the history of matter in the Universe, but about the formation of the first galaxies.  The goal of this project is to connect the changes we see happening in deep space during reionization to the characteristics of the first galaxies themselves.  How can we combine observations of galaxies and deep space to learn more about this era of cosmic history?  What imprints on the Universe does reionization leave behind?  The PI will use the world's largest telescopes to directly probe both galaxies and intergalactic gas over the same regions early in cosmic history.  The observations will be combined with state-of-the art computer modeling to better understand how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it impacted early galaxies and the matter in deep space.  Building on this research, the PI will integrate his observational expertise into local high-school and undergraduate education.  A key element of this program will be the creation of a campus observatory at UC Riverside.  This will be one of the few such facilities in the country to offer spectroscopy, one of the most broadly used techniques in science and industry, and will be used to promote STEM engagement among underserved groups in Southern California.<br/><br/>Roughly one billion years after the Big Bang the Universe underwent a global transformation.  The first galaxies formed in a Universe filled with dark matter and cold, neutral gas.  As the radiation from these galaxies permeated deep space, however, the gas was ionized and heated, rendering the Universe transparent to ultraviolet photons.  Thirteen billion years later the gas in deep space is still highly ionized.  The early transition from neutral to ionized was therefore the last phase transition of matter in the Universe.  Known as ""reionization"", this transformation was a key event in cosmic history.  <br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to determine when and how reionization occurred by simultaneously studying the gas in deep space and the galaxies embedded within it.  The PI will use the word's largest telescopes to study galaxies (via wide-field imaging) and intergalactic gas (via absorption-line spectroscopy) in the same cosmic volumes during and after reionization.  Spectroscopy will also be used to study the gas in and around galaxies themselves.  These will be the first observations to directly connect the evolving conditions in deep space to the sources driving the evolution.  By further combining data with state-of-the-art modeling, this project will provide a better understanding of how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it shaped early galaxies and intergalactic matter throughout the Universe.

Over the course of the eight-week program, the students will learn to investigate and solve open problems in diverse areas of mathematics, to work in a collaborative environment, to communicate their mathematical results through talks and written reports, and to publish their findings in appropriate journals with the goal of disseminating their research. The program will expose the participants to daily life in graduate school, through interactions with graduate students, graduate advisors, faculty and postdocs in the UCSB math department. In addition, through professional development workshops, the participants will learn about different areas in industry that demand professionals with good research skills. <br/><br/>Historically, the UCSB REU has not focused on a specific area of mathematics. However, the program intends to be accessible to students with a variety of backgrounds in mathematics. Thus, the research projects are likely to be in linear algebra, matrix analysis, numerical linear algebra, combinatorics and graph theory; that is, in areas that do not require extensive mathematical background from students. Examples of topics that have been studied in this program before include 1) primitive circulant matrices; 2) matrix polynomials and linearizations; 3) matrix equations; 4) parking functions; 5) Alexander and Jones polynomials; 6) sequential dynamical systems.  The topics will change every year depending on the active research areas of the mentors involved in the program. The final goal is to expose the students to the techniques and methods used to tackle problems in these areas, to publish papers in refereed professional journals, and to participate and give talks in conferences for undergraduates. The REU concludes with a poster conference in which undergraduates doing summer research in all the UCSB departments present their results and make it accessible to non-experts in the area.

Phase change materials can be switched between multiple atomic configurations that have different properties. This project builds on the recent prediction that some of the newly discovered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit such phase change properties and may provide new opportunities for energy, electronic, information storage, optical, and other important applications with broad societal benefit. The nearly atomically-thin nature of these materials provides fundamentally new physical mechanisms for controlling the transformations that do not exist in known, bulk materials. Furthermore, this project will elucidate the purely scientific theory of 2D structural phase transformations, which is likely to be quite different from conventional theories for bulk materials.<br/><br/>The objectives are to discover how 2D phase change materials can be controlled and reduced to practice in experiments and device applications.  This project seeks to understand the role of substrate interactions, electrostatic gating, temperature, and chemical alloys in the control and stabilization of these phases.  In the process, the research team will tackle some of the most challenging problems in computational materials science by exploring new statistical techniques for systematically improvable analytical interatomic potentials and advancing density functional theory approaches for monolayers on substrates with van der Waals interactions. <br/><br/>To integrate outreach with this research, the PI will host and mentor a group of college-bound, under-represented minority high school students during the summers and involve them in aspects of this project.

This is partially due to their abundant practical applications and their relations to other fields.  For instance, the well-known Four Color Theorem asserts that four colors is always enough to color the regions of a given map such that each region gets one color and two regions sharing some border must receive different colors. This RUI project focuses on intensive research on several graph coloring and choosability problems, which have been frequently used as models for practical applications such as scheduling, traffic control, and the channel assignment problems.  For instance, in scheduling final exam times of all courses at a college, we construct a graph model by representing each course by a vertex, and connecting two vertices (courses) by an edge if a student is taking both courses. The chromatic number of such a graph model provides the minimum number of exam time periods needed in order to schedule all final exams without conflict.  In addition, if some courses set restrictions on certain dates and times, then it becomes a graph choosability problem. Research suitable for undergraduates will be incorporated into Graph Theory and Graduate Seminar courses, providing non-traditional and underrepresented students opportunities to learn cutting edge research methods, and will involve three graduate students yearly to work on research projects.<br/><br/>Graphs provide excellent models for various problems motivated by the channel assignment problem, in which we assign channels to cities or stations such that interference is avoided and the span of channels used is minimized. This RUI project focuses on intensive research on graph coloring and choosability topics with emphasis on utilizing research methodologies and results in number theory, topology, and algebra. The goal is to bring new insight into, and broaden the study of, areas of graph theory that are related to number theory, topology, and algebra, as well as applications to broadcast communication. Specifically, the PI will investigate distance graphs and number theory problems, topological combinatorics, graph choosability, and colorings motivated by the channel assignment problem."

Also, they hold the potential for further innovation, thus it would be extremely useful if one could rationally synthesize new magnetic materials with targeted magnetic properties. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the Principal Investigator's NSF CAREER grant will focus on combining experiment and theory towards designing new transition metal-rich borides with tunable magnetic properties. The combination of experiment and theory in this project enables the prediction of the most exciting magnetic materials before they are subsequently synthesized, thereby accelerating the search for new magnetic materials relevant to energy applications.  The project provides training for both graduate and undergraduate students, who have an excellent opportunity to acquire unique expertise in both materials synthesis and computation. Part of the students' training also includes participation in outreach activities through summer research opportunities to inspire high school students from the nearby city of Moreno Valley, which has a large percentage of minorities, to pursue STEM majors. This project also has an educational component which aims to implement a new materials chemistry class into the chemistry curriculum of these Moreno Valley high schools.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>This NSF CAREER project combines experiment and theory towards the designed preparation and thorough characterization of new complex transition metal-rich borides, in which structural transformations associated with changes in magnetic behaviors such as magnetic ordering transitions and magnetic frustration are anticipated. The first class of materials to be investigated contains ladders of magnetically active transition metals interacting with linear clusters of four boron atoms, an unforeseen interaction with the potential of drastically impacting the magnetic properties of these materials. In the second class of materials, interconnected iron triangular clusters leading to 1D, 2D and 3D substructures, which are geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, will be studied. Also, structural transformations are expected and will be investigated. Experimental investigations encompass solid state chemistry synthesis, crystal growth, elemental analysis, magnetization measurements, as well as X-ray and neutron diffraction. Density functional theory calculations will be used to study the electronic structure, chemical bonding and magnetic properties of the experimentally found new compounds and to predict new synthetic targets. The combination of experiment and theory in this project will provide the graduate and undergraduate students involved with a truly interdisciplinary problem. They will learn how experiment and theory impact each other towards advancing scientific knowledge."

The Standard Model of particle physics provides a remarkably successful description of the fundamental building blocks of Nature and the forces acting among them.  The absence of clear experimental evidence thus far for physics beyond the Standard Model challenges the idea of ""naturalness"" as the guiding principle in the search for new physics. It is therefore becoming more and more crucial to broadly explore new regimes of physics beyond the Standard Model.  The research of Professor Altmannshofer will serve the national interest by advancing our understanding of the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions.  In particular, his research aims to address the following fundamental questions:  Is the Higgs boson the origin of mass of all the known elementary matter particles?  Are there new fundamental forces among elementary particles beyond the strong, the weak, and the electromagnetic interactions?  Do elementary matter particles posses characteristic properties other than their mass and interactions that allow us to distinguish them?  As part of the proposed program, Professor Altmannshofer will also strengthen and extend the existing particle-physics outreach program at the Physics Department of the University of Cincinnati.  Students and teachers from local high schools will be invited to the department to participate in hands-on activities and to learn about the latest cutting-edge developments in particle physics.<br/> <br/>More technically, Professor Altmannshofer will construct and classify novel frameworks of mass generation for the light quarks and leptons and identify their characteristic signatures at high-energy and high-intensity experiments.  He will also develop new ways to search for feeble interactions among leptons and neutrinos at current and future neutrino facilities at Fermilab.  Furthermore, he will develop sophisticated methods to search for new sources of flavor and CP violation using rare b hadron decays that largely eliminate hadronic uncertainties.  Without such methods, the new physics sensitivity of rare b decays is limited by poorly understood hadronic contributions, and current hints for anomalies in the rare b decay data cannot be clarified.  Professor Altmannshofer's research program will provide several new and improved search strategies for physics beyond the Standard Model that are critical in enhancing the prospects for discovery at the energy and intensity frontiers."

They can be just a few nanometers in size, or about 100,000 thinner than a sheet of paper, and they can be formed from many different types of materials, including semiconductors.  When the electrons are squeezed into very small semiconductor nanocrystals, they become quantum-confined and new properties emerge, which can be harnessed for use in new technologies. Before proceeding to applications, researchers must learn how to pack the quantum dots (QDs) together into solids so that one nanoparticle can share its electrons with another.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Jin Z. Zhang and Yuan Ping from University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) are studying QD solids formed from a new class of semiconductors called perovskites.  Unlike traditional semiconductors, such as silicon, perovskites are a mixture of inorganic components and organic molecules and this gives rise to unusual properties.  Working with their students, Professors Zhang and Pin are developing ways to create stable QD solids where the electrons are easily shared.  Their discoveries could impact applications ranging from quantum computing to solar cells. The project also provides training opportunities for future scientists in advanced experimental and computational techniques.  Through their ""The Sun, Spectroscopy, and Santa Cruz"" events held each summer, the research groups are introducing the project to local high school students and teachers to enhance public awareness about science. <br/><br/>The research team is developing novel semiconductor QD solids based on metal halide (MH) perovskites. This research addressws the challenge that charge transport properties of QD solids are often limited due to weak coupling between QDs, hindering device applications in emerging technologies. The project is systematically studying the fundamental factors, such as size, shape and surface, that determine the electronic coupling between perovskite QDs (PQDs) by developing designer ligands that enhance both the coupling between the PQDs and their stability. The coupling between PDQs and interaction between ligands are characterized using a combination of time-resolved photoluminescence, transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and ultrafast pump-probe methods. Unique conductive or aromatic ligand molecules are expected to both stabilize the QDs and enhance their electronic coupling so that the QD solids will exhibit strong charge transport while maintaining the novel properties of the QDs. Computational studies based on state-of-the-art quantum mechanical methods are exploring the ligand-PQD interaction and inter-PQD coupling to guide and corroborate experimental studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer-aided simulation is a cost-friendly tool for the studies of these challenging interface problems. To approximate the governing mathematical equations of these systems, Virtual element method (VEM) is an emerging powerful tool in the scientific computing community. The objective of this research project is to develop both theoretical and practical aspects of various VEMs. Being able to reliably answer the question ""can we trust our simulation results?"" justifies the use of VEMs in simulating these complex systems. Meanwhile, this project strives to provide the public with a state-of-the-art VEM computer program that saves valuable computing resources. In addition, this research project creates opportunities to pass the torch on to graduate students to become the next generation computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>Solving elliptic partial differential equations with high-contrast diffusion coefficients play a central role in the modeling these complex systems. This project shall develop an in-depth robust a priori error analysis of VEM on elliptic interface problems. Different from the existing VEM analysis, this project devises a new novel paradigm to study the error analysis for the interface VEM, and further clarifies the dependence of the VEM convergence on the polytopal mesh geometries, justifying the VEM's applicability on interface-fitted mesh which may become extremely irregular or degenerate near the interfaces. Meanwhile, this project learns from the novelty of VEM framework to improve the analyses of traditional approaches for interface problems. The VEM's meta-formulation for elliptic problems enables us to construct immersed finite element spaces naturally in higher order and/or in 3-D.  Higher order interface VEMs, the a posteriori error estimation, and the adaptive polytopal mesh refinement are to be studied to render VEM more efficient and effective. This integrated study enables us to attack the challenging 3-D interface problems, which, in turn, broadens the scope in terms of both theory and tools for the whole numerical partial differential equation community. Last but not least, a portable and highly-vectorized VEM software library shall be made publicly available, including the semi-structured interface-fitted mesh generation, vectorized assembling, polytopal adaptivity, and fast multigrid solvers. The portability of the computer code enables the researchers to incorporate the VEM into existing software libraries dealing with interface problems, thus facilitating the interdisciplinary research in simulating those complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The problem of analyzing the dynamics of any such system becomes tractable if we recognize that individual components interact primarily with only a small number of ""nearby"" components. This is referred to as a quasi-locality property of the system. At the microscopic level, the basic laws of quantum physics govern the dynamics of systems consisting of atoms and elementary particles. Much of the recent progress made in understanding the dynamics of such systems has been through the mathematical analysis of their quasi-locality properties. In this project, new mathematical advances exploiting the quasi-locality properties of quantum systems will be used to obtain a better understanding of the physical systems of interest for new quantum technologies. In particular, new methods will be developed to allow more precise modeling of the quantum systems employed for quantum information processing and computation.<br/><br/>Quantum many-body systems at low temperatures describe a fascinating array of behavior generically described as quantum states of matter. This project will deepen the mathematical understanding of so-called gapped phases. Systems in a gapped phase have one or more ground states and a spectral gap for excitations in the bulk. One important goal of the project is to understand how the excitation spectrum of such systems can be described as a system of quasi-particles. In particular for systems in two space dimensions these quasi-particles may be anyons, instead of the more commonly encountered fermions and bosons. Techniques will be developed, based on the fundamental quasi-locality properties of the dynamics, to prove the existence of anyons, their relation to topological order in the ground state(s), and their dynamical properties.

If we detect this radio emission from a planet, we learn that it has a magnetosphere that can shield the planet from outside radiation and protect any biology that could be present. The investigator will use the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array radio telescope to search for these signals from 2500 planetary systems continuously over 5 years.

Planetary magnetospheres serve as shields for potential biospheres from harmful high-energy particles from the host star and beyond.

At absolute zero temperature, such systems can organize into myriad quantum states of matter---quantum phases---depending on details of interactions between particles.  While the most common of such phases and their transformations are well understood, some quantum phase transitions do not fit into conventional paradigms, most notably continuous transitions between phases with mismatched orders as can occur in quantum magnets.  Yet another class of phases---so-called gapless spin liquids with emergent itinerant quasiparticles---are proposed to occur in several antiferromagnetic solids that defy ordering even at zero temperature.  (Here, ""liquid"" refers to randomness in the directions of the electrons' magnetism inside a solid.)  The PI's group will pursue tractable examples of such unusual quantum phase transitions in one and two dimensions and also questions motivated by recent experiments in candidate spin-liquid materials.<br/><br/>A different aspect of collective quantum behavior is evolution in time when a system of many particles is started in a non-equilibrium state with finite energy density above zero temperature.  This has come to the fore as experimentalists are engineering systems with many degrees of freedom that behave quantum-mechanically, in part in an effort to develop quantum technologies.  A fundamental idea to describe such an evolution is that of dynamical thermalization and the closely related eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which offers a way of understanding why time flows only in one direction.  A notable exception to thermalization---so-called many-body localization---occurs in the presence of a large number of impurities.  A challenging question, also of technological interest, is whether thermalization can be completely or at least very strongly suppressed in the absence of impurities.  The PI's group will continue work on understanding pre-thermalization phenomena and also on so-called quantum many-body scar states that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.<br/><br/>Projects under this award will initiate graduate students to research at the frontier of quantum many-particle physics and will teach them a variety of analytical and numerical approaches that will prepare them for future careers in quantum physics and quantum engineering areas.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research studying different facets of quantum many-body physics: 1) unconventional quantum phase transitions and critical phases at zero temperature, and 2) unusual thermalization dynamics at non-zero energy density above zero temperature.<br/><br/>1) While by now we have good ``fixed-point'' pictures of myriad gapped phases, both conventional and exotic, we do not have as good an understanding of quantum phase transitions in many cases.  Among these, so-called ``deconfined quantum critical points'' that lie beyond the Landau paradigm have fascinated researchers for more than fifteen years; however, finding truly controlled instances of such critical points has been controversial.  Another challenging open problem is the description of gapless fractionalized phases, which are believed to be critical phases that do not require fine-tuning.  The PI's group will search for tractable examples of unconventional quantum critical points in low dimensions and will also pursue projects motivated by recent experiments in candidate gapless spin-liquid materials.<br/><br/>2) This award will also pursue research in quantum many-body dynamics and thermalization in closed quantum systems.  For many years, the interest in such questions had been primarily theoretical, as they relate to foundations of statistical mechanics and notions of quantum chaos.  However, modern experiments in engineered quantum systems such as cold atom arrays, trapped ions, dipolar spin impurities, etc., have already achieved well-isolated systems with many quantum degrees of freedom, and are already finding unexpected phenomena opening new exciting directions in the field.  In this context, the PI's group will specifically pursue examples of unusual thermalization in systems without disorder and will explore questions of pre-thermalization and quantum many-body scar states.  The PI's group studies concrete systems to address challenging open questions and combines and develops both analytical and numerical tools to achieve this.<br/><br/>Projects under this award will initiate graduate students to research at the frontier of condensed-matter physics.  The students will learn a variety of analytical and numerical approaches to quantum many-body systems that will prepare them for future careers in quantum physics and quantum engineering areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The range of such materials that are only one or a few atoms thick has now expanded to encompass 2D semiconductors, metals, and insulators. The unique combination of electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of these materials has opened up many new scientific frontiers and led to the development of a variety of nanoscale devices - from transistors to light emitting diodes and sensors. Critical to the further development of the field is the ability to manipulate the way electrons behave in these materials, particularly by controlling their available energy levels. The electronic properties of a material are normally altered by modifying the material itself, for example, by changing the material's chemical composition. This project explores a new approach to controlling the behavior of electrons in 2D materials. Rather than changing the material itself, the energy levels in the 2D material are modified by changing the surrounding media. For 2D materials that are only one or a few atoms thick, the external environment actually modifies the forces acting between electrons within the layer and, hence, changes the available energy levels for electrons. The research examines both uniform and nanostructured environments as a means of developing building blocks for a new class of nanoscale electronic and optical devices. Graduate students and undergraduate interns involved in the project learn to prepare, characterize, and analyze 2D materials and devices. Important professional development activities include frequent presentations of their own research and other technical topics within the group and in departmental forums at Stanford University. <br/><br/>Technical description: A critical factor for the development of the field of atomically thin two-dimensional 2D materials is the control of their band gap on the nanoscale. This is essential to explore the fundamental physical properties of the materials and to realize many technological applications, ranging from tuning the photon energy of light emission to the control of the transport characteristics by lateral junctions. Traditional approaches, like alloying, are, however, difficult to implement on the nanoscale. This project takes advantage of the pronounced influence of non-local dielectric screening in the limit of atomically thin materials to tune externally many-body Coulomb interactions in 2D semiconductors. This allows tuning of the band structure and band gap of the 2D material simply by tailoring its dielectric environment. The research involves three distinct components: (1) Systematic assembly of 2D heterostructures with varying band gaps and environmental screening; (2) real-space profiling of the band gap at abrupt discontinuities and study of localization for 0D and 1D structures; and (3) determination of conduction and valence band offsets across dielectrically engineered junctions. Characterization tools for these investigations include optical spectroscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy."

The rate and accuracy of these detections will improve as LIGO is upgraded. By comparing the detected waves with detailed predictions of the waves, scientists can measure properties (locations, masses, spins) of the black holes and learn about how they might have formed and how they warp space and time as they collide.  The predictions are made using the equations of General Relativity, written down by Einstein in 1915 but unsolvable (for colliding black holes) until about 2005 with the development of advanced methods and powerful supercomputers. This project supports theoretical work designed to underpin and improve LIGO's ability to extract from observed GWs the rich information that the waves carry.  This includes the improvement and use of the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), currently the most accurate computer code for solving Einstein's equations for black hole binaries. SpEC will be used to carry out numerical solutions of black-hole collisions for the purpose of analyzing LIGO data.  In addition, a new computer code SpECTRE will be developed; this is a next-generation upgrade of SpEC designed for new upcoming computer architectures and accuracies beyond those of current codes. SpECTRE will be used to predict gravitational waveforms from two colliding neutron stars and from a black hole colliding with a neutron star.  Gravitational waves from neutron-star collisions are expected to be observed by LIGO, and can teach scientists about how matter behaves at ultra-high densities.

The next-generation open-source code SpECTRE will be developed for numerical relativity simulations with matter and radiation. SpECTRE uses Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. It is designed for high accuracy and high scalability on current and future supercomputers by following a novel task-based parallelization paradigm. SpECTRE's initial version already implements general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. It will be upgraded to handle the dynamical space  times of neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, including nuclear-theory based hot equations of state and neutrinos. SpECTRE will be applied to studies of BH and accretion disk formation to understand dynamics and GW emission.

A combination of experimental and theoretical techniques will be used to explore the molecular mechanisms by which eye lens proteins from different organisms maintain transparency.  The scientific goal is to understand how nature produces transparent, durable biomaterials, as exemplified by the proteins making up the eye lens. The lenses of animals that live in very hot, cold, or UV light-saturated environments can provide a guide to making robust, biodegradable materials that withstand harsh conditions.  The knowledge gained from this project will guide the design of flexible materials with potential applications to new biomimetic lens designs, in both the medical and analytical chemistry contexts, flexible microlenses, and self-healing materials that resist UV-light damage. In the future, it could enable the development of bioinorganic hydrogel scaffolds, controllable membraneless bioreactors, and ocean-safe, biodegradable sunscreen. The educational plan includes training of students at the Ph.D. and undergraduate levels. These students will be trained not only in the specific skills needed to complete the research, but also in critical thinking, scientific communication, and problem solving across disciplinary boundaries.  Another important component is outreach to middle school and high school students in grades 6-12. The goal of the outreach program is to increase interest in science as a career among middle school students. The students, many of whom are from disadvantaged economic backgrounds, visit UCI to participate in a campus tour where they learn about undergraduate life, perform hands-on activities in the investigators? laboratories, and interact with undergraduate researchers.  <br/>?<br/>Technical summary<br/>The objective of this project is to understand the solubility and stability of proteins that are adapted to resist extreme environments.  Experimental and modeling studies of highly stable structural proteins that play the same functional role in very different environments will provide insight into sequence determinants of stability and solubility. Structural and refractive proteins are chosen specifically to avoid interference from sequence features that are conserved to maintain chemical activity in thermostable enzymes. The scientific goal of this project is to understand how nature produces transparent, durable biomaterials, as exemplified by the proteins making up the eye lens. Although the molecular details of these proteins vary among different organisms, they are functionally similar in their high stability and resistance to temperature extremes. The specific proteins chosen for this effort are eye lens crystallins that are adapted to extreme environments. The J2 crystallin from the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora and the ??-crystallin from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis are extremely stable with respect to heat denaturation. These proteins are not homologous but share a common function; we seek to understand the sequence and structural determinants of thermal stability. On the other hand, the ?S- and ?M-crystallins from the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) resist cold cataract at -2 C or lower, far below the temperature at which mammalian lenses undergo cold cataract. These proteins exist in a complex mixture, with 13 paralogs in the fish lens. One goal is to understand and control the liquid-liquid phase separation involved in cold cataract. The iota-crystallin from the diurnal gecko Lygodactylus picturatus binds a modified form of the visual pigment retinol to protect its retinae from UV light damage in bright sunlight.  NMR and optical spectroscopy, light scattering, and directed mutagenesis experiments will be coupled with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate the important structural factors and intermolecular interactions that confer high stability and resistance to extreme conditions on these proteins, guiding the future design of biomimetic materials. Understanding the structural factors diverse lens proteins have in common will help guide the design of future temperature- and UV-resistant biomimetic materials. Furthermore, the ability to predict and control the formation and dissociation of liquid-liquid phase separation in protein mixtures will be useful for modulating protein aggregation and biochemical activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Shenvi and his team are developing new chemical reactions to force two molecules to bond between crowded atoms. Over the last four decades, organic chemists have learned how to connect relatively simple, flat (two-dimensional) rings of atoms. Connecting three-dimensional rings, however, remains challenging, especially when the atoms that constitute the connection points are crowded or possess different geometries. Some of the most complex molecules found in nature exhibit these congested, attached-ring structures, yet there are few good ways to make them in the laboratory. In this project, the Shenvi group is developing ways to synthesize molecules with attached-rings and apply the new methods to making molecules with potential biological applications. For example, the target molecules, Illicium terpenes, are approved by the FDA to treat peripheral arterial disease.  Professor Shenvi teaches advanced topics in chemical synthesis, mentors summer undergraduate researchers, and conducts public outreach in science education. <br/><br/>Professor Shenvi and his students are exploring two reactions capable of forging challenging attached-ring motifs from simple building blocks. In the first area of study, the group is developing an understanding of the very low energy barrier to butenolide heterocoupling, which establishes polyfunctional attached rings bearing vicinal, fully-substituted carbons. The origin of specificity and selectivity is being investigated and applied to the synthesis of Illicium terpenes. In the second area of study, the group is developing a catalytic cross-coupling method that alters the normal steric demand for arylation reactions. Application to the synthesis of attached rings embedded within polycyclic alkaloids is being explored. This work is helping to expand the repertoire of chemical reactions that can forge attached rings beyond biaryls, which heavily populate synthetic libraries, and where sp3-sp3 attached ring motifs are underrepresented.

In both experiments the PI and students apply many cycles of driving, making microscopic and mechanical observations to test how these systems are changed and programmed by the driving. The main goal is to test and develop the idea that there exist generic classes of memory behavior. Specifically, the two experimental systems feature comparable yielding and depinning transitions, and so are an opportunity to connect common physics to a common class of memory. The PI's main goal is a deeper understanding of how processing and environment can program the structure and behavior of matter. Undergraduate students play an integral role in experiments and analysis, and as part of this project the PI creates additional laboratory experiences, public outreach opportunities, and professional development opportunities for a broader array of Cal Poly students."

Nanoclusters that consist of fewer than ~200 metallic atoms are of interest due to their luminescence in near-infrared light, bio-compatibility and ultra-small size. The relationship between the structure and optical properties of these nanoclusters remains unclear, which prevents the design of nanoclusters with optimized performance. This program uses pressure to modify the structure of nanoclusters, in order to learn about the electronic transitions that are responsible for light absorption and luminescence, as well as the stability of nanoclusters under external stimulus. This research is closely tied to our educational plans through the training of postdocs and graduate students, by supporting underrepresented groups at the K-12 and college level in science and technology, and by supporting science teachers in the community. In addition, modules that explain the influence of mechanics on optical behavior will be incorporated into undergraduate courses during this program.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The proposed research is concerned with characterizing the properties of atomically precise clusters composed of gold or silver plus ligands using diamond anvil cell techniques to apply high pressure, and with optical measurements (both absorption and emission) to study excited states.  The experiments will be modeled using electronic structure theory, including ground state calculations to determine structures, and excited state studies to determine optical properties, and including methods development based on second linear response theory and domain-separated density functional theory.  The research is aimed at identifying optical properties such as plasmon to exciton transitions, and an increase in luminescence efficiency with increasing pressure; both properties are of interest to using the clusters in practical applications.  The research includes three research objectives: (1) study of energy transfer responsible for broad absorption & near-infrared luminescence of the cluster material under pressure, (2) determine the source of anomalous multiple emissions of the nanoclusters, and (3) studies of 2-3 nm nanoclusters to characterize the transition from plasmonic to excitonic states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By colliding elementary particles against each other at high energies, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. Collimated jets of hadrons are a dominant feature of high-energy particle interactions, and are copiously produced at the LHC.  The research of Professor Kang is focused on understanding the production of these strongly interacting particles, from which important information can be extracted.  Jets constitute unique opportunities to explore the dynamics of the strong interaction and to study the fundamental properties of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new physical law.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Kang will involve graduate students in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and develop new course curricula based on results from the LHC.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Kang will develop theoretical tools to perform accurate QCD phenomenology at the LHC, especially for inclusive and heavy flavor tagged jets and their substructure.  He will also perform studies for heavy quarkonium production by making use of a novel fragmentation function approach within QCD factorization.  In addition, he will combine the frameworks of heavy quarkonium physics and jet substructure in order to achieve a better understanding of the production and polarization of heavy quarkonium at the LHC, which is currently one of the most intriguing puzzles in the field."

The equations that describe these systems are often difficult to solve directly, so new tools and techniques are needed to study them. This project is centered around a toolcalled ""contact homology""thathas produced powerful insights into many kinds of dynamical systems in recent years.Contact homology provides a framework for finding features of a dynamical system that are conserved even as the parameters of the dynamical system are allowed to vary. In this way, complicated systems can be studied by continuously changing the system into a more basic form,and then using knowledge of the dynamics in this simplerstate to learn about the structure of the original system. This project aims to further develop the foundations of contact homologyand to use it to produce new insights about dynamics. An example of an expected application is the discovery of newperiodic trajectories for many dynamical systems, whichare configurations of the system that re-occur infinitely often in time. An expected educational impact is the fostering of new opportunitiesfor research training for undergraduates.  In this area the PI plans to continue his efforts, which have led to two publications by undergraduates in peer-reviewed journals in the last several years. The PI also plans to continue his commitment toreach broader segments of the public, for example through participation in prison education initiatives and through outreach to local high schools. In a different direction, the PI plans to continue conversations with researchers in other fields of science to find new collaborative opportunities. The PI will disseminate the results of the project as broadly as possible, for example through organizing conferences and through effective use of online tools.<br/><br/>To elaborate on the scientific merit of the project, previous work of the PI used a special kind of contact homology, called embedded contact homology (ECH), to show that any vector field of Reeb type on a closed three-manifold has at least two distinct periodic orbits. In fact, evidence suggests that stronger results hold, and in the current project the PI and collaborators plan to show in many cases that a Reeb vector field with more than two closed orbits has infinitely many. Insights into Reeb dynamics also come from the closely related field of symplectic embedding problems, and this project will pursue several lines of inquiry in this direction, for example one thread involves better understanding the number theoretic aspects of four-dimensional embedding problems while another involves finding new obstructions to symplectic embeddings in higher dimensions. New combinatorial tools are expected to be useful for these investigations, so the PIplans to continue developing an irrational version of the classical Ehrhart theory familiar from the theory of lattice point enumeration. More speculative directions of the project involveestablishing new formulas for the asymptotics of the ECH spectrum andfurther developing the foundations of embedded contact homology by applying new tools for regularizing moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves."

In condensed matter, strong interactions determine the formation of topological phases giving materials unexpected physical properties that could revolutionize technology through robustness to noise and disorder. In quantum chemistry, determining the electronic structure of molecules is a problem of strongly correlated matter that establishes the static, dynamic and interaction properties of molecules as well as being key in tackling questions ranging from basic biology to translational medicine. This project will tackle these problems through the analog and digital simulation of their quintessential strongly-interacting properties on an apparatus with ultracold neutral atoms in optical tweezers. In the analog simulations, all the physics of the strongly correlated systems will be simultaneously emulated or mimicked, while the digital version will use a stroboscopic approach. The breadth and depth of this project, both in experimental tools and novel theoretical developments, will provide a rich educational environment for students at all levels and from all backgrounds, and inspire them to purse creative scientific careers in industry and academia. This environment will reach far beyond the research through a program for middle and high school students, the Young Physicist Program, by bringing the students to the University of California - San Diego labs and facilities to learn about fundamental topics in the quantifiable world via simplified college-level laboratories and interactive demonstrations.<br/><br/><br/>This project will use ultracold fermionic strontium atoms in polychromatic optical tweezers and beams to realize an analog simulator of fractional Chern insulators and to demonstrate the building blocks of a digital simulator of many-body fermionic open systems. The simulation of the topological insulating state will follow an optical flux approach, which engineers the lattice in reciprocal space through polychromatic beams driving a manifold of Raman transitions, and will benefit from ultracold strontium's low temperatures and reduced heating by spontaneous emission. The digital simulator, on the other hand, uses a stroboscopic approximation of the many-body Hamiltonian, or Liouvillian for open systems, through a set of elementary operations, much like a quantum computer, but with fermions instead of qubits, and arbitrary hopping and interactions between fermionic modes, instead of qubit gates. Polychromatic and mobile tweezers will exquisitely trap and precisely transport strontium atoms, both tasks achieved selectively for atoms in their ground or long-lived excited states. The prospects of exquisitely controlling, manipulating and interacting single fermions would exceed by far that achieved over the last two decades of doing the same with qubits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach is to embed, within the tissue, microscopic sensors that can be stretched, compressed and deformed by cell-generated forces. By recording these sensor shape changes with microscopy, the cell-generated forces can be measured over time.  One barrier to developing this technology is the lack of robust, non-toxic, polymeric materials for use as sensors.  This project aims to address this challenge by developing a fundamental understanding of how polymer composition and processing control the structural and mechanical properties of hydrogels. The results of this work will enable the design and manufacturing of hydrogel-based materials for specific sensing applications, and will establish predictive relationships between sensor shape and applied force. The knowledge and materials developed through this award will promote their use in tissue engineering and reconstruction, bioengineering devices, and medical diagnostics.

Mass spectrometry is a technique that separates molecules or atoms according to their mass and electrical charge.  Photoelectron spectroscopy is a technique that uses light (typically from a laser) to eject electrons from atoms or molecules. The energy of the ejected electrons gives information about how strongly the electron was bound to the molecule. Professor Sztray combines these two techniques to form photoelectron-photo-ion coincidence spectroscopy or ""PEPICO"", which provides a much more detailed molecular fingerprint, and enables the analysis of gaseous mixtures of many components. With a prototype instrument in Switzerland and with a new Sandia National Lab apparatus at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley, reactions of unstable intermediate species, relevant in combustion, atmospheric, or interstellar environments are studied. The students involved in this project are receiving training in a cutting-edge experimental, highly collaborative environment.  As the research in the Sztray laboratory involves custom-built instruments, graduate student researchers learn unique design and fabrication skills which are highly valued in the high-tech sector.  Graduate and undergraduate researchers also have opportunities to work with collaborators at US National Laboratories (Sandia and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories) as well as international facilities (Swiss Light Source).<br/><br/>In PEPICO coincidence detection, each photoelectron is ""labeled"" with the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the photoion it corresponds to, essentially combining the advantages of mass spectrometry and photoelectron spectroscopy. Using a side-sampled, pulsed-laser photolysis flow-tube reactor, the project focuses on the spectroscopy and thermochemistry of elusive intermediates, such as alkylperoxy and hydroperoxyalkyl radicals, ketohydroperoxides and Criegee intermediates. Utilizing the isomer selectivity of PEPICO detection, a systematic study is conducted on the reactions of small carbon-containing radicals with small hydrocarbons. Recombination reactions of propargyl, allyl, and benzyl radicals play a crucial role in molecular weight growth processes that ultimately lead to soot formation. Here, PEPICO detection offers a step forward in understanding these reactive pathways and providing isomer selective branching ratios and reaction rates. Ultimately, by identifying key intermediates, their reaction mechanisms, and rates, more complete combustion models can be constructed, leading to better predictions of combustion products, including gaseous and aerosol pollutants.  These predictions can then aid  in the development of low-emission engine technologies."

The overall goal of the conference is to study interactions between the two areas of mathematics in the title. <br/><br/>""Topology"" is the study of shapes that are allowed to stretch and bend. For example, a triangle and circle are considered to be topologically equivalent because one can be stretched into the other, and similarly a cube and sphere are considered topologically equivalent. ""Low dimensional topology"" studies shapes or objects in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, such as surfaces, or knotted loops in 3-dimensional space. This can be useful in other sciences; for example, DNA can be knotted, or the shape of the universe could have a nontrivial topology. ""Representation theory"" is the study of symmetries in mathematics, and at a concrete level, these symmetries often manifest themselves as solutions to systems of equations where the variables represent matrices instead of numbers. This mathematical area has also had applications in other sciences, such as symmetries of elementary particles in physics, or symmetries of molecules in<br/>chemistry. There are sophisticated mathematical techniques for taking certain spaces of solutions to polynomial equations and producing solutions to matrix equations, and recently low dimensional topology has been used to find solutions to the same equations, using completely different mathematical constructions. One of the goals of the conference is to understand this new phenomenon using ideas coming from mathematical physics. This award will fund participation of early career US scientists in this summer school and conference so they can learn about these exciting new ideas.More details about the conference are available at https://www.icms.org.uk/geometricrepresentation.php.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Professor Garg is merging chemical synthesis with synthesis by enzymes isolated from nature, leading to versatile and streamlined procedures that could have impacts beyond the specific molecules that are being studied. Professor Garg and his graduate students perform chemistry and science demonstrations for young children in the Los Angeles community, specifically to the UCLA Krieger Daycare and Warner Elementary School.

Professor Garg is studying the first total synthesis of strictosidine via a combined chemo-enzymatic approach. He and his team are also pursuing the synthesis of a complex hydrocarbon that is of longstanding scientific interest and is a notorious challenge for synthetic chemistry.

To draw an analogy with ecology, this change in perspective is akin to the realization that, in order to understand the movement of a single fish in the sea, it helps a great deal to understand how that fish interacts with the other members of their school. In mathematics, the notion of a moduli space loosely refers to an entire family of objects; for example, in the fish analogy, the moduli space could refer to the entire school of fish. Moduli spaces can, themselves, be treated as a single entity, comprised of many, and we can learn about the objects we are interested in by studying the shape of the moduli space that parametrizes them. It can be especially enlightening to understand the shape of moduli spaces near their boundary, and the research supported by this NSF award is driven by the goal of understanding the shape of the boundary of a number of moduli spaces that parametrize different types of families of algebraic curves. This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research aspects in this project fall into three interrelated categories, all with the common theme of investigating various compact moduli spaces of curves and what geometric and enumerative information can be gleaned from the structure of their boundary. In the first line of problems, the PI will study new classes of moduli spaces that can be realized as wonderful compactifications associated to certain complex reflection groups. These new moduli spaces provide a fertile testing ground for investigating the extent to which polyhedral methods can be generalized beyond toric varieties. In the second line of problems, the PI will introduce moduli spaces into the study of factorization problems in complex reflection groups. In particular, the primary objective is to study the polynomial structure of factorizations by constructing a suitable compactification of the associated moduli spaces of admissible covers. In the final line of problems, the PI will initiate a study of the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of pseudo-stable curves. These spaces provide alternative compactifications of the moduli spaces of curves that allow for curves with cuspidal singularities, instead of the usual nodal singularities, and progress in this research would lead to advances concerning the enumerative geometry of curves with cuspidal singularities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A strategic combination of chemical, biochemical and spectroscopic approaches will then be used to analyze these defined snapshots in hopes of (1) obtaining insights into the C1 pathway that converts CO to CH4; (2) defining the C1 conformation for the binding and coupling of the second CO; and (3) identifying the mechanism of carbon chain extension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program also provides a one month long intensive summer immersion for its participants at an established summer REU site at Fresno State. FURST students get an opportunity to participate in professional workshops, presentations and academic discussions along with the REU students, whereas FURST faculty can take advantage of an on-site, in-person research collaboration with their peers within the FURST program. The program's main goal is to foster both student and faculty research at PUIs, with the specific goal of producing student and faculty authored publications, as well as presentations. The program is designed to be inclusive and accessible to teams from institutions with varying research focus and support, in order to mitigate cultural changes at institutions which may not consider research a quintessential component of higher education.<br/><br/>FURST students will be working on open problems in mathematics under the guidance of their faculty mentors. Research topics include community detection problems in networks, expanding the framework and analysis of the cop and robber game, the use of coarse Ricci curvature in data analysis and interpolation problems, the study and solution of the non-linear Riccati-Ermakov equation, as well as other non-linear dispersive partial differential equations. Strengthening their background in the selected research topic through readings and lecture at their home institutions will prepare FURST students to engage in research at the same speed as the REU students during the immersion phase. Students will be expected to submit the end product of their research for publication in a peer reviewed journal. FURST faculty will engage in solving open problems in their area of research while building collaborations with faculty at other institutions. Faculty are also expected to produce publishable work as a result of participating in the program. In accordance with the stated goals, the program will improve access to research for students at PUIs, where such opportunities are typically limited. It will also (re)-energize faculty at PUIs so that they remain active in research. By doing so, FURST will help transform the research culture at the participating institutions, especially since the bulk of the research activities will take place at FURST teams' home institutions. While FURST student participants will learn skills through the program that are invaluable in graduate school and in the scientific workplace, the program will broadly impact the students at the involved PUIs by demonstrating to them (through student talks and presentations) that research can be part of the undergraduate educational experience. Finally, through the immersion in an active REU site, FURST students will gain exposure to the workings of an REU program, and will be able to make better informed choices about applying to REU as a potential next step in their academic development."

The technique in development will allow him to obtain spectral signatures of individual molecules for identification purposes as well as the spatial location of these molecules. Moreover, his approach collects data at a much faster speed than what currently feasible, e.g positions of millions of single molecules in dense samples can be collected in minutes. The technique, once developed, will be a very powerful approach for the study of single molecules in a complex environment. For example, it can be used to study uneven distribution of molecules at nanometer scales or to monitor molecule-nanostructure interactions in real time, which cannot yet be achieved by existing techniques. This new measurement capability will find many applications in chemistry, biophysics, cell biology, and materials science. Professor Xu is also interested in integrating what he learns from research into his teaching. He is developing new courses on advanced microscopy and single-molecule spectroscopy for students who are interested. He is also passionate in mentoring students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, by serving as a Faculty Mentor to Regents' and Chancellor's (RC) and Cal Opportunity (CalOp) Scholars on campus. Professor Xu and his graduate students are teaming up with Bay Area Scientists in Schools (BASIS), a local volunteer program, to develop new science demos and teaching materials for local, underprivileged public schools.<br/><br/>Professor Xu is working to overcome the limitations of modern super high resolution optical imaging techniques by bringing together the spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions of single-molecule spectroscopy. Indeed, current approaches for the measurement of the fluorescence spectra of single molecules are limited by low throughput and spatial resolution. Meanwhile, emerging super-resolution microscopy methods offer outstanding spatial resolution but no spectral information. Through the development of a new scheme to spectrally disperse the fluorescence of single molecules in the wide-field and achieving molecular sparseness via photoswitching, Xu's approach enables concurrent spectral measurement and super-localization of single molecules with ultrahigh throughput (millions of molecules in a few minutes). Such spectrally-resolved super-resolution microscopy capabilities would offer spectral information for large amount of single molecules together with nanometer spatial resolution. It can therefore enable the interrogation of the behavior of single molecules in different chemical environments, modeling lipid bilayers and cell plasma membranes, and revealing, in a spectrally and spatially resolved fashion, the mechanisms of single-molecule fluorescence enhancement by plasmonic nanostructures."

In addition, Dr. Pratt and his team wish to learn how the chemical modification, which occurs by addition of a sugar molecule to amino acid sites in the proteins, is associated with the death of biological cells. This sugar modification of certain proteins inside cells has been shown to lower the likelihood of a particular type of cellular death, called apoptosis. This programmed cell death pathway is fundamental to a wide variety of biological events and outcomes. Even though sugar modification of proteins controls programmed cell death, the exact details regarding the chemistry and biochemistry are unknown. The experiments proposed here test two relatively unexplored potential paths where the sugar modification may change the behavior of specific proteins, which lowers the likelihood of programmed cell death. Through parallel activities, experiments from the research project are integrated into an outreach program to create a protein science laboratory for high school students. <br/><br/>This research project aims to understand the direct consequences of O-GlcNAc modification on apoptosis-linked proteins. To accomplish this goal, synthetic protein chemistry will be used to prepare homogeneous and site-specifically modified proteins for biochemical study. This method enables the precise construction of O-GlcNAc modified proteins through the combination of recombinant protein expression and peptide synthesis. This method will be exploited in two ways. First, the effects of O-GlcNAc on an executioner of apoptosis, caspase-6, will be tested. Second, O-GlcNAcylation of the chaperone protein HSP27, which can inhibit apoptosis by preventing protein-protein interactions, will be explored. Information from this study will provide new insights into how O-GlcNAc can inhibit apoptosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By colliding subatomic elementary particles against each other at high energies, particle physicists hope to learn about the fundamental constituents of matter and energy in the universe.   During the award period, the LHC will commence a new experimental run which will collect substantially more data than has been available to date, significantly extending our reach for discovering new constituents of matter and uncovering new physical principles. Analyzing this data is in the national interest since it will promote the progress of fundamental science through the examination of the nature of matter at the shortest distance scales and elucidating the laws by which matter and energy interact. Through their research, Professors Simmons and Chivukula aim to construct and analyze new theories which describe the nature and properties of the so-called ""Higgs Boson"" discovered at the LHC and to delineate the best experimental analyses for swiftly and decisively understanding the nature of any new dynamics discovered at the LHC.  They will also explore the complementarity between LHC results and the data gathered from other experimental searches for new physics, including those designed to uncover the nature of the ""dark matter"" which comprises the majority of mass in our galaxy. This research will also have substantial broader impacts, including the development of new and continuing science courses at UC San Diego, public presentations on science to audiences of all ages, extensive work to improve the environment in physics for all participants, and continued service to the national and international physics community.  This research project will also involve students and postdoctoral researchers and thereby contribute to the training and development of the next generation of scientists in our nation.<br/><br/>More technically, Professors Simmons and Chivukula will extend their simplified-limits formalism to consider how best to combine LHC searches from various decay modes to uncover new resonances potentially decaying into multiple channels. They will apply their work on simplified limits to analyze non-resonant annihilation of dark matter particles in galactic halos and investigate how such methods can constrain (or discover) particulate dark matter. They will study the theory and phenomenology of top-partner states which are predicted in numerous composite Higgs models and examine novel strategies for discovering these states at the LHC. They will extend their work on Jet Energy Correlations to create sensitive new probes for discovering additional colored states at the LHC.

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to take advantage of the quantum properties of these molecules, one needs to learn how to prepare individual molecules in a single quantum state, and to measure which state they are in.  This will require absolute control over the movement and rotation of the molecule. Today, physicists can prepare atoms in single quantum states, and measure which state they are in with high fidelity. This ability underpins many of the recent advances in atomic physics. The ability to prepare and measure the state of molecules lags far behind, and no molecule containing more than two atoms has ever been prepared in a single quantum state. This project, funded by the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Program of the Division of Physics, and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program of the Division of Chemistry, develops the tools for this goal.  An important application of this work is that it will enable the identification of individual molecules without destroying them, including identifying the chirality of these molecules. Chirality is the subtle difference between left-handed or right-handed molecules that can play a big role in how the molecule functions, for example in pharmaceuticals. This work will be done by graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), including financially disadvantaged students enrolled in UCSB's EUREKA program. The program will allow these students to gain valuable, hands-on scientific skills while earning stipends that allow them to stay in school.<br/><br/>The scientists leading this research have proposed a set of methods that will allow them to control a broad range of molecular ions at the single quantum state level. The centerpiece of this proposal is a new state readout method, quantum bolometry, which leverages the rich internal level structure of these molecules to provide high-fidelity quantum state readout of individual molecules. A single molecular ion will be trapped in a hybrid Paul trap/optical lattice, along with a single laser-cooled strontium ion.  The molecular ion's motion will be driven via a combination of a state-dependent optical lattice and rotational transitions within the molecule which are driven directly via microwave-frequency electric fields. The method does not require sideband resolution or ground state cooling, in contrast to related quantum logic spectroscopy methods. Quantum bolometry can be applied to most reasonably small (4 - 15 atoms), nonspherical polyatomic ions. These methods will allow for non-destructive measurement of the isomer and enantiomer of individual molecules for the first time, and allow for spectroscopy with a resolution significantly greater than existing ensemble molecular spectroscopy techniques.  Spectroscopy at this level would represent our most accurate determination of molecular structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2017 the LSC, together with the Virgo collaboration, inaugurated the era of multi-messenger GW astronomy with the detection of the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger, GW170817. This is the dawn of a new and exciting era of astronomy, made possible by the organization and coherent vision of the LSC. The success of the LSC relies on a globally distributed team. Effective and efficient operations requires regular in-person meetings for planning and reviews. This project supports travel for the LSC Spokesperson and other members of the leadership team to participate in such activities and it also supports the LSC Fellows Program. This program attracts a diverse and skilled set of (mostly) junior researchers to work at each LIGO site. Participants monitor the quality of data during observation runs and work with local engineers and scientists to improve the performance of the interferometers. Participation by LSC members in on-site investigations helps improve the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors and increase their duty cycle; this extends the scientific reach of the detectors. Developing and maintaining a broad base of research scientists in the LSC that are trained in gravitational-wave science is essential for future observations.<br/><br/>This award supports core functions of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) in order to carry out its scientific mission of using gravitational-waves to explore the fundamental physics of gravity and as a new multi-messenger astronomical tool of discovery. The grant supports the U.S. portion of the LSC Activities Fees, which amounts to about 52% (444 of 884 members) of all fees collected. The LSC levies an Activities Fee on a per-member basis to fund key programs and functions deemed essential by the membership. These include the LSC Fellows Program, publication fees associated with collaboration papers, LSC service travel associated with organizational responsibilities, and LSC spokesperson's travel. About two thirds of the Activities Fee funds the LSC Fellows Program, which attracts a diverse and skilled set of (mostly) junior researchers to work at each LIGO site. The goals of the program are to provide opportunities for LSC members to learn about and contribute to LIGO's precision interferometery at the observatories, to have on-site LSC scientists monitoring the quality of data during observation runs, and to complement the activities of local engineers and scientists in improving the performance of the interferometers. The Activities Fee assessment ensures that the publication fees for collaboration papers, including fees to make seminal detection papers open-access, and LSC Spokesperson and other members' travel associated with organizational responsibilities, are distributed evenly among collaboration members. The fee also funds reliable internet hosting and identity services, both of which are crucial for a large collaboration such as the LSC. The LSC has a substantial positive impact on research, education and public understanding of science through its activities. The LSC trains junior scientists to understand the design and operations of the cutting-edge LIGO detectors. The experience gained through the LSC Fellows program significantly and positively impacts junior scientists' abilities to understand and communicate on highly technical topics; these are important skills both inside and outside academia. Students and junior researchers from smaller institutions, some of whom are under-represented minorities, gain access to resources that would otherwise be out of reach. In the long-term, there is significant benefit from training a larger and more diverse group of experimental scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimizing an accelerator's operational parameters is a complex problem, yet critical to achieve robust performance and to increase the number of circulating particles. Computer models will be developed in this project to investigate the possible configurations, set specifications, and estimate the system performance. Algorithms will also be created to operate the accelerator as efficiently as possible, thus increasing the discovery potential in accelerator experiments.  Student participation is an integral part of this project. The students will benefit from participating in cutting-edge research and having access to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. They will develop scientific programming and modeling skills, learn how to create and validate simulations, conduct measurements, and be involved with operations of complex accelerator systems. All of these experiences will be a realistic introduction to graduate work, and/or work in advanced industry in one of the many areas in which accelerators play a key role.<br/><br/>Innovative developments in a broad range of subfields of accelerator physics and technology will be required to achieve the beam specifications for the next generation accelerators. There are two major objectives in this project. First, a general model of the interaction between the next generation radio frequency (RF) system and the particle beam dynamics will be generated, which can be applied to future particle colliders and light sources. Second, this general model will be validated through application to a particular particle accelerator. The simulations of the next generation RF and low level radio frequency (LLRF) systems will be developed as block systems in the computer program Simulink. The simulation defining parameters and the initial conditions will be set in Matlab. Multi-particle simulations will also be developed in Python. The validation of models developed during this project will be done using the Large Hadron Collider crab cavity system, located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.   The validation process will involve conducting proof of principle simulations, investigating the LLRF-beam dynamics interaction, studying the LLRF implementation, examining detrimental effects, and developing control algorithms; thus expanding the deliverables of this project. This project will have a significant impact on advancing knowledge in accelerator physics. The knowledge and expertise developed will be directly applicable to future particle colliders and light sources."

Bowers at the University of California at Santa Barbara are investigating the mechanism of peptide assembly.  Peptide and protein assemblies can contribute to many devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease because of amyloid formation.  This is an active area of research both for its fundamental importance and its potential impacts on health.   Through the studies on model amino acids and peptides, factors that control larger peptide and protein assembly can be learned, which can help the development of new therapeutic agents.  The project is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels, including those underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities to high school students in the Ventura and Santa Barbara areas are also part of the funded project.  A free website that allows the accurate and rapid calculation of cross sections of model structures is also supported by this grant.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this grant is focused on the assembly of amino acids and small peptides.  In these studies, Ion Mobility based Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) is used as the main tool.  In collaboration with the group of Gert von Helden at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, IMS-MS is coupled with the Fritz Haber free electron laser to do spectroscopy on size and shape selected oligomers of both amino acids and small peptides.  The overarching goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of the amyloid cascade that is often observed for peptides and proteins in systems related to many devastating diseases.  The amyloid hypothesis states that peptides natively fold and isotropically assemble until at a system dependent size they rearrange to beta sheet and rapidly add monomers to form fibrils.  The group, in past NSF support periods, observed this process for specific peptide systems.  The current project seeks to understand these observations and to develop an algorithm that can accurately predict the predilection of a peptide or protein to form amyloid knowing only the primary structure."

State-of-the-art techniques developed in the Williams lab enable new measurements of the strength of ion-water interactions, how ions affect the structure of surrounding water molecules, how ions interact with other ions, and how water stabilizes ion charge.  These measurements provide new insights into important problems in chemistry where ions play a central role, such as ion-protein structural effects that are important in biochemistry, ion solvation that plays a central role in aerosol chemistry important in the atmosphere, electrochemistry that plays an important role in batteries and fuel cells, and desalination that will likely play an increasingly important role for providing a reliable source of fresh water.  They provide benchmarks that can help theoreticians improve computational methods aimed at a deeper understanding of various processes at the molecular level.  Students working in the laboratory learn about instrumentation, computational methods, and measurement science - training which prepares them for success in a wide variety of technical careers.  <br/><br/>Isolated nanodrops provide an ideal, well-controlled environment in which to study ion-water interactions.  These nanodrops are size-selected, and thermochemical information is obtained using a method developed in the lab called nanocalorimetry.  The accuracy of this nanocalorimetry method is being improved using UV laser light at various wavelengths for calibration.  The improved method is used to probe ion-electron recombination reactions, thereby obtaining electrochemical half-cell potentials previously immeasurable using conventional methods, and to establish an absolute electrochemical scale.  The concept of an absolute electrochemical scale has been hotly debated, but no definitive method for establishing such a scale currently exists.  The research also seeks to extend the wavelength range of infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in order to provide complementary information about how water molecules directly interact with ions and ion-pairs inside the nanodrops.  These methods are being used to improve understanding of the role of ion-water interactions for ions in the ""Hofmeister"" series, which orders ions based on their propensity to either stabilize or destabilize the native structures of proteins."

This study aims to investigate one such semimetal, SrMnSb2. It has been theoretically predicted that exposure to a short pulse of laser light might change the material's electronic properties, radically, rapidly and reversibly. This project exposes SrMnSb2 to laser pulses, following them up with several advanced optical and X-ray measurements to learn the pulses' influence on the material's atomic positions and electronic properties. This project supports undergraduate and post-doctoral researchers at a primarily-undergraduate institution, who operate laser experiments, participate in experiments at free-electron lasers and other major facilities, write computer code, and analyze complex sets of data. Because of the scientific and industrial relevance of condensed-matter physics, and the rapid growth of ultrafast technology, the students and post-doc become prepared for a wide variety of scientific and technical careers. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The newly discovered Dirac and Weyl semimetals have linearly-dispersing electronic bands, which cross at a node, but this node may sometimes be gapped. The ability to open and close a gap on sub-picosecond timescales could, if achieved, provide an ultrafast on-off switch for many of the materials' exotic optical effects; it could allow researchers to create Dirac fermions on demand and to explore and tune electronic states beyond those available in static materials. In one gapped Dirac material, SrMnSb2, electronic-structure calculations have identified a particular phonon mode which, if excited to sufficiently high amplitude, would shift the atoms' positions enough to close the gap, briefly and periodically, as the phonon oscillates. The purpose of this project is to optically excite the phonon, coherently and to high amplitude, and to observe the subsequent dynamics, thereby enabling sub-picosecond optical control of the gap of this Dirac semimetal and elucidating the physics that governs the gap's closing. The research consists of several optical experiments, each exciting the coherent phonon and then probing its effect with ultrafast resolution. Transient-grating spectroscopy explores the use of multiple laser pulses to control and amplify the phonon. Ultrafast X-ray diffraction measures the time-dependent, absolute displacement of atoms from equilibrium during the phonon's oscillation. Finally, optical-pump, mid-infrared-probe spectroscopy measures the resulting oscillation of the nodal gap, possibly showing the gap's closure at high oscillation amplitude. Together, these measurements can establish the quantitative relations between atomic position, nodal gap, and the pulses that drive the oscillation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics, as we all know, some objects, constructions, or proofs are more complicated than others. Logicians have developed various ways of measuring this complexity. When one is interested in countable objects, which are central to a wide range of mathematics, the tools to measure these complexities come from computability theory. The objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and structural issues to improve understanding of what forms complexity can take. The investigator will also continue work on a book series that aims to make it easier for the logic community to learn about the subject of computable structure theory, to help graduate students reach a research-level understanding of the subject, and to provide researchers with a modern reference.<br/><br/>The main component of this project is the study of the structure that emerges when considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. The project will study generalizations of the uniform Martin's conjecture and the almost-everywhere structure of Turing equivalence. The study of on-a-cone properties led to structural characterizations for a variety of notions from computable structure theory over the last decade. This project investigates the one-a-cone structure of the Turing degrees, of Turing equivalence, and of other recursion theoretic objects. The research will pursue two lines of inquiry. On the one hand, recent work suggests Martin's conjecture is just the tip of the iceberg, and that there are other situations where one can get a nice structural classification of relativizable objects. This research will search further for such structural classifications for equivalence relations other than Turing equivalence. On the other hand, conjectures about properties of the Turing equivalence and its interactions with its sub-equivalence relations may provide information on where Turing equivalence is located in the landscape of Borel equivalence relations, and the project will investigate this possibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research focuses on some longstanding open questions and conjectures, as well as several related problems. The work will lead to the development of new mathematical tools and techniques and push the limits of known methods. Moreover, through her teaching and mentoring, the investigator strives to encourage students to learn about mathematics and to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The questions studied in this project fall into two rough topic areas. The first of these areas is centered around the slice rank polynomial method that was introduced in 2016. This method has led to several spectacular results in additive combinatorics, but many related questions remain open. The investigator intends to study specific problems exemplifying the current limitations of the slice rank polynomial method. One aim of this project is to find ways to make the method more flexible and more widely applicable. The second topic area of the project concerns the inducibility problem, which was posed over forty years ago and is still wide open. Given a fixed graph H, and a large integer n, this problem asks about the maximum number of induced copies of H that an n-vertex graph can contain. A major open question in this area is the case where the graph H is a path or a cycle.

This project will help to fund the Global Supernova Project, which pools discoveries from every major local universe supernova search program, screens hundreds of potential candidates, and triggers prompt and long-term monitoring of the most interesting targets across the electromagnetic spectrum.  The research project will also foster education by giving students in the LCO schools program opportunities to observe SNe with the network, obtain real science data, and learn from provided curricula. The investigators will engage in public outreach including public talks, radio, TV, print, and YouTube appearances and interviews.  Finally, supporting a successful public-private partnership through the LCO should encourage more private funding of astronomy.<br/><br/><br/>The observing program has an aim of answering the following questions. (1) What are Fast Rising Luminous Transients?  Proposed answers range from the shock breakout of a supernova, a failed blue supergiant supernova, an electron capture supernova, fallback onto a shrouded central engine with jets, the merger of white dwarfs to become a magnetar, and the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate mass black hole.

Given the ever-increasing global demand, access to clean water is a world-wide problem that requires novel technologies to keep up with demand at reduced costs.  Since the ocean remains the only truly inexhaustible water source, reverse osmosis seawater desalination will remain a vital component of a sustainable water solution in the US and beyond.  Moreover, in places with scarce freshwater resources, such as Israel, Middle East, or Western US, desalination becomes a critical component. While desalination solutions have been on the market for more than 50 years, most of commercial reverse osmosis desalination installations still rely on decades-old membrane technology that has likely reached its useful limit years ago. In this joint US/Israel project, the investigators will develop a new kind of membrane that efficiently and quickly removes salt from water by passing water molecules through very small carbon nanotubes with diameters less than one-millionth of a human hair.  Nanotubes are not only small, but also extraordinarily efficient, passing water faster than any other known pore.  The propose studies also will take a radically-different approach that imitates the structure of the best membrane biological membrane 'the outer membrane of a live cell' and should deliver significant improvements over existing cell membranes for water purification. A vital part of this investigation will involve educational outreach to undergraduate and K-12 students on the importance of water technologies, training US and Israeli graduate students in the state of the art biomimetic technologies, and developing a joint US-Israel summer school in which the students can learn from global leaders in water purification research.<br/><br/>Technical: <br/>This collaborative project, which brings together two US-based biomaterials/nanopores groups (Noy, Wanunu) and an Israeli membrane science group (Freger), will develop a robust biomimetic membrane platform that mimics hierarchical organization of a cell membrane and exploits highly-efficient and selective transport in carbon nanotube porins. Specifically, membranes that comprise carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs) embedded in a thin matrix layer resting on a permeable membrane support will be designed and fabricated. These components mimic the three main structural elements of a cell membrane: (i) membrane pore channels, (ii) lipid bilayer, and (iii) cytoskeleton. This study will characterize water and ion transport in these membranes on ensemble and single-pore scales, focusing mainly on the physical principles by which nanopore confinement enables efficient and selective transport. This research will also use chemical modification to alter selectivity of the carbon nanotube porins. These membranes should enable enhanced membrane performance for reverse osmosis (RO) water purification and osmotic power generation using reverse electrodialysis (RED). They will also allow us to explore fundamental questions in modern membrane science, such as the physics of water transport and ion exclusion, the role of confinement in nanopores, effects of fixed charges, and limitations imposed by concentration polarization. Finally, outreach efforts in this project will allow us to highlight the importance of basic research and disruptive technological advances for ensuring future availability of clean water. This will be achieved through a) creation of a joint US-Israel summer school that would be focused on new water technologies and fundamentals of water-related science, b) training US graduate and undergraduate students about water research in the global context."

Stretchable conducting polymers, a special type of plastic that conducts electricity and deforms with body movement, have become a main class of materials for such applications. However, these polymers break more easily when deformed at a faster rate because of their intrinsic mechanical properties.  This is detrimental for electronics to be applied directly on human bodies since they are constantly undergoing dynamic movement. This CAREER project aims to develop a new class of adaptive stretchable conducting polymers with toughness that will scale with the rate of deformation. Specifically, the PI will explore and elucidate the fundamental chemical design principles for realizing and manipulating these adaptive mechanical properties. Successful execution of this project will lead to plastic electronics with enhanced stability, reliability, and practicality for next-generation wearable or on-skin electronics. These properties could also result in longer use cycles, and therefore reducing plastic waste and contributing to preservation of our environment. <br/><br/>The educational objective of this project is to increase the scientific literacy in Central California, a historically underserved region, and create a more diversified future STEM workforce. Specifically, the PI will develop low-cost 3D printing tools for local K-12 students to experimenting with various classes of polymers and learn the diversity, pervasiveness, and important role that polymers play in our lives. Modified versions of these experiments will be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum at UC Merced, a Hispanic Serving Institution, to expose undergraduate students to new soft materials and educate them at the forefront of polymer science. The PI also plans to publish these outreach experiments in an education journal, with the hope of disseminating this low-cost technology to increase scientific literacy and knowledge of polymers across the globe.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/><br/>A key challenge in realizing practical wearable and on-skin electronics using conducting polymers is to overcome their viscoelasticity. This strain rate-dependent property is highly detrimental as wearable and on-skin electronics made using these polymers would be prone to damage when used under conditions involving sudden movements and impact, such as during sports. This CAREER project aims to develop a set of chemical design principles for creating a new class of stretchable conducting polymers that defy this classic, unfavorable strain rate behavior. This objective will be realized by creating two competing deformation mechanisms at the molecular chain and nanoscopic domain levels. In phase I of the project, the PI will design and synthesize a number of conducting polymers with chemical structures that favor the formation of interpenetrated micelles. Different secondary interactions will be incorporated at the surface and interior of the micelles to serve as functional handles for tuning the two competing deformation mechanisms. Phase II of the project will employ a full suite of chemical, mechanical, electrical and structural characterization techniques to study these polymers. In particular, in-situ resistance/tensile/small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering will be used to decipher the structure-property relationships and deformation mechanisms at the surface and interior of the micelles across various length scales. Phase III of the project is aimed at optimizing the electrical conductivity of these impact-adaptive conducting polymers by creating effective charge transport pathways on the surface of the micelles. The polymer design principles and mechanistic insights gained through this project will lead to a body of fundamental knowledge for creating polymeric conductors that have toughness adaptive towards the degree of impact.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over time, the heavy element content builds up in a galaxy, increasing the metallicity of the gas.  Metallicity has an important role in governing how galaxies form new stars. Metallicity can also change because of inflow of gas from the galaxy's surroundings and outflows of gas from the galaxy disk caused by intense bursts of star formation. Once it is in a galaxy, gas with varying metallicity is mixed together by turbulence and flows.  The local metallicity in a galaxy therefore reflects the competition between all of these factors.  These investigators will study the region-to-region variation of metallicity in nearby galaxies to learn about how these important processes shape the heavy element content of galaxies.  The PI will also lead a program of professional development and mentoring for incoming transfer students to the physical sciences at UC San Diego with the goal of increasing their participation in undergraduate research.  <br/><br/>The investigators will make the next critical step forward in measuring ISM metallicities in nearby galaxies using new integral field spectroscopic observations performed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (VLT-MUSE). These instruments will obtain high sensitivity, fully-sampled maps of the 3500-9300 Angstrom optical spectrum allowing detailed metallicity studies using temperature-sensitive auroral emission lines of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Previous studies have been limited in their assessment of metallicity due the faintness of the spectral lines needed for accurate metallicity diagnostics. The investigators will use the KCWI and MUSE observations to study metallicity inhomogeneity as a function of galaxy properties such as morphology, specific star formation rate and presence of a stellar bar and they will compare these observations to predictions from galaxy simulations and theory. To broaden participation in science, the PI will lead a series of workshops for transfer students in the physical sciences at UC San Diego to provide training in research skills and guidance in finding research positions. The PI will also initiate organized data collection to track the career path of transfer students. This dataset will be used to assess the effectiveness of the program and develop further strategies for increasing the fraction of underrepresented minorities who pursue advanced degrees in the physical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In solids, currents--like those generated in a photovoltaic cell after illumination by sunlight--are usually carried by entities called ""quasi-particles."" When acted on by a force, quasi-particles behave like particles, but actually involve the co-ordinated motions of thousands to millions of atoms.   If an atom in a solid were scaled up to be the size of a person, then a quasi-particle would look something like ""the wave"" in a large, full stadium.  The PI's group has recently discovered a method to accelerate and collide quasi-particles about 1 trillion times per second (1 Terahertz).  The experimental signature of quasi-particle collisions is a rainbow-like spectrum of light that contains dozens of frequencies, or sidebands, that are equally spaced like the teeth on a comb.  Each sideband, carries information about the speed with which the quasiparticles have collided, and the quantum-mechanical properties of the solid through which they have been accelerated before colliding.  In this project, the PI's group will carefully analyze both the intensities and polarizations of the sidebands from a variety of electronic materials in order to elucidate the laws that govern the motion of quasiparticles and to search for new phases of strongly-driven matter.   Possible applications of the proposed research include faster and more energy efficient optical communications and internet, improved optical clocks that are necessary in the global positioning system, and the ability to rapidly and reversibly tune the properties of materials. This project will support the training of two Ph. D. students and several undergraduates, who will learn a variety of skills that are critical to preserving U. S. competitiveness in the high-technology sector.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project addresses one of the grand challenges of 21st century science--how does quantum matter behave when it is driven very far from thermal equilibrium. The goals of this project are to take advantage of new opportunities in the study of strongly-driven matter to (1) develop a method of measuring the Berry curvature of bands in solids, which is critical to understanding the dynamics of quasiparticles;   (2)  elucidate the nature of quasiparticles in materials in which correlations between electrons are strong, like the parent compounds of high-Tc superconductors; and (3) search for new quantum-mechanical phases near the edges of materials that are driven by strong, time-periodic fields.   In order to reach these goals, this project will use the recent discovery of high-order sideband generation (HSG) by the PI's group.  Each of the materials of interest will be illuminated by a NIR laser while it is being driven by a strong THz-frequency electric field, and the intensities and polarizations of the resulting HSG spectra will be analyzed.  Experiments will be closely coupled with theory to reach the project goals."
