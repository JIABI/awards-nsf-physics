There have been remarkable advances in the way statistical models are defined from data for prediction or for accurate descriptions of the world we observe. While complex predictive models have routinely emerged, our understanding of these models and methods for their evaluation have been lagging. Appropriate tools for assessing models and recognizing their deficiencies, and proper ways to account for their complexity are in great need. To fill these gaps, the project aims to develop methodologies and computational tools for assessment of case influence on general models in predictive settings. And it will extend the notion of model complexity to general prediction rules for model comparison and calibration by using the overall model sensitivity to data perturbation. Results from this research will bring great benefit not only to science and engineering through the practice of refined statistical modeling, but also to society at large through applications. In particular, the project will have practical utility in outlier detection for many scientific applications, fraud/threat detection and prevention for many business applications, and detection of adversarial attacks for artificial intelligence applications. Moreover, it will advance our understanding of modern algorithmic models such as deep learning through the research on model complexity and foster interdisciplinary research. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. Computational tools developed will be distributed as open-source software.<br/><br/>To characterize the sensitivity of a predictive model to data, the PIs will develop novel approaches to case influence assessment for general modeling procedures, encompassing many modern statistical learning techniques for classification and regression. Extending case deletion statistics and case influence graph in linear regression, the project will offer a variety of new case influence measures for classification in particular. In addition, the PIs will develop efficient computational algorithms for evaluating those case influence measures by utilizing a homotopy technique to relate two modeling problems with the original data and perturbed data under various perturbation schemes. Further, the project will examine model complexity through the lens of model sensitivity to data perturbation considered in case influence assessment and extend the notion of model degrees of freedom to general modeling procedures including large-margin classifiers. This extension will be based on the relation between expected optimism and model complexity in the risk estimation framework where model sensitivities to perturbation of individual cases can be linked to the conditional expected optimism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of the most exciting advancements in our understanding of the universe can come from joint observations of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals, as was evident from the detection of merging neutron stars in August of 2017 by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations as well as electromagnetic telescopes around the world.  This project will enable prompt follow-up of detected gravitational-wave signals with electromagnetic telescopes by increasing the speed and accuracy with which gravitational-wave data from the LIGO detectors can be calibrated and disseminated to astrophysical analyses.  In addition to enabling the advancements in science that will be obtained from prompt multi-messenger astronomy, this project will also shepherd the next generation of scientists into this exciting field.  The project funds the development and expansion of a Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group that serves as a no-barrier-to-entry research opportunity for high school and early-career undergraduate students at Kenyon College and in the surrounding community.  This group has already launched several undergraduates into LIGO-related research projects, and this project will allow that pipeline to expand and improve access to a wide range of students.<br/><br/>The first step in gravitational-wave data analysis is the accurate and prompt reconstruction, or calibration, of the detector strain h(t). Currently the calibrated strain data is available to quick-response gravitational-wave searches in approximately 10 seconds with minimal information about the quality of the detector data. This project will propel LIGO data production into the future with very low-latency calibrated strain data, subtraction of noise in the calibrated strain data, and robust information about the quality of the strain data. This transformed data product would then be at the fingertips of quick-response gravitational-wave searches, thereby improving the ability of these searches to both find and quantify gravitational waves in the data.  The project incorporates undergraduates and high school students into this cutting-edge field.  Undergraduate students will be involved in implementing low-latency methods for removing noise from the strain data and using machine learning algorithms to provide predictions about the probability of loud, transient noise events being present in the data.  High school students and early undergraduate students will be initiated into the fields of astronomy and gravitational-wave physics through the Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group at Kenyon College.  ROAR students will perform astronomy observations and pulsar candidate identification that will contribute to the field of pulsar timing.  This program thereby establishes a research pipeline through which students can engage early in research opportunities and transition into advanced research areas.  The ROAR program brings scientific research and education opportunities to high school students in a rural area who would otherwise have little exposure to modern scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is nowadays often expressed in a form of multimedia, involving videos accompanied with images, captions, and audio. Given the explosive growth of such multimedia data, it is extremely critical that it is accurately summarized and organized for automatic processing in artificial intelligence. One important yet challenging problem is automatic interpretation and summarization of video content, having enormous applications in video advertisements, online video searching and browsing, movie recommendation based on personal preference, and essentially any electronic commerce platform. In this project, the research team plans to develop statistical tools to raise our capacity of processing digital information to respond to a rapid growth of video content in real-world applications. The primary objective is to create a learning system to decipher the meaning of visual expressions as perceived by the audience, with a focus on understanding semantic meaning conveyed by a video.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop methods of automatic video interpretation and description, which understands visual thoughts expressed by a video and generates semantic expressions of the content of a video. Particularly, it will utilize conditional dependence structures of entities as well as between entities and their pertinent actions, in a framework of multi-label and hierarchical classification. It will focus on three areas: 1) entity and action learning, 2) semantic learning for long videos and content-based segmentation, and 3) automatic video description generation, each of which develops techniques in novel ways. In each area, classification will be performed collaboratively based on pairwise conditional label dependencies and temporal dependencies of video frames, characterized by graphical and hidden Markov models. Special effort will be devoted to learning from multiple sources and extracting latent structures corresponding to scenes of a video. The PIs also plan to release the software developed as open source and build a user community around the language by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the codebase of the software developed. This will allow a wider growth of the  project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award."

The project is focused on investigating the structure and dynamics of polymer catenanes. Mechanically-interlocked macromolecules (MIMs) such as DNA and protein catenanes are macromolecular assemblies that can be thought of as being held together by a kind of ""mechanical bond"" formed from interlocking rings rather than usual direct chemical bonds. This novel structure is expected to exhibit unique properties, particularly in comparison with those of linear chain-like molecules, classic polymers. Limitations in synthesis approaches have delayed research on MIMs. Since the 1950's improved synthesis methods were sought to substantially increase the yield of MIMs. Recent advances in synthetic methods, particularly ""template-directed"" synthesis, have substantially improved yields for MIMs and led to the 2016 Nobel prize in Chemistry. This opens research into understanding the unique physical properties of MIMs, as well as their applications.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will use computer simulation in tandem with machine learning (ML) to explore catenated polymers and investigate their structure and dynamics in different physical environments.

Mechanically-interlocked macromolecules (MIMs) such as catenanes are macromolecular assemblies held together by topological constraints rather than chemical bonds, possess well-defined topological interactions, and are expected to exhibit a variety of unique properties that are much different than their linear counterparts. Limitations in synthesis approaches has led to slow progress in this area, until the recent development of new synthetic methods, ""template-directed"" synthesis, which substantially improved yields for MIMs. <br/><br/>This project involves the use of all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in tandem with machine learning (ML) to investigate the structure and dynamics of catenanes, including at surfaces and interfaces.

Causal inference has become one of three main tasks in data science, in addition to descriptive and predictive analyses.  This research project aims to close existing gaps in estimation of heterogeneous causal effects and will make more statistical tools available for analyzing massive observational data.  It will blend the conventional statistical approaches to causal inference with the fast-growing machine learning techniques and provide researchers and policy makers with powerful methodological tools to better evaluate the impact of interventions and thus to optimize decision making.  Doctoral students in Statistics and Biostatistics will be involved in the development and implementation of the methods.<br/><br/>This project concerns the development of a stream of innovative Bayesian semiparametric methods for efficient and robust causal inference in the presence of effect heterogeneity in large observational datasets.  Conventional statistical approaches have a strong tie to randomized experiments, which enjoy easy causal interpretation but may suffer in terms of efficiency.  Moreover, recently developed nonparametric regression and machine learning methods focus primarily on outcome modelling and prediction, which may encounter troubles from confounding and are often more difficult to interpret.  Furthermore, hidden bias from unmeasured confounding is a major concern in observational studies.  The status quo sensitivity analysis for assessing hidden bias does not accommodate complex data structures.  The PIs will develop a robust Bayesian semiparametric framework for incorporating the treatment assignment process into the outcome modelling.  The framework can easily accommodate complex heterogenous effects or hierarchical structures in massive observational data, adequately take advantage of experts? knowledge and existing causal theory on how the intervention might work, and effectively assess the impact due to potential unmeasured confounders.  Propensity scores will be incorporated in potential outcome models via Gaussian process priors and connections with the conventional matching estimators will be established.  Moreover, the impact of unmeasured confounding will be assessed through Bayesian sensitivity analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example in marketing, the statistician may be interested in learning the purchasing behavior of consumers from an analysis of a database of consumer transactions that includes various consumer descriptors (e.g. age, income level, geographic location) as well as  purchase amounts. The statistician would then typically attempt to build a mathematical model that characterizes the relationship between the consumer descriptors and the expenditure amount.  In doing so, however, certain issues bear strongly on the model's value and effectiveness.  First, the validity of a model may strongly depend on prior assumptions about the nature of the modeled process, information that can be difficult to ascertain. For instance, a consumer behavior model which builds in a simple assumption that consumers with higher income levels are always expected to purchase more, may be inadvertently ignoring subtleties that violate this assumption when other factors are simultaneously taken into account.  Second, sometimes even a valid and effective model may be such a complicated object that the extraction of meaningful information can itself be very challenging.  For example, after establishing particular set of predictors as important drivers of consumer purchasing power, it will still be of key interest how to best measure their relative importance in the model.  Focusing on the powerful and flexible approach of Bayesian regression tree ensemble modeling, the main thrust of this project will be to innovate this methodology to address these and other modeling avenues.  This new methodology will enable practitioners to address their research questions in an assumption-lean framework that allows the ensemble models to make use of their data to adaptively and flexibly incorporate contextual modeling assumptions. To greatly enhance interpretability, it will also provide automatic, information based summaries of variable importance to help the practitioner understand and interpret the available descriptor information.  In addition to these and further methodological contributions, the project will develop software for the implementation of this methodology as a freely available R package, enabling practitioners to more easily leverage our developments in their practical work. This is where the graduate student supported by this award will help. <br/><br/><br/>The research will focus on three general innovations to Bayesian ensemble modeling to further enhance its ability to extract meaning from complex data within an assumption lean framework.    The first contribution will develop theoretically valid measures of variable importance.  These measures will provide computationally efficient calculation of indices which meaningfully gauge the relative importance of predictor variables, both marginally and in terms of interactions.  The second contribution will provide an approach to monotone shape constrained inference which does not require any prior assumption of monotonicity.  This multidimensional nonparametric regression approach will enable the discovery and estimation of any and all the monotone components of the regression function, and to do so with no constraint assumptions whatsoever.  The third contribution will vastly extend the applicability of Bayesian ensemble modeling by developing a generalization of BART for arbitrary response data distributions, such as dichotomous responses and count data.  This major technical innovation will be based on a conjugacy-free formulation that will extend the reach of BART to many new application areas and problem types than were previously possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stochastic topology provides a well-posed null hypothesis and for the emerging area of topological data analysis. Topological statistical mechanics endeavors to find topological underpinnings of different phases of matter.

It is an open-ended question whether these random hypertrees have a scaling limit; such a limit which would be higher-dimensional analogue of Aldous's continuum random tree. The PI will also investigate complicated configuration spaces, such as configuration spaces of hard disks or squares. These are interesting from the point  of view of physics, since they represent the energy landscape for a hard-spheres system.

Only two biological systems are capable of exploiting light as a source of energy: chlorophyll systems and rhodopsins. Chlorophyll systems are complex, composed of dozens of protein and pigment molecules. Rhodopsins, on the other hand, consist of one protein and one retinal molecule assembled in a simple architecture. In spite of such simplicity, rhodopsins carry out a variety of important light-powered functions such as ion-pumping, ion-channeling and color-sensing in microorganisms, and vision in invertebrates and vertebrates. These photoswitchable properties are of enormous interest in tailoring proteins for use as specialized probes, actuators, and switches. This research uses a sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena as a reference system. Professor Olivucci's ARM (Automatic Rhodopsin Model) protocol is used to construct a large number of computationally ""mutated"" rhodopsins, involving an artificial amino acid substitution in the protein sequence. ARM is used to simulate the mutated protein using a combination of classical and advanced quantum mechanical techniques, and predict the relationship between the changes in protein sequence and specific responses to light. Large numbers of mutated rhodopsins can be computationally generated and simulated in parallel, enormously extending the range and diversity of variants that can be explored. This project will extend ARM to predict a range of new properties, with the goal of developing a systematic theory of rhodopsin light sensitivity for application to fluorescence microscopy, molecular evolution, and optogenetics. ARM is being implemented by BGSU students as an online web-based server to facilitate open student and researcher access to the protocol. This will allow high school students and undergraduates to generate and explore sophisticated, atomic-scale rhodopsin models without requiring significant theoretical background. Professor Olivucci is integrating ARM into the BGSU graduate program in photochemical science, to provide a novel introduction to structural and functional photobiology using molecular visualization techniques complemented by 3D printing capabilities.  <br/><br/>This aim of this project is to understand how proteins control elementary photochemical reactions by developing a novel computational technology. Building on Professor Olivucci's ARM protocol for the fast and automated construction of QM/MM models of light-responsive proteins, a more accurate, second-generation version will be developed featuring free energy calculation capabilities and an expanded benchmark set. The goal is to learn how to reprogram protein spectroscopy and thermochemical and photochemical reactivity by tailoring the chemical properties of a protein reference system---in this project, a sensory rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena. The construction and analysis of sets of mutated models and their experimental verification are expected to reveal novel engineering principles. More specifically, and together with external collaborators, Professor Olivucci is learning how mutations may control the excited state isomerization dynamics and lifetime of the system and, among other applications, to use this knowledge to design, and express in the laboratory, fluorescent rhodopsins that could be employed as sensors in optogenetics. Specific aims of the research include computationally screening large numbers of Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) mutants, searching for ASR mutants exhibiting longer excited state lifetimes, and improving the accuracy, applicability and automation of ARM to a level suitable for dissemination and broad use by the scientific community."

Gene therapy, the therapeutic delivery of nucleic acid into a patient's cells as a drug to treat disease, has the potential to be a general treatment for any disease with a genetic determinant. However, protection of genetic cargo from degradation and clearance, as well as delivery to the correct tissue location is a significant challenge. Two major approaches will be applied to produce these new biomaterials: 1) combination of natural components with an artificial scaffold; and 2) modification of natural biomaterial scaffolds with synthetic components. The artificial components are designed to bind gene therapeutics, while the natural components impart targeting function and biocompatibility. The artificial biomaterials will thus mask the presence of the therapeutic cargo, protecting it from degradation. Natural biological components such as sugars and lipids are expected to enhance water-solubility, biocompatibility and targeting of gene therapy to the correct biological target. These new biomaterials will be tested for their abilities to mimic natural packaging and protection strategies. This research could lead to the development of more efficient therapeutic products through a potentially general method and thus accelerate the emergence of new therapies based on bioinspired biomaterial carriers. Given the importance of molecular therapies for biomedical problems, these new biomaterials could have a significant impact on human health.  <br/><br/>  <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This proposal uses a simple synthetic motif to generate a new family of nucleic acid reactive biomaterials from readily available native ligands and polymers. This novel approach uses triazine derivatization to unify nucleic acid binding with cell-surface targeting in a multifunctional carrier design. It is the goal of this proposal to develop a general synthetic approach to transform synthetic and native biomaterials into nucleic acid carrier platforms, and elucidate the structural basis of functional intracellular delivery. This creative and original approach will yield the following expected outcomes: 1) A facile synthetic method to generate novel non-electrostatic nucleic acid binders from synthetic and biomolecular backbones; 2) a general method to transform native ligands into nucleic acid carriers; and 3) a method to target native T/U-rich nucleic acids. This research will impact targeted delivery of both RNA and DNA and enable intracellular targeting of native nucleic acid components with carriers in which binding can be decoupled from electrostatics.

Scott Hartley from Miami University to develop molecules that replicate and ultimately complement the remarkable capabilities of naturally occurring macromolecules.  For a very long time, synthetic chemists have struggled to prepare molecules of comparable size and complexity to proteins and nucleic acids.  It takes the human body anywhere between 20 seconds to a couple of minutes to make a protein.  In contrast, preparing and assembling hundreds of amino acids into a long chain of the same protein would take a chemist days to months, if it is even possible at all. Further, designing new structurally-complex systems based on biochemical building blocks is extremely challenging.  This project avoids tedious synthetic paths by taking advantage of the assembly of smaller and more-easily prepared molecules. The results from this award are expected to provide fundamental answers about the nature, dynamics and interactions between structurally complex molecules, which are of relevance to developing artificial systems with similar capabilities to large biological molecules.  While the target compounds are not necessarily chemically equivalent to biomacromolecules, their behavior in relevant processes such as folding and recognition is similar.  The broader impacts of this work include the development of laboratory modules for introductory organic chemistry courses, undergraduate involvement in research, and participation in a consortium of Ohio universities aimed at supporting underrepresented minority students in the STEM fields.<br/><br/>This work is focused on the investigation of the dynamic control and self-assembly of ortho-phenylene foldamers.  In developing these foldamers, the capabilities of biomacromolecules, such as molecular recognition, catalysis, and responsive behavior (molecular ""machinery""), can potentially be replicated, providing access to complex processes through simple and non-tedious molecular design.  Several studies are carried out in order to achieve this goal, involving the development of fluorinated o-phenylenes, controlling dynamic systems with switchable twist and long-range conformational communication, and structure-property effects for the assembly of twisted macrocycles.  The use of fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is particularly interesting because this technique is simple and yet offers an impactful method for elucidating the folding behavior of these ortho-phenylene systems.  Conceptually, this work is expected to provide fundamental answers in the context of the foldamer field, conformational dynamics, and the synthesis of complex structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algae are microscopic organisms that drift in the water columns of lakes and oceans. They form the foundation of the aquatic food web and produce approximately 50% to 85% of the world's oxygen via photosynthesis. Their population persistence is critical to ecosystem health. However, harmful algal blooms are a serious problem in some bodies of water, including Lake Erie. Blooms can be caused by the reversal of the competition between toxin-producing algae and the non-toxic diatoms. In well-mixed environments, cyanobacteria are competitively excluded by diatoms, but in poorly mixed or stratified water the toxic cyanobacteria float upwards to form surface scum and exclude diatoms. Hydrologic measures, such as altering the turbulent mixing in lakes, can solve the problem under appropriate conditions. This project will use mathematical models to understand the competition among phytoplankton and help design more effective hydrologic control strategies. Innovative mathematical analysis will be performed to quantify the effect of various environmental processes in shaping the population dynamics of phytoplankton. This project will provide research topics for PhD students and undergraduate summer projects. The undergraduate mentorship will be leveraged with the Summer Undergraduate Capstone Conference of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at Ohio State University. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand the effect of environmental drivers, including spatial heterogeneity, non-uniform mixing, and light and nutrient availability, in shaping the community structure of a diverse phytoplankton population. We will develop phytoplankton population models of a single species, multiple species, and a continuous spectrum of species to address four key biological questions: (1) In eutrophic conditions nutrients are abundant, but light is limited. How does water column stratification affect the persistence of a single species? (2) Human activities have accelerated the eutrophication of many freshwater lakes and coastal ecosystems, causing harmful algal blooms to emerge. Can artificial mixing create a competitive reversal, allowing non-toxic diatoms to competitively exclude the toxic algae? (3) Phytoplankton communities are diverse and can be structured along various functional trade-offs. How do trade-offs in light acquisition affect  coexistence among phytoplankton species? (4) How do nutrient dynamics influence phytoplankton competition in spatially heterogeneous environments? For two-species competing in stratified water columns, long-term dynamics will be classified by monotone dynamical systems results. A significant methodological advance of this project is the game-theoretical approach of using mutation-selection models. This approach captures the surprising diversity of the phytoplankton by grouping various phytoplankton species according to their functional traits.  Finally, the effect of nutrient dynamics will be addressed in a thin-layer limit, with emphasis on the evolutionary stability of deep chlorophyll maxima.

This conference represents the Annual International Meeting of the Association of Quantum Probability and Infinite Dimensional Analysis (AQPIDA). It will be the first Quantum Probability Meeting organized in the United States. AQPIDA was established with the intention of promoting the area of Quantum Probability, a mathematical field started by the efforts of John von Neumann, almost simultaneously as Classic Probability was founded by Andrey Kolmogorov. The development of Classic Probability was very fast, but the progress in Quantum Probability was much slower. In the last two decades, great advancement was made in Quantum Probability, specially by mathematicians from Italy, Japan, Korea, and Poland. Our main objective, for organizing this meeting in the United States, is to promote Quantum  Probability among the American mathematicians and scientists. This conference will also give the opportunity to mathematicians working in Classic and Quantum Probability to come together, discuss problems that are of common interest for both groups of people, and eliminate the artificial barriers that separate the two fields. Among the invited people, there are also several physicists, and this will contribute to the refreshing of the traditional collaboration that existed in the past among mathematicians and physicists. <br/><br/>Strict mathematical objectives  include: codifying properties of probability measures, having finite moments of all orders, in terms of their quantum operators: creation, annihilation, and preservation operators, understanding how the commutation relationships that exist among the quantum operators can lead to new physical interpretations about interacting systems, making progress in understanding the quantum Markov chains or fields, understanding how the commutation relationships among the quantum operators affect the kernels of second quantization operators and Wick products, using the kernels to prove sharp inequalities about the norms of Wick products and hypercontractivity inequalities involving the second quantization operators, making progress in understanding the connections of instantons with the ``exotic Laplacians"" (higher order Levy Laplacians), making progress in the development of the theory of quantum Markov semi-groups and of their generators, making progress in the study of quantum networks, and making progress toward building a reliable quantum computer. <br/><br/>The web-site of the conference is the following: https://osumarion.osu.edu/events/icqp.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex disordered solids are non-crystalline materials for which the fundamental building blocks are typically molecules or molecule fragments, and therefore they have great potential for tunable structure and properties for various applications of great scientific and technological importance. The key feature of our novel approach is to develop an efficient iterative loop that involves simulating the atomic structure of complex disordered solids, subsequently characterizing the resultant structures/properties, and sending the information back to fabrication conditions for further optimization. This new development is significant because it will demonstrate a computation-based design principle for systematically obtaining the growth parameters needed to make complex disordered materials with targeted properties. Ultimately, that ability can be directed to produce materials that are optimized for particular applications. It is envisioned that the results of this project will be transferrable to a wide range of complex disordered material types, growth methods, and structural/functional properties. The complete system is designated as the amorphous materials designer (AMD) program. During the construction of the AMD, students from high school up though Ph.D. graduate school will be trained by the investigators in all aspects of the research including materials simulation, fabrication, and characterization using advanced state-of-the-art methods.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The research will focus on developing an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) simulation algorithm, augmented by ab initio based energy constraints, that couples with experimental input and feedback, using a series of thin-film amorphous preceramic polymers (a-BC:H, a-SiBCN:H, and a-SiCO:H) as suitably complex and technologically relevant case studies. The unique utility of modern solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to obtain specific bonding and connectivity information and the sensitive medium-range order information available from fluctuation electron microscopy - a specialized technique based on transmission electron microscopy - will be combined with neutron diffraction and more routine physical and electronic structure characterization methods to provide input and constraints for the simulations. The HRMC modeling efforts will be optimized via particle swarm optimization and subsequently used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) that will predictively link the parameters used to simulate a desired material with the growth parameters needed to fabricate said material. Consequently, the investigators expect to substantially advance the state of the art and surmount traditional challenges associated with (1) identifying non-global potential energy minima for materials produced under non-thermodynamic conditions and (2) aligning simulation and growth process timescales. This effort will benefit technology and society by advancing the science of design of complex disordered solids. The novelty of the effort lies in developing the algorithms and rule-sets that will tie together growth, characterization, and simulation, as well as in developing strategies for mapping (not necessarily reproducing) fabrication conditions and desired properties, and it is this that takes the effort from evolutionary to potentially revolutionary. The PIs also plan to release the AMD program as open source and build a user community around it by ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the AMD codebase. This will allow a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special interest to the software cluster in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, which has provided co-funding for this award."

These unusual physical phenomena include perfect lensing, negative refraction, and cloaking. According to Google Scholar, over 90,000 research papers, book chapters and books have been devoted to the science and applications of MM. Analysis and design of MM relies on their large-scale (""macroscopic"") parameters and on effective medium theories (""homogenization"") needed to obtain these parameters. The behavior of typical MM is nonlocal: that is, their response at a given point in space may depend on the excitation at a different point. Yet mathematical and numerical homogenization methods for nonlocal regimes are scarce and insufficient. This project will remove this critical impediment to further progress in MM. Existing homogenization theories, some of which date back to classical physics of the 19th century, will thereby be significantly extended. The broad technical impact will be in the field of MM, not necessarily electromagnetic. Nonlocal homogenization will allow us to establish unambiguously which applications of metamaterials are practically feasible and to optimize the performance of metamaterial devices. The broader impact will also be in the science of nonlocal media, for example nonlocal electrostatics of biomolecules in solvents, which has applications in protein modeling and drug discovery.<br/><br/>The chief objective of this research is to advance the analysis, simulation and applications of electromagnetic metamaterials by developing a nonlocal two-scale homogenization theory. This theory involves Trefftz approximations of the electromagnetic fields on both coarse and fine scales, and a judiciously chosen set of degrees of freedom. This is a substantial, and necessary, extension not only of traditional theories, but also of the non-asymptotic but local theory the PI has developed in recent years. For canonical examples such as layered media or photonic crystals, the PI will demonstrate a consistent order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement in the transmission/reflection coefficients. The intellectual merit of the this research is in the development of a new paradigm of nonlocal homogenization, of new computational methods related to it, and in the application of new methodology to electromagnetic metamaterials."

This topic is of broad importance since both the bulk properties of polymer containing materials and the functionality of biopolymers and many polymer-based ""smart"" materials are directly linked to the underlying microscopic conformation of individual polymer molecules.  Many smart or biologically active materials utilize polymer chains tethered to surfaces while biopolymers typically operate in very crowded macromolecular environments. In this geometrically constrained environment polymers can behave differently and a focus of this research is on the basic physics of polymer confinement with specific applications to materials design. This research continues and extends recent work by the PI with significant contributions from undergraduate collaborators in the areas of solvent effects on polymer conformation and phase transitions of isolated homopolymer chains.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are to:<br/><br/> (i) elucidate the effects of local environment on the conformational phase transitions of a single polymer chain as relevant, for example, to the design and function of polymer-based environmentally responsive smart materials;<br/><br/> (ii) study single-polymer phase transitions, in particular, polymer all-or-none ""folding"", which can provide an on/off switch in smart materials applications, in crowded or geometrically confined environments; and<br/><br/> (iii) develop rigorous analysis tools such as partition function zeros and free energy landscapes to study phase transitions and transition pathways in polymer systems. <br/><br/>This work will make use of both a solvation potential approach, recently developed by the PI to reduce computational complexity in modeling polymer-solvent systems, and advanced simulation techniques that allow for direct computation of the density of states of classical many-body systems.  The latter methods provide complete thermodynamic information and can be used to carry out subsequent multi-canonical simulations to determine structural information.  <br/>  <br/>This research contributes to the understanding of single-macromolecule behavior through the development of rigorous solvation potentials, density of states simulation methods, and new analysis techniques.  It will contribute to efforts to develop rational design principles for functional polymer-based and biomimetic materials.

Blocking or inhibiting this interaction could stop the invasion of the human cell by this highly infectious virus. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Dr. Xiaohong Tan at Bowling Green University in Bowling Green, Ohio to create DNA aptamers to inhibit this initial step of viral invasion. Aptamers are short sequences of DNA that fold into a shape that matches that of a target molecule, thereby keeping other molecules from binding. These DNA aptamers are ?designed? by successive selection of molecules from large mixtures of different sequences, resulting in a few sequences that keep all other DNAs from binding the target. Dr. Tan uses this selection process to find DNA aptamers that bind tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two of more of the identified DNA aptamers are linked together to create ?super binders? that are much better at inhibiting the interaction than would any single aptamer. Constructing DNA aptamers that block the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells may lead to the design of antiviral agents that help lessen the infectivity that causes the COVID-19 pandemic.  Educational and training activities will focus on postdoctoral researchers learning cutting edge techniques in chemical biology on a ?front line? research problem. The team is developing ways to communicate their science to the public, to K-12 institutions, and to other research groups using distance learning technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop polymeric molecules (fusion DNA aptamers) that significantly interact with the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The objective is to effectively block the virus from binding to the specific ACE2 receptor, thereby blocking the entry of the virus into human cells and, as a result, its ability to cause COVID-19 infections.  Professor Tan uses SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify individual aptamers that interact with three distinct regions on the cell binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The affinities of aptamers to their targets are measured through standard binding assays. These individual high affinity DNA aptamers are connected together using nucleic acid or chemical linkers to make fusion aptamers that have affinities comparable to those of antibodies. The ability of these fused DNA aptamer ?super binders? to effectively block this interaction is tested against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using standard technologies, as well as live SARS-CoV-2 through collaboration with the University of Toledo Medical School.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalytic chemicals can greatly enhance the reaction rates, which allows the reactions to proceed under milder and more controllable conditions, and improves the selectivity to the desired product (fewer by-products). Currently, developing a good catalyst for a specific, desirable reaction is challenging and requires good knowledge of how the reactants and catalyst interact. In this project, Dr. Zhenmeng Peng is researching the key factors that determine reactant-catalyst interactions for transition metals in carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalysis. Dr. Peng's approach is to improve upon an adsorption model for accurate calculation of these interactions from easy to perform measurements.  Knowledge gained in this research helps to significantly accelerate the search for new catalysts. Catalysis plays an essential role in chemical, petrochemical and energy industries, with catalytic materials being widely used for chemical conversions and energy generation, and thus the research has broad societal impact.  Dr. Peng is also actively engaged in a number of outreach activities, aimed at creating early scientific interest in high school students and influencing their career development in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.  He is involved in the development of a nanocatalysis learning module for K-12 teachers, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, development of a community learning network course, and diversity outreach efforts with Women in Engineering (WIE) and Increasing Diversity in Engineering Academics (IDEA) programs at the University of Akron.

To this aim, Dr. Peng is synthesizing model catalysts with a controlled d-band center and work function parameters and examining their correlations with CO and O2 adsorption.  The research employs Ead of the reacting species to obtain information on the reaction mechanism and other important catalytic properties which are challenging to measure experimentally. Establishing an exact Ead-catalyst parameter relationship allows Dr. Peng to characterize adsorbate and reactive intermediate bonding to the metal substrate, the knowledge of which helps to understand the catalytic mechanism, identify reactive intermediates, and guide catalyst research.

In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors L. Robert Baker and Aravind Asthagiri are using a combination of an experimental technique called sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy and computational modeling called density functional theory (DFT) to investigate carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by a series of copper and copper/iron containing photo-electrocatalysts.  SFG vibrational spectroscopy is able to show how molecules important in CO2 reduction interact with the catalyst surfaces during the reaction.  DFT calculations are used to help explain the SFG data generated during the reaction.  The combination  of the two techniques leads to a complete picture of the surface reaction mechanism, allowing for better design of the catalyst and the photo-electrocatalysis process.  The ability to photo-electrochemically reduce CO2 using sunlight has the potential to enable us to recycle carbon and stabilize the environmental impacts of CO2 emissions from automobiles and other sources.

In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors L. Robert Baker and Aravind Asthagiri are using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and complementary density functional theory (DFT) computational modeling to investigate CO2 activation and subsequent reduction on a series of CuO/CuFeO2 surfaces as a function of relative phase composition.  CuO/CuFeO2 catalysts with varying amounts of CuO and CuFeO2 show tunable selectivity between acetate and formate production.  The ability to probe the molecular intermediates associated with these reaction pathways, coupled with the ability to tune these relative rates, is providing a valuable case study for a thorough mechanistic investigation of the surface properties that mediate reaction kinetics leading to tunable selectivity for CO2 reduction.  Complementary measurements using femtosecond soft x-ray spectroscopy show electron thermalization kinetics and site-specific charge localization with element specificity.  Through information from the soft x-ray spectroscopy and DFT-derived band structure, the team obtains the reduction potential of site-localized photo-excited electrons in the oxide surface and compares these potentials to the calculated change in free energy of formation of elementary steps on these respective atomic sites.  This combination of approaches bridges the fields of semiconductor photo-physics with surface chemistry and catalysis in order to provide a fundamental framework for understanding the selectivity of CO2 photo-electrochemistry on metal oxides surfaces.

Professor Terry Bigioni and his research group at the University of Toledo are changing this limitation by systematically studying different types of nanoparticle reactions to learn the details of nanoparticle synthesis and transformation. By shedding light on how nanoparticles react, chemists may be able to make better nanomaterials and enable new technologies that drive the economy and help society. The fundamental nature of this work means that it can impact a broad range of fields, such as better catalysts that clean the air and conserve energy, new classes of anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs, light-emitting beacons for biomedical imaging, or energy absorbers for harvesting energy directly from the sun.

In this context, new reactions involving the use of abundantly available and sustainable feedstock starting materials such as ethylene, butadiene, isoprene, methyl acrylate, earth-abundant metals such as cobalt and nickel, and ligands that bind to those metals are being examined.  This research is solving two significant challenges in this area, namely, activation of stable molecules and their subsequent selective incorporation into other molecules. It is also providing outstanding opportunities for fundamental discoveries in chemistry.  The interdisciplinary nature of this research, which covers the areas of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, and employs the techniques from analytical, physical organic, and computational chemistry, also provides a useful platform for training undergraduate and graduate students.  The RajanBabu group is involved in outreach activities with Columbus public schools, the Ohio Science Olympiad, and the REEL (Research Experiences to Enhance Learning) program at OSU. The later is transforming the undergraduate laboratory experience by incorporating state of the art instrumentation and providing experience on the use of this instrumentation to solve challenging chemical problems.

A study of the reaction mechanism points to a new highly reactive low-valent cationic cobalt (I) species as a possible catalyst for this reaction.  Preliminary results suggest that there are other reactions that could be catalyzed by a similar species.

However the ability to form these materials into useful shapes at ambient temperature has been the Achilles heel to widespread implementation.

These properties rely on the ease of plastic deformation, a phenomenon that is mediated by atomic level processes. This research effort provides a fundamental understanding of how the atomic processes, responsible for enhanced formability, can be facilitated through addition of alloying elements. Furthermore, the integrated computational/experimental methodology developed by this program is a crucial step towards physics-based predictive alloy design compared to the traditional empirical approach based on trial and error and can be applied to a range of other metallic systems with similar crystal structure, such as technologically important Ti and Zr alloys. Moreover, the education and outreach component of this program, are aimed at (1) incorporating computational modeling in classroom to enhance learning of difficult concepts, (2) preparing materials science and engineering students for future careers with an increased importance of computational modeling and (3) fostering enthusiasm about Science, Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) fields in students, particularly from underrepresented groups.

Elements that promote the slip of edge segments without compromising the motion of screw segments will be suggested as viable candidates. The consequence of the theoretical alloying suggestions will be evaluated experimentally by (3) making single crystals of the proposed alloys (4) measuring stress-strain curves and (5) characterizing dislocation structure evolution.

Introducing ""dynamic bonds"" (i.e., chemical bonds that can be exchanged between different groups) into a polymeric material can lead to self-healing properties and enhanced stability in case of external damage to the material. However, this can also lead to permanent changes in shape when external forces are applied, which could limit utility in applications.

The structure of the underlying polymer will be tuned for this purpose and additional reinforcement will be enabled by incorporation of carbon nanotubes, which will improve mechanical properties and electrical conductivity.  This research is anticipated to produce materials with enhanced lifetime and reprocessability due to the healing properties enabled by dynamic bonding. This will enable the next generation of polymeric materials to have extended useful lifetime, with reduced replacement costs, improved performance against mechanical challenges, and enhanced conductivity. The material synthesis strategies developed in this research could be translated to additive manufacturing enabling a range of tailor-made materials with complex structures. <br/><br/>This project will also include outreach activities that place dynamically cross-linked polymers in the hands of K-12 students and develop continuing education activities for K-12 teachers. This project will also develop educational tools to promote critical thinking and involvement in classrooms to train the next generation of scientists and propel them to productive careers in science. Further, this project will engage students of diverse backgrounds in graduate and undergraduate research, to foster participation in STEM fields from populations that are traditionally underrepresented.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY    <br/><br/>This research will develop well-defined polymers containing dual-dynamic crosslinking, where both a non-covalent linker that exchanges rapidly and a dynamic covalent linker that exchanges under external stimulus are used in one polymer material.

The research will lead to new materials by combining dual dynamic crosslinking with polymers of controlled structure and new strategies for bonding carbon nanotube reinforcements to the matrix.  Polymers will be synthesized with control over chain-length, placement of crosslinkers along the chain, and density of crosslinkers. Diels-Alder chemistry will be used to dynamically bond the carbon nanotube reinforcements. Advanced structures such as interpenetrating networks and segmented polymers will be introduced to improve mechanical properties. Performance of each material will be evaluated through a number of mechanical and electrical tests, and lead to correlation of macroscopic properties with the underlying polymer structure. <br/><br/>Specific objectives of this research are:<br/>1.

Classically, the symmetries of a mathematical object form a ""group"", which is a set with a binary operation such as the integers with addition. In recent decades, we have seen the emergence of quantum mathematical objects whose symmetries form a group-like structure called a ""tensor category"", which has a collection of objects with a binary fusion operation. Tensor categories are said to encode quantum symmetry: they describe topological phases of matter in physics, and they give us quantum invariants of knots and 3-dimensional surfaces.  We are currently seeing the emergence of new mathematical objects which encode ""enriched"" quantum symmetry, which describe interfaces between 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional quantum systems. At this time, we have several competing formalisms. This project aims to unify these notions and produce exotic examples through classification. The educational component of this project includes undergraduate research and Summer schools on subfactors and quantum symmetry at the Ohio State University.  The project will incorporate the principal investigators current learning materials and those developed for these programs into a book on subfactor theory.  He will also collaborate with the STEAM Factory at Ohio State University to enhance general scientific and mathematical literacy in the community.<br/><br/>This project has two main focuses: the representation and the classification of these new enriched quantum symmetries. Unitary fusion categories have objects whose dimensions are not necessarily integers, so representing unitary fusion categories requires von Neumann factors, whose modules have a notion of continuous dimension.  In this project the principal investigator will use his previous experience in the classification of small index subfactors to classify quantum symmetries enriched in small unitary ribbon categories. This will study an enriched operator algebra theory to develop an enriched subfactor theory. The principal investigator will also develop the theory of bicommutant categories, which are a higher categorical analog of von Neumann algebras originally due to Henriques. These bicommutant categories have important connections to conformal field theory, and they are expected to be an important tool in the classification of enriched quantum symmetries."

Exciting early steps along this path include: i) the demonstration of arrays of quantum bits, ""qubits"", that can perform computational tasks and are on the verge of demonstrating the ability to outperform classical computers, ii) the development of nanoscale quantum sensors that allow for measurement of everything ranging from electric and magnetic fields to single photons, and iii) the development of ""flying qubits"" (tiny packets of light that travel through fiber optic cables) that are already enabling the implementation of quantum encryption that is un-hackable using current technology. The promise, however, rests on the development of systems that exhibit the exact quantum properties necessary to make a good computer, sensor, etc. Chemists have been manipulating atomic states for centuries in the design and synthesis of new molecules - making molecules prime candidates for the design of customized qubits and quantum systems. Early experiments have shown that this approach has promise, but the challenge is to get these molecules out of the beaker (so to speak) and onto a chip so that they can be connected to other supporting technologies. This project focuses on studying candidate molecules in these device-like environments, with the goal of learning the ""design rules"" for molecular quantum systems and designing new approaches to initialize and measure (write and read) quantum information. This work will take place in a collaborative network involving university scientists in the US and abroad as well as close contact with industrial partners interested in building the ""quantum infrastructure"" that will be necessary to support the emergence of quantum information sciences. This interdisciplinary environment will provide unique training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in the development of a quantum workforce. <br/><br/>This project will develop a general framework for the integration of molecular spin-based qubits into solid state architectures, harnessing the ability to tune quantum states in molecular systems via synthetic control of ligand fields and electron-nuclear spin coupling to demonstrate a unique approach to generating qubits-by-design. Both electron and nuclear spin qubits have been demonstrated in molecular systems with appropriately engineered ligands. This performance is comparable to other leading qubit systems based on diamond NV centers, silicon donors, and Josephson junctions, and enables chemical tuning to tailor the coherence properties for particular applications. However, the field has thus far relied on measurements of large ensembles in solution, precluding the study of single-qubit properties and impeding scaling and integration with existing and emerging quantum technologies. Addressing this challenge requires an interdisciplinary program that exploits a framework of spin-dynamical theory and modeling to bridge from the synthesis of chemical qubits, to the validation of their quantum coherent properties, to the ultimate goal of quantum coherent device engineering. This project will explore how the requirements of quantum functionality intersect with the phase spaces accessible to molecular design and synthesis at one extreme and device design and fabrication at the other. As it matures, this framework will develop into a roadmap for the design of molecule-based quantum-functional devices that will be of broad relevance to the quantum information community and provide guidance as to how molecule-based quantum devices might be most effectively integrated into larger quantum-functional architectures. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Quantum Leap Big Idea Program, the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water splitting allows energy from the sun to be stored in chemical form.  When these elements are recombined to form water, energy is released.  To meet the challenge of splitting water efficiently, new benign synthetic methods are developed to form new catalysts based on earth abundant elements. The new catalysts are also useful in understanding and mimicking some biological enzymes. This project has societal impact on sustainable energy generation, storage, and chemical processes.  The broader impact of this research comprises educational components, community outreach and engagement, along with undergraduate student mentorship.

The traditional method has involved adding small amounts of alloying elements to a base metal. This process led to creation of the most famous metal alloy, steel, which is responsible for the industrial revolution and consequently a giant leap forward in technological advances of the human civilization. Despite great progress in making advanced steels as well as other types of more modern alloys, such as Ni base alloys for high temperature applications and Al and Mg alloys for light weighting, there still remain numerous fundamental questions regarding the underlying mechanisms through which these materials respond to loading. The answer to this question is the most important consideration when designing load bearing structures, from buildings and bridges to cars and airplanes. Moreover, with the modern technological advances, there is an urgent need to design new materials, capable of enduring complicated and often contradictory conditions, such as strength, formability and exposure to extreme situations such as high temperature or corrosive environments. On the other hand, recent progress in metallurgy has opened up the possibility of creating multicomponent metal alloys with much more complex compositions than conventional alloys. This program seeks to establish a rigorous relationship between alloy composition, the way it is processed, and how it responds to loading, thereby providing a physics-based predictive path to design new alloys for tailored structural properties. The program combines advanced modeling and experimental approaches. Interesting compositions for study will be identified using cutting-edge computational techniques.  Experiments are designed to create predicted alloy compositions using efficient methods to rapidly explore a wide range of compositions, and characterization of internal material defects induced during deformation. In addition, this program will provide an opportunity to engage and train a diverse population of students from high school, to undergraduate and graduate levels, through hands on projects utilizing state of the art experimental and computational techniques to contribute towards educating the next generation of STEM workforce.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Novel, high-throughput computations and experiments are proposed over a wide range of compositions to test the hypothesis that deformation mechanisms and consequent properties in multicomponent fcc-based alloys can be favorably tuned by composition. This proposal seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of deformation mechanisms in a wide range of fcc solid solutions, including deviation from equiatomic compositions, and specifically to explore compositions for which twinning and hcp martensite effects may contribute to extraordinary strain hardening and ultimate strength potential.  Thus, the research objectives are to: (1) employ novel and efficient computational and combinatorial experimental approaches for creating desirable alloys; (2) understand the effect of stacking fault energy and relative fcc/hcp stability on the competing deformation mechanisms; (3) determine the evolution of deformation substructure with strain and the connection to remarkable strain hardening; and (4) characterize and model the deformation mechanisms operative at elevated temperature in association with anomalous hardening and dynamic strain aging.  An integrated computational/experimental framework will be applied to a broad range of CrCoNi ternary alloys, and to alloys beyond this ternary system, in order to make a direct, quantitative connection between the chemistry of fcc-based solid solutions, and active deformation mechanisms and mechanical behavior. A new Monte Carlo method based on density functional theory (DFT) recently developed by PI Ghazisaeidi will be employed to predict phase stability and segregation behavior.  Guided by these computations, PI Mills will conduct high-throughput experiments in order to reveal the complex relationships between composition, stacking fault energy, phase stability, and deformation mechanisms.  This proposal will challenge present measurements in low stacking fault energy alloys through in situ mechanical experiments which will enable improved correlation between experiment and DFT calculation.   Directly linking composition to phase stability and deformation mechanisms is necessary, as evidenced by the fact that TWIP steels with similar or lower stacking fault energies (when compared with CrCoNi) do not exhibit deformation-induced martensite (as does CrCoNi).  Study of these complex composition effects will be extended to higher temperatures where evidence for strong solute interaction is observed in mechanical response, such as anomalous hardening and serrated flow, but the chemical species and deformation mechanisms associated with these interactions have yet to be identified.  The proposed research will be extensible to other multicomponent alloys, including many important commercial alloys such as IN825, MP35, and Alloy 28 that share compositional commonality with the recently emerging fcc-based high entropy alloys, but presently lack detailed deformation mechanism understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This program will also support a scientific computing bootcamp for incoming graduate students in the University of Cincinnati physics bridge program, making sure that these students have necessary tools for success in graduate school and their future careers.<br/><br/>Primordial gravitational waves are a prediction of inflationary theories, which are the leading explanation for the initial conditions of our universe. The most powerful technique to search for these gravitational waves is using the B-mode (curl-type) polarization of the CMB, which is not sourced by density perturbations. However, primordial B-mode polarization must be very faint, so a critical challenge is to control all effects that might leak temperature or E-mode fluctuations into B-modes.  It is also necessary to separate primordial CMB signals from lensing-induced secondary anisotropies and Galactic foreground emission; these challenges require combining data across angular scales and observing frequencies at high fidelity. Past and current CMB experiments have demonstrated good control over systematic errors, but the raw sensitivity of CMB-S4 requires correspondingly lower levels of systematics. The CMB-S4 forecasting effort has provided guidelines for the acceptable level of spurious contamination in the maps, but detailed simulations are necessary to connect these limits to specifications on instrument design and calibration. The work supported by this award will establish these connections through a series of targeted simulation sets. The process of generating and analyzing these simulations will also contribute to the development of CMB-S4 data pipelines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over centuries, the thrust has been on development of macroscopic devices such as cars, planes, ships that are larger than the human beings. The new challenge is to develop miniature systems that could rectify the energy of environment into directed motion at the scale of micrometers. In the future, these micromachines are expected to interact with biological tissues and individual cells, serve as elementary units of soft microrobots, deliver microscopic quantities of drugs or other useful chemicals, work as energy harvesters, responsive actuators, microscale mixers and separators. Electric field is considered as one of the most effective means in powering the transport of matter at microscale.  Most of the studies of microdynamics are performed for an isotropic environment, such as water, which does not provide a clear sense of direction for electrically powered microsystems.  The goal of the project is to learn how one can control dynamics of microparticles by anisotropic fluids, with properties that depend on the direction in space. These fluids are known as liquid crystals.  Anisotropy of liquid crystals under the action of the electric field is already used in informational displays of modern computers, smartphones and TV sets. The project will explore how to use liquid crystals as a medium that enables and commands dynamics and interactions of microparticles. The project will advance the knowledge of mechanisms defining dynamics of soft matter at microscopic scales and potentially contribute to the technologies of future micromachines.    <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Collective out-of-equilibrium spatiotemporal dynamics of microscopic particles in the so-called active matter is a fascinating area of intense studies. Depending on the type of interactions, active matter develops various scenarios of behavior, from coordinated collective unidirectional motion to turbulent-like flows.  The project will explore how the electric field controls dynamics of colloidal particles and their interactions at microscale, using methods such as optical microscopy, confocal microscopy and particle velocimetry. The project will answer a question whether and how the seemingly chaotic dynamics of active matter can be controlled by an ordered environment of a liquid crystal.  The potential transformative value is in understanding the mechanisms by which the orientational order can command interactions and collective motion in ensembles of electrically powered active particles. The orientational order of the proposed LC environment imposes long-range anisotropic elastic and hydrodynamic interactions and propulsion modes that are absent in isotropic fluids. The project will advance the knowledge of electro-hydrodynamics of LCs and colloids, physics of out-of-equilibrium active matter.  Application of already tested methods such as three-dimensional confocal microscopy, particle imaging velocimetry, patterned photo-alignment and electro-optics will ensure that the new knowledge is based on a solid experimental background. The project will provide a new platform to design and control ensembles of active particles, which has the potential for enormous societal benefits in areas ranging from existing technologies (such as improved electrophoretic displays) to the technologies of the future, which would exploit the unique ability of active colloids to transduce energy from the environment into systematic movement, to control the flow of matter, to serve as important elements of micromachines.

A quantum phase transition takes place at zero temperature and describes a phase transition between competing ground states driven by an external parameter such as chemical composition, pressure, or magnetic field. The recent studies of unconventional superconductors show that superconductivity develops in proximity to a magnetically ordered phase. This raises the possibility of quantum phase transitions in these systems arising from competing types of such orders. The present studies of unconventional superconductors such as heavy fermions and iron-based superconductors mainly focus on the understanding of the normal state properties of these superconductors and on the mechanism of superconductivity. These studies enhance our fundamental understanding of the extent to which a quantum phase transition controls the finite temperature properties of these superconductors and promise insight into the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity of other unconventional superconductors. This new knowledge could provide a more global understanding of the phenomenon of unconventional SC. This highly interdisciplinary project allows graduate and undergraduate students to benefit from exposure to a diversity of experimental techniques, a variety of different physical systems and phenomena, and forefront topics in condensed matter physics. The diversity of the expertise gained by the participants in this research program is a substantial advantage in today's knowledge based, technology driven economy, being beneficial to a future career in industry, government, or academia. Professional mentoring is provided for the graduate students. The international collaborations with scientists in China contribute to the nation's infrastructure for research and education.

The goals of this research are to: (1) study coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity; (2) reveal quantum phase transitions; (3) study nature of quantum critical points; (4) study pseudogap region and search for nematic states; (5) facilitate the training of highly qualified personnel through comprehensive and multifaceted research and improve K-12 STEM education. The methods that are used in these studies are resistivity, magnetoresistivity, current-voltage, torque, thermoelectric power, and magnetization measurements. The proposed research will significantly enhance our fundamental understanding of quantum critical phenomena, arising from competing types of orders, in iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors. Specifically, it will address issues related with the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, and reveal the nature of the ground state, for example a conventional metal or an ordered phase, which would have appeared had superconductivity not intervened. Fundamentally, it will reveal the extent to which quantum criticality controls the finite temperature properties of these systems. This research could also contribute to a more global understanding of the novel phenomenon of unconventional superconductivity. Understanding the intrinsic electronic, magnetic, and magnetotransport mechanisms in these complex materials is critical to understanding the nature of strongly correlated materials and revealing the origin of unconventional superconductivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current materials design strategy often encounters the difficulties of inconsistent datasets and heuristically cost- and time-extensive optimization procedures. This work aims to propose a potential transforming strategy, combining mathematical modeling, molecular simulations, and experiments, to setup a simple yet robust polymer and coating system to collect a reliable benchmarking dataset for better assessing the component-structure-property-performance relationship of antifouling polymer coatings, and then to use this reliable source to develop a computational predictive model for the structural-based design of next-generation antifouling materials. This proposed research will contribute new knowledge related to new antifouling design and manufacture, promoting both the progress of science and advancing national prosperity. Educational and outreach activities will focus on strategies to enhance recruitment and retention of all-level students particularly from underrepresented groups and to help them to learn interdisciplinary knowledge and skills from polymer physics/chemistry, lab-on-chip design, and ergonomic engineering, thus promoting the next-generation of STEM education.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The main objective of this proposal is to develop a novel, cheminformatics-based strategy combining computational and experimental techniques to design new distinctive antifouling polymers by understanding and engineering the interfacial interactions between antifouling polymers and fouling species at different spatial and time scales. A synergistic large-data-driven computational approach will be developed to study interfacial interactions between proteins and polymer brushes at atomic level, and then to correlate interfacial interactions with their structure-property relationships and antifouling potentials. Then, a series of polymer brushes, as selected by computational design, with well-controlled surface properties, will be synthesized and tested for their combinatory effects of polymer chemistries and brush topological parameters on their antifouling performance. Finally, a QSAR model will be developed to better reconcile all quantitative computational and experimental data from the benchmarking dataset to describe a relationship among monomer structures, polymer architectures, structural-dependent physical/chemical/biological properties, and antifouling performance. The obtained antifouling materials can also serve as a basis for exploration of other bioactive properties for controlled nanoparticle synthesis, tissue engineering, and biocompatible surface modification.

Among other things, the weak interaction is responsible for the type of radioactive decay called beta decay in which a nucleus is transformed into a different nucleus with the emission of an electron and a neutrino.  The award will allow the two scientists to carry out experiments in which they precisely measure the energy of electrons emitted in four different nuclear beta decays. Three of these experiments will test key aspects of the Standard Model of the electroweak interaction, which is the theory that describes the unification of two of the fundamental forces, the weak interaction and the electromagnetic interaction. These precision beta decay measurements are complementary to particle collider experiments in the search for new physics. A fourth proposed experiment aims to resolve uncertainties in the beta decay of potassium-40, an important tool in geochronology. The research program has the further goal and benefit of training highly talented undergraduate physics students. Students involved will gain experience with state-of-the-art software and experimental techniques, and will learn to think independently and gain a variety of practical problem solving skills. The broader impact is felt when these students enter the workforce in STEM fields or in teaching. <br/><br/>The research program consists of several experiments involving the high precision measurement of the shapes of beta spectra. In two of the proposed experiments the goal is to provide a strong test of the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model of particle physics. In a third experiment, the goal is to improve limits on non-Standard-Model contributions (Fierz terms) to the description of the weak interaction. A fourth experiment has the goal of resolving an uncertainty in the potassium-40 beta spectrum, which is relevant to applications in geochronology. Specifically, the carbon-14 beta spectrum will be measured using a new magnetic spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This spectrometer will be nearly identical in form to the superconducting spectrometer used to make the same measurement in oxygen-14, enabling reduced uncertainties arising from higher order matrix element contributions. Measurements in fluorine-20 and helium-6 will be carried out at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory using implantation into a scintillator detector, which will have significantly different systematic effects from the magnetic spectrometer measurements and will be important in achieving low thresholds. A fourth experiment has the goal of measuring the shape of the potassium-40 beta spectrum. Knowledge of this spectrum shape is important for a standard technique in radioactive dating of geologic samples, but a recent report suggests the shape may not be as well understood as had been thought. An important aspect of all these measurements is in assessing and correcting for systematic effects through measurement and computational modeling."

One important question has to do with certain differences in how matter and anti-matter behave (so-called CP-violating effects). Such effects have been observed in the decays of exotic particles called mesons, but the differences that have so far been observed are much too small to explain, for example, why there is much more matter in the universe than anti-matter. For this and other reasons, it is believed that the Standard Model is incomplete. Thus, experimental searches for other types of CP-violating effects can provide information that might help to extend the Standard Model. The goal of this award is to design and build a new instrument to search for CP-violating effects in the annihilation of electrons and their anti-particles, positrons.  This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students at Wittenberg University, where the proportion of women physics majors is well above the national average. These students will work closely with faculty to develop, assemble, and test state-of-the-art instrumentation and will learn how to do research at the frontiers of science. The proposed apparatus will also enable a research project for at least one graduate student at Michigan State University.<br/><br/>This award is to develop a highly efficient, compact, symmetric, and high rate capable instrument which will enable the search for CP violation in the decay of tensor polarized Positronium (Ps). CP violation is known to occur in the weak decays of the K and B mesons and is described in the Standard Model (SM) through the CP-violating phase of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix. Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, a similar mechanism is also expected to exist in the neutrino sector. Searches for new mechanisms of CP violation in observables where SM CP-violating effects are strongly suppressed are considered among the most sensitive probes to search for new physics. They are also expected to provide possible microscopic explanations for the origin of the dominance of matter over anti-matter in the universe. The instrument to be developed will make possible an order of magnitude improvement in the measurement of a CP-violating correlation involving the spin of positronium and the momenta of the two most energetic gammas in the 3-gamma decay of positronium. The instrument consists of a positron source sandwiched between two thin plastic scintillators surrounded by a high porosity medium where positrons efficiently form positronium. This positronium production and tagging system will be surrounded by 48 LYSO scintillation crystals covering a large solid angle and segmented so as to select the most sensitive decay events. The entire detection system will be located inside the warm bore of an existing superconducting magnet available at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU). The extraction of the correlation term requires the determination of the tensor polarization of positronium, which will be deduced from the decay time spectrum of positronium. The start signal will be given by one of the thin scintillators and the stop signal by a pair of LYSO crystals in coincidence. The merit of the project resides in both the statistical and systematic sensitivity of the system. The group expects to get the current limit of 0.002 in a few hours and to improve it by one order of magnitude within a reasonable measuring time. In addition, the symmetry of the proposed instrument, and the fact that all configurations are measured simultaneously, eliminate the dominant systematic effects in the most precise previous measurement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) and are the subject of this investigation. This research will involve the work of undergraduate students at Otterbein University, a RUI. <br/><br/>This award will support the neutrino physics group at Otterbein University to work on two experiments, MicroBooNE and DUNE, both of which use large-scale liquid Argon time-projection chamber (TPC) technology. The DUNE experiment will send a high-intensity broad-band neutrino beam from Fermilab to a liquid argon TPC in the Homestake mine in South Dakota. DUNE will make precise measurements of neutrino oscillations and support an extensive astrophysics program. On MicroBooNE, the Otterbein group will continue to work on data analysis, particularly regarding measurements of low-level data quality and detector properties relevant for calibration and systematic errors. The group is the sole support for the MicroBooNE online monitor and event display systems. On DUNE, the group is just starting the first steps and are exploring opportunities in wire plane (APA) manufacturing databases, cryogenic instrumentation and slow control, trigger systems and event displays. All of this work will enable the crucial measurements that both experiments will make regarding the nature of neutrinos. A special contribution of this award and an exciting broader impact of this research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some applications, e.g., in the investigation of the brain activity from the measurement of the induced magnetic field in the space outside the skull, the relation between the unknown causes and the observed effects can be expressed as a linear function. In other cases, when the relationship is more complicated, the solution of linear inverse problems may have to be addressed as part of a more general solution scheme. While in principle easy to state, the solution of a linear system of equations arising from inverse problems can be extremely challenging, in particular when there is a mismatch between the number of observations and the degrees of freedom and when the dimensions of the problems are very large. When data collection is problematic because of the associated costs, technical difficulties, or health risks, the number of unknowns in the resulting linear system exceeds the number of equations. In order to produce a meaningful solution for such systems it is necessary to augment standard techniques with qualitative knowledge about the problem. This project concerns the design and analysis of computational methods for the solution of linear ill-posed problems that naturally translate qualitative information or belief about the data and the solution in quantitative terms. In particular, by formulating the problem within the framework of Bayesian inference, the project will develop mathematically sound and computationally efficient schemes for large scale problems where the disturbance in the data may be rather substantial and may have a statistics rather different from white noise. The Bayesian framework is the natural setting for expressing the a priori beliefs about the solution. The prior beliefs may vary widely from one time instance to another, or from one point in space to another, and it may be necessary to express them in hierarchical layers. Since this approach very closely resembles the way in which people formulate what they know and how knowledge is updated as new evidence arrives, it is expected that the methodology will be widely utilized. <br/><br/>The increasing popularity of complex models in inverse problems comes with an increase in associated computational costs. The methodology developed as part of this project addresses the need for computational efficiency by combining Bayesian inference with the Krylov subspace iterative methods, the natural choice for the solution of large scale linear systems. In this manner the philosophical appeal of the Bayesian framework is transformed in a very powerful Bayes-meets-Krylov computational scheme of wide applicability. The project provides an important connection between numerical linear algebra and Bayesian inference and will shed some light on how to link spectral properties of linear operators with statistical features of the unknown solution. Krylov subspace methods for inverse and ill-posed problems and the Bayesian solution of inverse problems are two very rich research areas which have received much interest, individually and jointly, in the last decade. There is experimental evidence that their symbiotic cooperation can be very advantageous in a variety of applications, but a solid understanding of the changes in the subspaces where the approximate solutions are sought and in approximation of the relevant eigenvalues in the associated Lanczos processes is still largely missing. The combination of theoretical and computational tools will fill this intellectual gap and open the way for the use of state-of-the-art iterative numerical solvers for very large ill-posed systems in the context of sequential Monte Carlo methods. This will reduce the gap between statistical uncertainty quantification and numerical linear algebra, to great advantage for both fields. In fact, the success of the Krylov-meets-Bayes approach, confirmed in a number of different settings and particularly in the solution of underdetermined problems, relies on left and right preconditioners to augment the quantitative data with additional qualitative information. Understanding the changes in the Krylov subspaces and in the associated Lanczos process induced by the statistically inspired preconditioners in discrete linear inverse problems is one of the aims of this project. In particular, the powerful tools of numerical linear algebra and the connection between Krylov subspace iterative solvers, the Lanczos process, and the associated orthogonal polynomials will be utilized to enlighten the connections and differences with classical schemes, including Tikhonov regularization. In the first part of the project, the analysis will be first carried out in the case of Gaussian prior and noise, and will be subsequently extended to the case of conditionally Gaussian prior, whose covariance matrix depends on unknown parameters, which are estimated via a nonlinear step as we learn more about the unknown of primary interest. In the latter case, the ensuing prior conditioners will be a parametrized family of matrices. Understanding how the spectral properties of the preconditioned systems change as functions of the parameters of the prior covariance will be part of the project; here, the connections with Gauss-type quadrature rules and moments may turn out be crucial."

A more precise knowledge of how different chemical structures interact (or ""stick"" together) has the potential to enable a better understanding of biochemical processes involved in diseases and to facilitate drug design. With the support of the NSF Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program, the research group of Professor Eric Masson at Ohio University designs and synthesizes hollow, pumpkin-shaped molecules that can accommodate two chemical entities in its hollow center. By bringing two chemical entities together, the Masson group seeks to determine how well they interact and to quantify the strength of their interactions at the molecular level. The research project involves graduate and undergraduate students (including students from underprivileged backgrounds) and trains them in organic, analytical and computational chemistry. Among other outreach activities, Professor Masson also co-organizes a yearly science communication and policy workshop held at Ohio University and at the University of Leipzig, Germany.  The workshop brings together students from chemistry, journalism and international studies at both institutions around scientific themes of societal interest. Through the workshop, students learn to communicate scientific concepts to non-scientists.<br/><br/>For the purpose of quantifying non-covalent interactions in both aqueous medium and in hydrophobic cavities surrounded by an aqueous environment, Professor Masson's group designs supramolecular systems that are water-compatible, versatile for evaluating a wide range of non-covalent interactions; and geometrically well-defined and far less complex than natural systems, to avoid secondary perturbations.  There are three specific aims in this project. In the first aim, the Cucurbituril (CB[n]) family of macrocycles is used to encapsulate highly hydrophilic guests and determine the strengths of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed inside the hydrophobic cavity of CB[n].  In the second aim, ""2:1 stacked"" ternary complexes of a variety of 4'- substituted platinum(II) terpyridyl complexes in curcubit[8]urils (CB[8]) are designed. These ternary complexes serve as self-sorting probes for quantifying Coulombic interactions between peptides as well as aryl-aryl ""pi-pi"" and aryl-cycloalkenyl CH-pi interactions in aqueous medium. The last aim exploits the use of the ""2:1 stacked"" ternary complexes as supramolecular balances for quantifying dispersive ""pi-pi"" and CH-pi interactions in aqueous medium. The supramolecular balance is formed by self-sorting of a platinum complex connected to a triptycene unit (the ""wheel"") with another platinum complex without triptycene (the ""shaft"") in CB[8].

These faculty members would serve as mentors to the students. Written results will be compiled and presented at an end-of-year symposium, similar to two existing innovative programs, the ACTION program and the SetGo program (NSF-funded) at BGSU, both of which have an undergraduate research component. A secondary focus is the training of other faculty in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at BGSU in computational science and data science, as well as faculty from other departments.

Courses in the COMAST program, as well as the summer workshops, would be taught in a computer classroom, designed to accommodate the instructional approaches that model data driven research.  COMAST graduates will be well positioned for new job opportunities because of their preparation, while faculty in other departments will look to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics for assistance in their research. Due to the workshops and webinars that will be made available for faculty at other institutions, along with workshops at ASA meetings, the content and teaching approaches of these new courses will be disseminated statewide and nationally."

The goal of this research is to study the forces between quarks inside the nucleon.  The project looks at how the quarks form quantum states of the nucleon after being bombarded by an energetic beam of particles, and studying how these quantum states release the energy in the form of new particles.  By comparing these measurements to theoretical calculations, we can learn more about the forces between quarks that are confined inside the nucleon. Two experiments are included in the effort. The first one at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) uses a beam of particles called pi-mesons that impinge on a proton, resulting in a nucleon resonance that decays into two pi-mesons.  This new experiment will expand by a factor of 100 the data for that reaction process.  The last data of this type was taken back in the 1970s, and now precise data for this final state are needed as input to theoretical calculations of nucleon resonances. The second experiment is at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, located in Newport News, Virginia. This experiment uses an electron beam impinging on a proton to create a nucleon resonance, with the final particles going into a large acceptance spectrometer, called CLAS12.  The nucleon resonance spectrum tells us about how quarks interact with each other inside the proton. Early career scientists, graduate, and undergraduate students play an important role in this project, which provides them with unique opportunities to further develop their training and education in leading research facilities.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to understand the proton and how its valence quarks can be excited into resonant states.  This moment is an exciting time to pursue this goal because we now have the theoretical tool of lattice gauge theory to calculate nucleon resonances from basic principles (the non-perturbative solutions to the equations of Quantum Chromodynamics, or QCD).  As an analogy, measurements of excited states of atomic hydrogen led first to the simplified Bohr model, then to calculations using Schrodinger's equation, and finally to QED.  Similarly, measurements of the excited states of the nucleon (N*'s) led first to the simplified constituent quark model, and then to calculations directly from QCD using lattice gauge theory. The latter predicts many more N* resonances than have been extracted from experimental data.  Known as the missing baryons problem, it continues to motivate research on N* spectroscopy.  The two experiments described above, one at J-PARC and the other at CLAS12, will help to resolve the N* spectrum and ultimately provide a proving ground for theoretical models of quarks."

This program, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, engages students in research projects spanning the field of chemistry. Students work on these projects, which are carefully designed for the 10-week timeline, under the guidance of faculty mentors. Alongside the hands-on research projects, students attend seminars and workshops to learn about current real-life scientific challenges such as ?Data Science for Big Data in Chemistry? and ?Sustainable Chemistry.? Students also take part in professional development activities, giving them the opportunity to develop as young professionals and researchers. Taken together, these activities prepare students to enter the STEM workforce as informed, knowledgeable professionals with a strong understanding of the challenges and opportunities before them.<br/><br/>The students engage in research projects spanning the field of chemistry, from solid-state photochemistry, to computational biochemistry, to biocompatible polymers, to electrocatalysis. The projects are designed for the 10-week timeline such that each student may advance scientific knowledge, including through refereed publications and a presentation at a suitable scientific meeting. Professional and skill development activities include workshops on reading scientific journals, creating individual professional development plans, and data science in chemistry.  While this site is open to all, a focus on minority recruiting and the involvement of a faculty member from an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) expands and strengthens diversity in the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
