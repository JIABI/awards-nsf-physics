Despite their apparent complexity, many such systems exhibit a form of underlying organized structure (``building blocks''), whose discovery would enhance our ability to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena. The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of mathematical and algorithmic tools that can harness the information content of large datasets acquired from experiments and observations to create coherent representations of complex systems, and use these representations to perform prediction, and ultimately, control. These objectives will be addressed through a novel combination of mathematical techniques, bridging dynamical systems theory and differential geometry with machine learning and data science. The newly developed techniques will be tested and applied in real-world problems through collaboration with domain experts in the areas of climate dynamics, space physics, and condensed matter physics. The project will also contribute to STEM workforce and curricular development through training of students and postdoctoral researchers, and design of multi-disciplinary lecture courses.      <br/><br/>The modern scientific method is undergoing an evolutionary change wherein large data sets and machine learning algorithms have the potential to outperform classical first-principles approaches for certain complex phenomena.  For these tools to be accepted by the scientific community, a rigorous mathematical framework is required to match the verifiability and quantifiability of the classical modeling approach.  Recently, a new tool called the diffusion forecast has been developed based on provably consistent estimators, which learn the unknown structure of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems on manifolds.  Moreover, the results of many published numerical experiments indicate that this framework can be applied far beyond the restricted context of the current theory.  In particular, the evidence suggests that the consistency proofs can be extended to non-autonomous projections of complex systems, deterministic chaotic systems represented by non-compact operators, non-smooth domains such as fractal attractors, and even generalized tensors on metric-measure spaces. This project will undertake a rigorous mathematical unification of these problems, leading to transformative advances in our ability to model and describe complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A century after Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, the two Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors opened a new window on the universe by discovering gravitational waves passing through Earth, emanating from cataclysmic, distant events: colliding black holes and neutron stars. The phenomenal precision that LIGO needs to clearly observe these faint waves requires exquisitely isolated detectors. Capturing the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars requires accurate waveform models. This award will establish a new research group at Christopher Newport University (CNU) to address both of these challenges, through characterizing LIGO detectors to better understand the origins of problematic noise in the detectors, and by improving the waveform models used to interpret the astrophysics of observed signals. Through these projects, the CNU group will play a crucial role in improving the quality of the LIGO detector data and the accuracy of the parameter estimation information that is shared with the astronomical community and the public. The students supported by this award will be trained in computer programming, data analysis, and machine learning. These important transferable skills will prepare the students for a wide range of successful and meaningful STEM careers in academia and industry. <br/> <br/>LIGO?s sensitivity to gravitational waves is limited by non-stationary noise, which fluctuates over time depending on various environmental influences. This work will extend a method developed by the PI with collaborators to correlate these variations in sensitivity with auxiliary instrumental sensors to determine the most possible causes, using lasso linear regression. This method has already been useful for identifying noise sources that change over the course of hours, but this work will target problematic persistent noise transients, which impede gravitational wave searches and have rates varying over the course of days and weeks. The PI and students will also contribute to data quality validation of gravitational wave candidate events, to ensure that the broader astronomical community has access to necessary data quality information. The expected improvements to LIGO in the coming years will enable the observation of many more black holes, doubtless some with interestingly different properties and some potentially having much higher signal-to-noise ratios. Accurately extracting the astrophysical parameters of these signals requires comparing to template waveforms that span the potential discovery space. The PI and her students will work on surrogate modeling (a way to efficiently interpolate between expensive but accurate numerical relativity waveforms), working with members of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes collaboration. This work will enhance our ability to interpret black hole observations, especially those with large spins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their use in practice depends on their reliability and efficiency. Reliability requires a fine-tuning of the model parameters and an accurate assessment of the sensitivity to noisy inputs. Efficiency is particularly critical in optimization problems, where the computational procedure identifies the best working conditions of a complex system.  These requirements lead to solving models with millions or even billions of unknowns many times. This process may require days or weeks of computations on high-performance computing facilities. To mitigate these costs, we need new modeling strategies that allow model-runs in minutes to hours on local computing facilities.  Reduced order models (ROMs) are low-dimensional approximations that can decrease the computational cost of current computational models by orders of magnitude. Having in mind biomedical and wind-engineering applications, this project proposes novel methods of model reduction. Data and numerical results from the expensive (or high-fidelity) models are combined with machine learning approaches, to obtain ROMs that attain both efficiency and accuracy at an unprecedented level. The new data-driven ROM framework will make possible the numerical simulation of aortic dissections, pediatric surgery, or wind farm optimization on a laptop in minutes, and aims at becoming a critical and trustworthy tool in decision-making processes. This project will support one graduate student each year at each of the three institutions.<br/><br/>Data assimilation (DA), uncertainty quantification (UQ), and shape optimization (SO) are central to the development of computational models for significant biomedical and engineering applications.   Since these applications require a large number of model simulations, running an expensive full order model (FOM) is generally prohibitively expensive.  For systems that display dominant structures, reduced order models (ROMs) can decrease the FOM computational cost by orders of magnitude. Thus, for the clinical and engineering applications above, ROMs appear as a natural and practical alternative to the prohibitively expensive FOMs running on high-performance computing facilities. Unfortunately, to capture all the geometric scales in the hemodynamics of aortic dissections or to cope with the large Reynolds number in the wind farm optimization, hundreds and thousands of ROM modes are necessary. These relatively high-dimensional ROMs are still not viable to effectively perform DA, UQ, or SO for these applications.  What is needed is ROMs that are not only low-dimensional and efficient, but also accurate.  To develop ROMs that are accurate in realistic, under-resolved regimes, the ROM closure problem needs to be solved, that is, the effect of the discarded ROM modes on the ROM dynamics needs to be modeled. The proposed research puts forth a new data-driven ROM paradigm that centers around the hierarchical structure of variational multiscale (VMS) methodology and utilizes modern machine learning and numerical and observational data to develop structural ROM closures that can dramatically increase the ROM accuracy at a modest computational cost.  The novel data-driven VMS-ROM paradigm maintains the low computational cost of current ROMs but dramatically increases the ROM accuracy.  Biomedical applications in thoracic and pediatric surgery (aortic dissections and Fontan procedure ? where the fate of the patient depends significantly on the shape of the vessels) as well as wind-engineering applications are specifically targeted. The data-driven VMS-ROM framework will finally make possible the efficient DA, UQ, and SO in these and, possibly, other fields relying on mathematical and computational modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiple observations of the same phenomenon rarely produce identical results. Statistical noise may be the first complication that comes to mind, but there are plenty of other possible discrepancies as well: different antenna arrangements; different camera angles; different modalities, e.g., images and text; and more. Inferring the true underlying phenomenon requires sophisticated mathematics. This project focuses on matrix methods. Hiding within the simple numerical entries of a matrix are intricate patterns called eigenvectors that are connected to the harmonics of musical instruments. Even though different kinds of measurements may produce different numerical values, they may share the same eigenvectors when observing the same objects. One of the goals of the project is to pull consistency out of inconsistent data. In theory, measurements on the same object from different instruments should agree in certain ways, but because of statistical noise and other sources of error and uncertainty, each instrument provides an inexact view of the world, and the two instruments will not agree perfectly with each other. The goal is to bring the measurements into alignment using mathematics and therefore likely into better agreement with the true state of the universe. The project will be completed at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution, and introducing undergraduate students to research in STEM fields is a primary objective.<br/><br/>The mathematical focus of the project is simultaneous diagonalization of commuting Hermitian matrices. In theory, commuting Hermitian matrices share a common eigenvector matrix. However, numerically-computed eigenvectors may differ wildly in the presence of ill conditioning. A numerical method for simultaneous diagonalization seeks, either explicitly or implicitly, small perturbations of the input matrices that commute exactly. The project objectives include contributions to theory, method, and application. First, a reconsideration of ""near commutativity"" is planned, in which eigenvalues are fixed in place and attention shifts from the space of Hermitian matrices to the unitary group of eigenvector matrices. Second, the project will pursue new numerical methods for simultaneous diagonalization, motivated in part by relatively recent spectral divide-and-conquer methods. Third, the new approaches will be applied to applications such as independent component analysis and unsupervised machine learning with multimodal data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Corrosion is everywhere, in cars and water pipes to name a few, and most metals will break down over time which can lead in the most extreme case to catastrophic failure. The annual cost incurred in the U.S. by corrosion is more than 3% of the gross national product. Protecting materials from corrosion is critical to the design of new materials.  How fast a material corrodes and degrades depends strongly on the environmental conditions, such as temperature, and humidity, salinity, noxious fumes, and radiation. Often, coatings are placed on materials that protects it from rusting rapidly.  For example, Ni-based superalloy are used in turbine blades for energy production and propelling airplanes, yet they degrade rapidly in the extreme high temperature environment.  Small additions of elements are often added, such as W, Mo, Cr, to these alloys to dramatically reduce corrosion.  This work combines forefront experimental and computational tools to gain understanding at the atomic scale on how rust develops from the initial oxygen striking the surface of a material to the development of a protective oxide in Ni-based superalloys, and the beneficial role of adding certain elements to control and reduce corrosion.   Such knowledge will benefit the design of future alloys, especially those used in extreme environments.  This work will contribute to graduate and undergraduate research experiences.  Furthermore, a video-based portfolio of on-demand lectures will be developed through a collaboration between University of Virginia and James Madison University.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>Dry and aqueous corrosion/oxidation are leading causes of materials loss, and catastrophic failure. Corrosion resistance is therefore included as a design criterium in alloy engineering. The proposed work will advance understanding of oxidation mechanisms in Ni-based superalloys with Cr, Mo, and W as alloying elements. Mechanistic understanding of the initial reaction sequence where the alloy surface transforms into an oxide layer, is achieved by probing the geometric, electronic, and chemical structure in alloy and oxide at the nanometer scale. This work advances fundamental understanding of oxidation, and will  infuse the development of computational methods to design protective coatings and better alloys. This proposal aims to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of the initial steps in alloy oxidation of binary and ternary Ni-based alloys. The formation of oxide layers on Ni-Cr, and Ni-Cr-Mo or Ni-Cr-W alloys is studied with methods traditionally used in surface science and catalysis and afford the requisite geometric, electronic, and chemical information at the nanoscale. This includes scanning tunneling microscopy, and electron spectroscopies at synchrotron facilities with in-situ and operando observations starting with the clean alloy all the way to the closed oxide layer for a wide range of alloy composition and processing conditions (T, p(O2)). The majority of experiments are positioned in a regime where NiO and chromia formation compete. Monte Carlo methods, and density functional theory are used to model the element distribution in the pristine alloy and combined with experimental studies of segregation, and diffusivity to understand the near-surface Cr inventory in various alloys. Surface phase transformations, reconstructions, and element-specific nucleation pathways contribute to the development of oxide heterogeneity and are dramatically modified by minor alloying elements (W, Mo). The propagation of heterogeneity into the Cabrera-Mott regime is tested with operando experiments (ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies). The materials knowledge developed in this proposal will provide an understanding of mechanisms at the atomic scale, which are critical to infuse computational approaches, including machine learning approaches, and to achieve future predictive capabilities. A video-based portfolio of on-demand Surface Science lectures will be developed  integrating textbook knowledge and pertinent literature. These videos build the knowledge base in surface science, corrosion, catalysis, thin film growth and analytical techniques for undergraduate and graduate students at UVa and James Madison University (Prof. Baber), a primarily undergraduate institution. The PI is committed to outreach and diversity, and will recruit UG students for the proposed research project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to elucidate the aging mechanisms of ceramic battery materials. The research creates fundamental knowledge on the material science of batteries via a close integration of novel experimental and modeling approaches. On the education front, the multifaceted collaboration between Purdue University, Virginia Tech, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory provides unique training opportunities for the students in this project. Efforts will continue to encourage underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students to join the project. Outreach efforts in collaboration with the Women in Engineering Program at Purdue University and Destination Areas at Virginia Tech will continue to promote the participation of women in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The overarching goal of this project is to understand the defect inception, accumulation, and growth at the interface or within the grains, and the inter-relationship of defect-microstructure-performance of Li-ion batteries using the operando synchrotron X-ray analytical techniques, environmental nanoindentation, and data mining.

The computation-experiment-feedback loop coupled with machine learning and high throughput computation will result in heretofore unrealized linkages of entropy-induced material stability, thermal properties, and corrosion resistance. The project will result in advances in fundamental understanding and discovery of novel materials that can be designed for specific extreme environment applications. The computational approach to materials discovery will utilize AFLOW: high throughput property prediction. These predictions will be tested by characterizing rare earth silicates synthesized via solid state sintering, chemical techniques for improved cation mixing, and gas phase pulsed laser deposition of thin films.  Phase stability and chemical disorder will be characterized through use of techniques including X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Resulting stability of rare earth silicate mixtures will inform improvements in the computational approach for materials discovery. Additionally, computational approaches will be used to predict phonon transport and thermal properties. These predicted thermal properties will be compared against thermal conductivity measurements as a function of temperature through use of time domain and steady state thermoreflectance, and hot disk techniques. Environmental stability will be experimentally characterized using ""steam-jet"" testing, an extreme environment laboratory test creating high-temperature, high-velocity, reactive steam representative of the combustion environment.

The many different ways by which these dyes respond to changes in their environment in solution, organized media and the solid state are being investigated.  These responsive dye materials change color when scratched, crushed or smeared, and can self-erase with time. As such, they can find use as sensors, optical memory materials, security inks, intelligence contexts, pigments for art and other products.  Students from diverse backgrounds obtain multifaceted training in a multidisciplinary environment, engage with a network of local, national and international collaborators and learn science communication skills.

Informed by computation, this is accomplished by preparing material sets designed to modulate luminescence properties in solution, nanoscale lipid assemblies and molecular solids. Dyes with donor-acceptor substituents, molecular rotors, lipids and other organizing groups are synthesized. Optical properties (emission, lifetime, quantum yield, ultrafast photoluminescence decay) are measured in solution and compared to computed spectra and frontier molecular orbitals. Solvatochromic and viscochromic effects are probed, relevant to investigations with liposomes, membranes and mechanistic probe development. Aggregation induced emission studies characterize the transition from solution to the solid state, whereas dye/polymer blends probe solid-state solvatochromism (dielectric, polar dopants, dye-dye interactions), rigidochromic effects (polymer glass transition temperature, crystallinity), and ML mechanisms, and are readily processable for potential uses. Powder and single crystal XRD provide information about order, dye-dye interactions, and molecular structure, whereas AFM reveals crystallinity and thin film morphologies in molecular solids. Dye assemblies are modeled computationally. Super cooled liquids are investigated by DSC, and mechanochromic properties of dyes are studied for thin films on weigh paper and glass along with new substrates with promising behaviors. A laptop/RGB camera imaging system will characterize dynamic optical effects such as ML recovery, supercooled liquid crystallization, and other luminescence changes in films and assemblies. The expected outcomes of this research are greater fundamental understanding of boron and diketone dye properties in solution, organized lipid media and the solid state. This will lead to more rational design of stimuli responsive, luminescent boron and diketone materials for imaging, sensing and detection applications."

Date: April 4-5, 2019. The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of first meeting is Stochastic Optimization. Stochastic optimization problems arise in virtually all science and engineering fields. Common examples of stochastic optimization problems are: (i) determining an allocation of financial assets that minimize the potential for loss subject to market variability; (ii) controlling injection wells in second-stage oil recovery to maximize the net present value of a reservoir in which the subsurface rock properties are unknown; and (iii) designing a photonic meta-material to maximize light absorption subject to uncertain operating environments. For each of these problems, a decision maker must choose an allocation/control/design prior to observing the uncertain outcome (i.e., decisions are deterministic).  As a result, one must properly quantify the risks associated with each decision in order to control the outcome variability.  This need has led to the modern theory of stochastic and in particular risk-averse optimization. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two of the best researchers in stochastic optimization and thus help train next generation of scientists. In addition, there will be four invited talks from the experts in the field and the students and postdocs will have an opportunity to share their work via contributed presentations. The knowledge gained during the meeting will be of relevance to fields such as finance, physics, biology, data science, machine (deep learning), and engineering. The meeting has an affiliation from Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM).<br/> <br/>Accurately representing the uncertainty when solving stochastic optimization problems often requires an enormous number of samples, which traditionally resulted in intractable nonlinear optimization problem.  However, owing to the recent advances in high-performance computing, computational simulation and numerical optimization, the numerical solution of such problems has become computationally feasible.  Additionally, this past year, four stochastic optimization researchers received prestigious awards including two Dantzig Award winners (one of our keynote speaker was among the two), a Khachiyan Prize winner and a Farkas Prize winner.  For these reasons, the topic of stochastic optimization is very timely for the inaugural East Coast Optimization Meeting. The proposed meeting has the potential to advance knowledge and understanding in modeling, optimization, numerical analysis, implementation and software development. Stochastic optimization encompasses numerous aspects from statistics, probability theory, optimization and variational analysis, convex analysis, and applied mathematics.  The meeting will stimulate new developments in these important areas of mathematics. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on real life problems and will discuss new optimization solvers to handle these problems. Thus the attendees can tackle new set of challenging problems. The variety of topics discussed in the meeting, stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, risk averse optimization is of much wider interest. For instance, these are relevant in finance, physics, biology, data science, and engineering. Participation from all these fields is expected. The ideas created in the meeting will be actively disseminated. We will upload the lecture notes on the conference website. These resources will help create new graduate courses.

Normally, charged polymers are very flexible and do not have strong mechanical properties.  This project involves a solid material formed from a mixture of a very rigid and strong charged polymer (similar to Kevlar(R)) and an ionic liquid (also known as a molten salt).  This new material, which is called a molecular ionic composite (MIC), combines the best properties of solids and liquids.  MIC materials are stiff and non-flammable solids and yet they can conduct ions like lithium and sodium with very low resistance, as if the ions were in a liquid.  The properties of MICs can also be widely tailored for potential use in different applications such as water purifiers, electromechanical sensors, or artificial muscles.  This project will combine cutting edge research tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray analyses, materials science theories, and computational molecular simulations in order to build fundamental understanding of how MIC materials work.  By combining such interdisciplinary knowledge and insights, these researchers will work to create new designs for MIC materials for devices such as safer, cheaper, and more lightweight lithium batteries.   This project shows promise for feeding into advanced battery materials technology, thus enabling a potential new avenue for US business impact on the $20B global battery market.

It builds on the discovery of a new class of polymeric ion conductors that are termed molecular ionic composites (MICs).  The prototypical MICs, formed from a rigid-rod anion-containing polymer and an ionic liquid (IL), exhibit the following special combination of tunable properties: ionic conductivity up to 8 mS/cm, widely tunable elastic modulus (0.01&#8722;3 GPa), and thermal stability up to 300 degrees C.  MICs show promise for allowing use of metal electrodes in lithium and sodium batteries, potentially enabling higher energy density as well as battery operation over a wide temperature range and with inherent fire resistance.  While these materials display impressive properties, researchers are only beginning to understand the origins of why such fast ion transport is commensurate with such a stiff and robust material matrix.  This project combines fundamental polymer analyses involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray scattering, and microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations and theories of conduction and oriented matter.  Better understanding of the fundamental nature of MICs could feed into design of new compositions to meet desired requirements for battery electrolytes or other molecular separations applications.  Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain new knowledge about these novel polymeric conductors, and this new knowledge will be integrated into polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus and propagated to K-12 children and their parents in an educational outreach program based in Southwest Virginia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar energy is the most abundant form of renewable energy on earth, but is limited by a discontinuous supply. It is therefore critical to develop a way to harness and store solar energy as an energy dense chemical fuel that is compatible with our current infrastructure. Through a process called artificial photosynthesis (AP), sunlight is harnessed and used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas is used directly as a fuel, or is combined with oxygen in a hydrogen fuel cell to generate electricity. Owing to expensive materials and inefficient catalysts, hydrogen generation through AP is significantly more expensive than hydrogen generated from fossil fuels. The use of hydrogen fuel cells to convert solar fuels into electricity is also limited by the use of expensive materials (platinum). In this project, Dr. William R. McNamara devises a photocatalytic system for hydrogen generation using cost-effective iron catalysts. The use of inexpensive iron catalysts for the efficient reduction of oxygen gas in hydrogen fuel cells is also investigated. Within this project, several outreach activities promote the development of future generations of scientists. Dr. McNamara is conducting an after-school program at a local public high school with a high concentration of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through this program students actively conduct research in a meaningful and accessible way. These activities advance public scientific literacy while encouraging underrepresented groups to pursue careers in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the National Science Foundation supports the effort of Dr. William R. McNamara at the College of William and Mary towards the development of inexpensive materials for both photocatalytic hydrogen generation and the oxygen reduction reaction of hydrogen fuel cells. The immobilization of robust iron polypyridyl hydrogen generation catalysts on charge-separating supports (carbon nanotubes, TiO2 and SrTiO3) is characterized using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy. Hydrogen generation is promoted using an LED photolysis system and analyzed with gas chromatography. In order to decrease cost and improve the widespread applicability of photocatalytic hydrogen generation, the use of naturally occurring humic substances to replace traditional sacrificial donors is also investigated. Additionally, iron polypyridyl sulfinate catalysts are examined for the oxygen reduction reaction in hydrogen fuel cells. Rotating ring disk voltammetry (RRDV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) are used to evaluate catalytic performance. Rigorous treatment of the data using foot-of-the-wave analysis (FOWA) is also employed to better understand mechanism. Funding from the NSF provides for the training of 15 different students (primarily undergraduates) in this multi-disciplinary research effort. Additionally, Dr. McNamara conducts an after-school research program at a local public high school with a high concentration of underrepresented groups in science. Consistent with the broader impacts of this project, these activities promote the engagement of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines and increase public engagement in the sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will also serve as valuable training for students. Open-source codes will be made available to the user community and will be open to contributions from end-users, academic researchers, industry members, practitioners, and government research labs.

We leverage this breadth to produce REU problems that lie on the intersection of two domains of knowledge, in which both faculty members are likely to be able to make significant contributions.  The intradisciplinary nature of the teams supports the student experience by putting the mentors on similar footing as the students insofar as each mentor will likely be teaching and learning something new. This interaction helps lower the barrier for student collaboration and increases intellectual risk-taking across the entire group, particularly in the initial stages of research.  It also immediately creates a group with a cohesive intellectual culture for students to interact in, both academically and socially.  Each group of students will complete the summer with a mathematical research presentation to faculty and peers. They will also be well prepared and strongly encouraged to present at local, regional and national meetings after the completion of the program.

A prominent example of this are graphene based polymeric materials, where graphene?s lack of compatibility/solubility is commonly overcome by approaches that compromise its superior electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties and make the composite materials less attractive for future development. This project attempts to overcome this obstacle by utilizing the high-energy interface between two immiscible solvents to force stacked graphene sheets to exfoliate and spread. Lowering the overall free energy of the system drives this rearrangement of sheets. This research is centered on the development of a unifying theoretical, computational and experimental framework to describe the behavior of two-dimensional materials at the liquid/liquid interface. The approach is multi-scale, reaching from the atomic to mesoscopic dimensions. Using graphene and boron nitride as examples, this work will reveal general selection principles for solvent pairs and reaction conditions for which the novel concept of using two-dimensional sheets as surfactants can be realized. The understanding of the governing physical principles of surface activity of graphene and boron nitride will be applied to form emulsions that serve as precursors for the synthesis of foam-like materials reinforced with graphene or boron nitride. The developed theoretical and computational models of these composite foams aim at the design of materials with optimized mechanical and electrical properties. These design tools will be tested and calibrated through experimental studies at nano- and meso-length scales. Ultimately, the work will outline design principles for nanostructured, multifunctional, two-dimensional surfactant-reinforced polymeric composites with tailored properties, enabling material development in a fraction of the time that would be required by a trial and error approach alone. The reinforced polymeric materials have the potential to be used as strong and lightweight structural materials, electrodes in capacitors and batteries, substrates for flexible electronics, electrically conductive, high surface area catalyst supports, and super-absorbent materials.

This radiation traveling a straight path catches up with the electron beam and can severely degrade its experimental usefulness.  The first step in mitigating these damaging effects is to develop a trustworthy computer code capable of simulating the physics of this beam self-interaction. This project will enable the development of such a code. For the society in general, this research is a step in developing ultra-bright light sources which are essential tools for discoveries and innovations in physical, biological, energy and medical sciences.

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award is to support the NSF-funded DarkSide (DS) groups for the construction and operation of DarkSide-20k (DS-20k), a direct WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 tons (20 tons).<br/><br/>The LAr TPC relies heavily on the utilization of argon obtained from underground sources, or UAr.

DS-50 demonstrated an 39Ar reduction of 1400 in the UAr. Electron recoil (ER) background was shown to be completely suppressed in the region of interest, with discrimination better than 1 part in 1.5 x 10^7.

The university is a comprehensive institution of higher education, dedicated to the promotion of learning, building of character and preparation of promising students for positions of leadership and service. The Hampton-Brandeis Partnership for Research & Education in Materials (PREM) between Hampton University and Brandeis University Materials Research Science & Engineering Center (MRSEC) includes the strengthening and expansion of collaborative research and education between these two institutions. The overall goal of the Hampton-Brandeis PREM is to increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of talented minority students in materials science and engineering related fields. In addition, an important ancillary goal is to increase the research capacity and productivity at Hampton. The PREM will increase the number of African-American and women students in materials science and engineering research careers and markedly expand the supply of scientists and engineers contributing to innovation and discovery to fuel the growth of the American economy. This will be accomplished by: (1) increasing the number of undergraduate and graduate students participating in materials science research activities, (2) implementing the PREM Path-to-Professorship (PtP) Post-doctoral Fellowship Program to prepare a new cohort of early career faculty for HBCUs, (3) developing a sustainable outreach program in materials science and engineering for middle and high school students in the Hampton Roads region and (4) increasing communication of materials science and engineering to audiences across the continuum, from peers to general public, by all Hampton PREM participants. The Hampton-Brandeis PREM's overall goal is to serve as a catalyst for the recruitment and retention of talented students pursuing research careers in materials science and engineering fields. <br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>The Hampton-Brandeis PREM research seeks to study the photo-responsive, opto-active, and optoelectric properties of photonic materials for microfluidic and optofluidic applications. The proposed research for Thrust 1 aims to develop a new type of photoswitchable low-molecular-weight-gelators by integrating dipeptide derivatives which are known to be versatile self-assembly motifs, with a novel family of arylazopyrazole based molecular photoswitches possessing metal binding functionality. In Thrust 2, opto-active biomaterials will be designed and their interactions with cells will be studied to assess their capabilities of being extracellular matrix surrogates, through metrics such as degradation, growth factor release and adaptable/tunable mechanical properties. Fluorogenic protease-sensitive peptide (FPSP) sequences will be developed, and subsequently, the critical cross link density of FPSPs in polyurethane casts will be determined to visualize/quantify cellular proteolytic activity in real-time. Thrust 3, which focuses on opto-electronic materials, will investigate mixed halide perovskites and semiconductors. The proposed research on the development of mixed halide perovskites will include purification studies of commercial precursors, solution-based synthesis, solid-state mechano-chemical synthesis, and crystallization from the melt. Doping studies using rare earth and transition metal ions will be performed to explore improved long-term stability as well as extended emission wavelength coverage in the UV-VIS and IR spectral region. In addition, the research will focus on the characterization of silicon, compound semiconductors, and mixed halide perovskite materials for optofluidic applications. The study aims to determine the optical properties (emission, absorption, transparency, etc.), mechanical properties to support microfluidic fabrication processes, and the electrical properties for circuitry and heterogeneous interfacing of materials. Lastly, research will be conducted to explore how the identities (science, racial and gender) of minority materials science undergraduates and their participation in PREM impact their recruitment, retention and achievement in materials science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is concerned with more complicated algebraic structures, in which we not only have operations, but operations between operations, and so forth. Such structures have a number of applications, but there are many possible ways to describe them, and much of the project is concerned with developing such descriptions and showing that they are essentially equivalent to one another.  In a related project, The PI will use these kinds of foundational tools to make new connections between the fields of algebraic K-theory and representation theory.  In the latter, certain algebraic structures called Hall algebras bear several similarities to those that appear in K-theory, yet a precise relationship is still unknown.  Some new examples suggest a path for making a more explicit comparison.  A third project, which is being done in collaboration with four other women through the Women in Topology program, is concerned with applying some of these methods to structures which resemble the Taylor series which appear in calculus.  In addition to this program for supporting junior women researchers, the activities of this proposal also include supporting graduate students, developing research with undergraduate students, and participating in programs to promote further diversity in the mathematics community.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with developing and applying different models for homotopical categorical structures in three main directions. In the first, the PI will seek to give a full description of all models for higher homotopical categories given by multisimplicial and globular diagrams of simplicial sets. Such models are given by Segal conditions and either discreteness or completeness conditions; most current work emphasizes completeness but we seek to incorporate models with discreteness, and in particular consider in which cases we can use a combination of the two kinds of conditions.  The second direction is to look at applications of 2-Segal spaces in algebraic K-theory. These structures are known to arise via the Waldhausen S-construction, but how they can actually be used in algebraic K-theory is yet to be investigated. The PI will give an explicit comparison between 2-Segal spaces and the CGW-categories of Campbell and Zakharevich, and to develop the analogues of their abelian CGW-categories. Because 2-Segal spaces are also deeply connected to Hall algebra constructions, we seek to understand how CGW-categories fit into this picture, and more broadly just what Hall algebras have to do with algebraic K-theory.  Finally, the PI will look at model category structures in discrete and abelian functor calculus, with the goal of comparison to other kinds of functor calculus for which model structures have also been developed, as well as of strengthening classification results for homogeneous functors.  This last project will be done as part of the Women in Topology workshop, in collaboration with four other women, three of whom are junior researchers.  This project includes support for graduate students working on related problems and ideas for undergraduate research projects which would facilitate students learning more about these areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New approaches are needed as the achievable transistor density is reaching fundamental limits and the energy requirements for computing continue to grow. Next-generation technologies must therefore offer enhanced performance with reduced energy consumption. This project focuses on addressing the challenge of sustainable computing by developing materials capable of neuromorphic and spintronic computing behaviors. Neuromorphic computation mimics the brain by networking solid-state analogues of the neuron, which in turn provides hardware learning capabilities with low energy costs. Spintronics is a radically different field where computing occurs by shifting electron spin rather than charge, yielding speed boosts and improved efficiency over charge-based technology. This research team seeks to develop a material capable of combining these approaches by optimized alloying of transitional metal dichalcogenides, a class of atomically-thin materials, to create a new spintronic material that could mimic the biological neuron. The alloys investigated in the project could serve as the foundation of a neuromorphic-spintronic network that would fundamentally transform computing by combining the benefits of each technology. The research effort includes graduate, undergraduate and high school researchers in these studies and will promote interdisciplinary materials research while mentoring students at the Mason Innovation eXchange.<br/><br/>Technical Description: 2D transition metal dichalcogenides offer versatile electronic and structural properties based upon the choice of transition metal and chalcogen atoms, making them attractive for next-generation computation technologies. New behaviors can be engineered into these materials by developing ternary alloys, which in turn can enable unconventional device concepts. This project combines the intrinsic versatility of transition metal dichalcogenides with alloy engineering to address the challenge of sustainable computing technology by creating a material that can support both spintronic and neuromorphic behaviors. The primary objectives of this research are: 1) explore the phase diagram of a ternary transition metal dichalcogenide alloy to identify the composition optimal for achieving on-demand structural phase transitions; 2) evaluate the optical and electronic properties of the alloys to understand the impact of chalcogen substitution on spintronic functionality; and 3) trigger structural phase transitions in the alloy using heat, strain, or charge, and confirm the spintronic properties survive multiple switching cycles. Demonstrating these essential behaviors aims to prove the hypothesis that ternary transition metal dichalcogenide alloys are suitable for the future development of a combined neuromorphic-spintronic network."

With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Matthew Hartman at Virginia Commonwealth University and Dr. Irene Chen at University of California-Santa Barbara to investigate how the molecular rigidities of peptides determine their binding affinities to proteins.  This project uses new and powerful technologies to create molecular collections, or libraries, containing trillions of molecules with diverse ranges of defined rigidities. These peptide libraries are tested for their affinities to proteins with rigid binding pockets or with more flexible binding surfaces. The resulting trends will streamline the discovery of peptide molecules that inhibit biologically and clinically important proteins.  This project provides opportunities for interdisciplinary research training and career mentoring to a diverse population of graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented minority groups. In addition, a module is developed that uses Lego construction toys to introduce upper elementary students to the concept and power of molecular diversity.<br/><br/>Peptide libraries are powerful storehouses for the development of protein ligands and inhibitors of protein-protein interactions; molecules that are scarce in standard small molecule libraries. This project addresses the potential benefits of introducing conformational constraints into peptide libraries to answer two questions about the relationship of peptide flexibility and target affinity: does rigidification inherently improve binding affinity; and, are high-affinity binders with rigid structures more rare compared to flexible structures of similar affinity within a library? To answer these questions, peptide libraries are created with matched hydrophobicity and sequence diversity, but increasing levels of rigidity. These libraries will be tested against streptavidin (with a compact and rigid binding site and that recognizes contiguous amino acid motifs), and a prototypical SH3 domain (with an extended and flexible binding surface) to study the dependence on the structure of the protein targets. This wholesale analysis of the prevalence of binders and affinities of peptides selected from each library answers the guiding questions concerning the relationship of rigidity to affinity. Dr. Hartman through this project provides training in chemical biology to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students at Virginia Commonwealth University. He and his group are also developing the Plickers-based activities to engage elementary school students (including those from underrepresented minority groups) in learning about molecular interactions and mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Think of designing the wing of an aircraft where it is essential that it can withstand a tremendous amount of pressure. This is just one of the example of an optimization problem with constrains. Such problems are inherently nonlinear due to constraints. This makes the development and analysis of algorithms and numerical techniques for the solution of these problems extremely challenging but rewarding. This project will create new optimization algorithms that allows us to incorporate constraints in a systematic and robust fashion. The targeted applications range from next generation micro- and nano-scale lab-on-chip devices to novel material and structural designs. Open source software will be created so that the research can be easily used by scientists working in other research areas.<br/> <br/>The applications under consideration can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs). These PDEs are  nonlocal (fractional); nonsmooth (contact problems); geometric, nonlinear, multiscale with an unknown domain, i.e. free boundary problems (FBPs). This project focuses on optimization problems with such PDE constraints - the so-called PDE constrained optimization problems. It aims to create new optimization schemes that will enable the solution of currently intractable optimization problems with nonsmooth features, including: optimization problems with nonlinear inequality constraints, contact problems, and risk-averse PDE constrained optimization. The resulting optimization algorithms will provide new insights into nonconvex nonsmooth problems. Optimization problems with surface tension is a new research field with great potential to enhance our understanding at the micro and nano-scales where surface effects dominate bulk effects. This will impact the design of next generation lab-on-chip, forensics and liquid lenses in astronomical telescopes. Open source software will be developed, which will not only benefit scientists in optimization, FBPs, and nonlocal problems but also scientists in nonlinear PDEs and data driven optimization problems.

Organic dye sensitizers are molecules that can be used to harvest sunlight for energy related applications. They work by absorbing the light needed to excite an electron in the dye to a higher energy level. This high energy electron is then transferred to a semiconducting material. The use of an organic dye sensitizer for this effort is particularly attractive because they are made of earth-abundant, inexpensive materials. However, their use also comes with a cost in that their use is frequently complicated by the low efficiency of electron-transfer between the dye and the semiconductor and the poor long-term stability of the dye-semiconductor complex. The goal of this project is to solve these problems by learning how to optimize the light-harvesting ability of organic dye sensitizers while maintaining both the electron-transfer efficiency and stability of the dye-semiconductor complexes. By addressing these problems, the Wustholz group is contributing to efforts to address current issues related to the growing demand for renewable energy. At the same time, the research is providing meaningful research and developmental experiences for undergraduate and master's degree students who are being trained in physical, analytical, and materials chemistry. During the budget period, the Wustholz group is continuing its efforts to develop the research and communication skills of underrepresented students through long-term, mentored research experiences, as well as outreach activities that are aimed at increasing the number of such students that are exposed to meaningful scientific experiences. <br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to understand the interfacial interactions and electron-transfer processes occurring in organic-dye-based systems for dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysis.

In this work, the Wustholz group will pursue three main strategies to understand and optimize the optical and electronic properties of organic-dye-based systems for solar-to-electrical and solar-to-fuel conversion: 1) determine the structure-activity relationships of surface-aggregated organic dyes, 2) elucidate the interfacial electron-transfer processes and kinetic dispersion at the molecular level, and 3) probe the impact of operational variables on molecular aggregation and interfacial kinetics for surface-anchored organic dyes. This project contributes to our fundamental understanding of solar energy conversion and to the development of new approaches to efficiently convert solar photons into chemical energy."

Over cosmic time, some of these massive BHs will come together, forming a massive black hole binary (MBHB), and eventually merge. MBHBs also accrete nearby matter, and this accretion flow has an important impact on the merger itself. A research collaboration between Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Virginia will help to answer the question, what are the properties of accretion flows in the vicinity of coalescing massive black hole binaries? The answer to this question has direct implications for the feasibility of coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescences. Such detections are considered the next observational grand challenge that will provide a more complete understanding of evolution and growth of these massive objects. In anticipation of future detections by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this team of collaborators will investigate the coincident EM and GW signatures of MBHBs immersed in accretion flows. There are three goals of this program that are complementary to the proposed research and enabled by the investigators' roles as scientists and educators. The first is to  promote diversity in STEM through direct participation of women and members of underrepresented groups. The second is to introduce innovations in teaching and learning based on ideas drawn from this project. The third will be reached through a continued commitment to public engagement and outreach.

We leverage this breadth to produce REU problems that lie on the intersection of two domains of knowledge, in which both faculty members are likely to be able to make significant contributions.  Over the course of the summer, each group will progress from teaching/learning new topics in mathematics or statistics, to developing questions and conjectures, to proving results as part of an authentic research experience.  Since faculty have distinct but related research interests, they are able to model supportive scientific collaboration for the students and discuss technical topics from different points of view.  The program provides professional development and outreach activities for students, and produces original research that is disseminated in peer-reviewed journal articles as well as talks at national, regional, and local professional meetings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonequilibrium phenomena are omnipresent and range from weather patterns to life itself. For systems that are out of equilibrium two complementary aspects, both equally relevant, can be distinguished. These are stationary states, wherein the system will remain if not pushed from the outside, and the relaxation towards these stationary states. Gaining a better understanding of both the stationary properties and the relaxation processes are needed in order to fully understand the world around us, and to develop new ways to use these processes for tailoring the properties of various systems of interest, ranging from novel materials to biological systems and ecosystems. <br/>The study of systems far from equilibrium poses many challenges, both on the fundamental and on the practical level. Whereas there is a well-established theoretical framework for equilibrium systems, a similar comprehensive framework for non-equilibrium systems and processes remains elusive. This project aims at exploiting a variety of analytical and numerical techniques to advance understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena. The project covers both fundamental and applied aspects. One important activity focuses on the investigation of the stability of food webs to various perturbations, as for example species extinction, species migration or seasonal changes. Related to this is the question of ecomanagement and the targeted intervention in predator-prey systems in order to achieve specific goals, as for example maintaining  biodiversity or removing a detrimental species. Another activity investigates the relaxation properties in model systems used to describe synchronization phenomena in biology. This investigation will allow to explore possible relationships between physical and biological aging.<br/>The project is designed so that both undergraduate and graduate students can learn and contribute in a substantial and meaningful way. This training through research approach allows to involve students at every level in cutting-edge research projects.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education toward developing a theory of systems far from equilibrium. Non-equilibrium processes in nature and in human activities, such as making and processing materials, abound, and a unifying theoretical description of non-equilibrium interacting many-body systems remains elusive. The study of specific model systems can lead to progress in understanding systems far from equilibrium through revealing universal properties, using the large toolbox of numerical and analytical methods provided by statistical physics. The PI will combine advanced analytical and numerical techniques to address fundamental questions and potential applications of systems far from equilibrium through three different research thrusts. The first research thrust focuses on directed spin models that are prototypical examples of system that evolve to the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution even though detailed balance is violated due to the irreversibility of the dynamics. Preliminary results for the two-dimensional directed Ising model show that in the low temperature phase directedness yields a remarkable acceleration of the dynamics, manifested by a change in the value of the dynamical exponent. The research on directed spin models, addresses both fundamental aspects, such as change in dynamic properties due to irreversibility, and applied aspects, such as algorithmic tools to accelerate convergence to equilibrium. New insights into the properties of systems that violate detailed balance but fulfill the weaker condition of global balance are expected to result. For some classes of systems, directed models have the potential to become an algorithmic tool to accelerate convergence to equilibrium, which could have impact on many disciplines. The second research thrust proposes to investigate relaxation processes and the responses to perturbations in many-species systems. Food webs, discussed in the context of population dynamics, allow to gain insights into generic issues related to biodiversity and species extinction. Many of these food webs exhibit remarkable space-time patterns in a spatial setting that warrant an in-depth characterization. The PI plans (1) to study the stability of an ecological system, more specifically its response to perturbations, both small and large, and how it relaxes to the steady state, and (2) to investigate the control of an ecology, for example in order to assure biodiversity and avoid species extinction. Optimal control theory will be exploited as an analytical tool for understanding targeted interventions in predator-prey systems. This study is expected to yield valuable insights into the ecomanagement of non-trivial food webs. The third research thrust is devoted to the study of physical aging in coupled classical rotators. Coupled classical rotators and related systems present a class of systems with dynamic properties reminiscent of spin glasses. The PI will study the aging properties of these systems, investigate their responses to perturbations, and explore the existence of memory and rejuvenation effects. This study of coupled oscillators and related systems, with known biological applications, will provide an opportunity to explore possible relationships between physical and biological aging.<br/><br/>Due to the ubiquity of non-equilibrium processes in nature, this research project may have impact beyond the boundaries of condensed matter physics. Gaining a better understanding of transient and steady-state properties in systems amenable to an in-depth investigation using the large toolbox of statistical physics should contribute to the development of a more general theory that describes systems far from equilibrium. This project is designed so that both undergraduate and graduate students can learn and contribute in a substantial and meaningful way. This training through research approach allows to involve students at every level in cutting-edge research projects."

Harbron of the Department of Chemistry at the College of William and Mary prepares and studies nanoparticles which act as amplifiers for photochemical (light-induced) reactions. As one example, chemotherapy drugs can be attached to light-reactive (photoreactive) molecules which release their drug only at the site of the tumor instead of throughout the body. Photoreactive molecules must react efficiently so that the dose of light is minimized, but not so efficiently that they react when exposed to normal room light. In order to optimize this process, Professor Harbron's research group synthesizes photoreactive nanoparticles by combining fluorescent polymers with photoreactive molecules. In these new nanoparticles, the polymer gathers light energy and delivers it to the attached photoreactive molecules. The current project develops applications in the photorelease of small molecules and in the production and detection of reactive oxygen species. Applications are envisioned in photodynamic therapy and sensor development. This project also serves as training for undergraduate and master's level research students, who learn organic, physical, and analytical chemistry techniques while receiving academic and career planning advise. Outside of the lab, Professor Harbron continues to work as a mentor with the Chemistry Women Mentorship Network and with the William and Mary Scholars Undergraduate Research Program, which seeks to develop research skills in students from underrepresented groups. Professor Harbron founded and chairs a new Diversity, Outreach, and Publicity committee in her department that is working to broaden participation in science and promote scientific dialogue on campus. <br/><br/>Light is an appealing stimulus for molecular transformations because it can be delivered to a sample with high spatiotemporal resolution and control of exposure energy and intensity. In conjunction with light stimulation, photoresponsive molecules are being used in an increasing number of exciting applications, from imaging to catalysis. The ideal photoresponsive substance reacts efficiently with light and yet not so efficiently that it responds to ambient light in an uncontrolled fashion. Achieving this balance in reactivity is one of the major challenges in the field.  Other challenges include water solubility and tuning light responsiveness into the visible to near-infrared region. To address these challenges, the current project pairs photoresponsive dyes with conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs).  These are exceptionally bright fluorophores that absorb and emit in the visible to near-infrared.  They can be suspended in water. When doped with dyes, CPNs act as powerful light harvesters, funneling the energy of hundreds of chromophores to a single dye molecule via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Pairing the CPNs' efficient excitation and energy transfer processes with a dye's less efficient photochemical reaction amplifies the reactivity of the dye in a controlled fashion. This project optimizes the ""controlled amplification"" approach and extends it to address photoreactivity challenges. The specific aims are: to develop CPNs doped with photoremovable protecting groups to enhance and control photorelease, and to use CPNs doped with photochromic dyes to quantify the CPN properties that maximize photoreactivity.  The research also seeks to develop CPNs that both generate superoxide and report on its relative concentration via ratiometric fluorescence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum optics is the field of study of particles of light, photons, and their interaction with matter.   Cold atom physics is the investigation of cold atoms and their interaction with light and with other matter.  (Atoms can be cooled to as low a temperature as about 50 picokelvin, a thrillionth of a degree above absolute zero.  For comparison, the cold near vacuum of outer space is about 3 Kelvin, and room temperature is about 300 Kelvin.)  These joined scientific areas have led to improved atomic clocks, development of sensors of magnetic and electric fields, measurements of gravitational forces, and rotational motion, to name a few.  At the same time, entirely new areas of practical and fundamental investigation been developed, including quantum simulations of materials and plasma physics, and the dynamic research area of quantum informatics.  This project is focused on experimental and theoretical study of single-photon super radiance and sub radiance in cold atomic gases.  These are emergent effects, which do not occur for single atoms by themselves, but require cooperative interactions among a group of atoms.  In super radiance, light emitted from a gas of cold atoms does so at a rate much faster than from a single atom.  The light also is emitted in a narrow cone and behaves like a jet of photons.  In sub radiance, the converse is true; light emerges on the average in all directions, at a very slow rate, and can even be stored for a long period of time in the gas.  These fundamental quantum optical processes are accompanied by a shift of the frequency (or wavelength) and loss of the purity of the color of the emitted light.  As such, these effects can have a negative influence on the performance of atomic clocks or other precision sensors.   Thorough understanding of super and sub radiance, one of the main goals of this project, is thus essential to optimizing the operation of these devices.   On the other hand, it is possible to use these effects to advantage to form the basis of a single photon memory for light.  In this case, a photon is taken up in a super radiant state, and quickly transferred to a long lived sub radiant configuration.  At a later controllable time the atomic gas can be switched back to a super radiant state, in which the stored photon is reemitted into its original mode.  <br/><br/>The main scientific focus of this project is to study and understand the phenomenology of single photon super and sub radiance in cold atomic gases, and to learn about the impact of these processes on quantum sensors, and possible applications to single photon quantum memories. In the project, a dense and cold sample of cold rubidium atoms is optically prepared and interrogated by a narrow-band and near-resonance probe beam.  The atomic sample is elliptical with large aspect ratio, and is typically optically excited along the long axis.  This geometry has been shown theoretically to lead to an enhanced collective Lamb frequency shift in the forward scattered light.  The probe beam is prepared as a temporally short pulse for time resolved studies and is considerably longer and spectrally narrower for frequency shift measurements.  Enhanced and rapid emission is observed in the near-forward direction, while both super radiant and sub radiant emission is studied in an off-axis configuration. In initial studies, single photon super radiance is observed; the rate for the process is found to increase linearly with increasing optical depth, characteristic of a cooperative process.  A spectral shift of the resonance to lower frequency, with linear dependence on the optical depth, has also been measured.  Current and developing aspects of the project include study of (a) superradiant pulse propagation effects in the dense gas. These can modify the linear cooperative scaling and limit the practical applications; (b) few-body collective effects including two-body super and sub radiance; (c) the influence of inhomogeneous broadening process, such as Doppler broadening and trap induced light shifts on mixing and controlled coupling between super and sub radiant configurations."

The experiment will be done with the Nab spectrometer that is presently being installed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This project also prepares the way for an extension of the program, in which two more parameters, A and B, can be determined. The precise measurement of these parameters furthers a better understanding of the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. The goal of this experimental program is to test the Standard Model of particles and interactions in regions that were inaccessible before, or not as precise. A discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model would have important implications for nuclear and particle physics, as well as cosmology.  The project will have a valuable impact on higher education:  most of the work will be done by students at undergraduate and graduate levels, and these students will learn valuable skills and experiences for their future careers. <br/><br/>More specifically, the motivation for the experimental program for the Nab experiment is to (1) determine the ratio of the coupling constants in free neutron beta decay, lambda =g_V/g_A, with unprecedented precision, (2) to contribute to a test of the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, and (3) to search for non-Standard Model (SM) forms of weak interaction that manifest themselves as scalar and/or tensor interactions, that is, which interact with fermions with the ""wrong"" helicity. The current Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science devotes a paragraph to this effort. The studies are performed by the Nab collaboration, of which the PI is the experiment manager and the DOE project manager. The award supports the specific contributions of the PI and his group, the most important of which are the characterization of the superconducting magnet, the assembly and characterization of the spectrometer vacuum system, high voltage and main electrodes, and the characterization of the efficiency of the proton detection in a dedicated proton source.   The PI is responsible for the development of the present main analysis method for Nab. In addition, the PI will work on the planning of the future program, which is the analysis of uncertainties for the ""A"" and ""B"" coefficients, and the preliminary design and prototype testing of a novel supermirror polarizer concept that would minimize the leading systematic uncertainty in those measurements. The project will have a valuable impact on higher education. Several undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable research experience working on the proposed projects.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes as well as others form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The William and Mary Group is searching for evidence of CP Violation (related to the imbalance of matter and antimatter in the universe) with the NOvA experiment and is studying how neutrinos interact in normal matter with the MINERvA experiment.   The group is also engaged in R&D for DUNE, the next generation, long baseline neutrino experiment with endpoints at Fermilab in Illinois which provides the neutrino beam and the Sanford Underground Laboratory in South Dakota which is home for the detectors.   Presently under test are large detector prototypes called ""ProtoDUNEs"", which are massive liquid-Argon based detectors called Time Projection Chambers.  The testing is underway at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, and will guide the development of the massive detectors that will be built for DUNE in the next decade.<br/><br/>The William and Mary group is committed to engaging undergraduates in research as a vital component of their undergraduate education.   Beyond promoting science education at the College, the group operates a successful Emerging Scholars  program at a local elementary school. This ten-week, after-school program exposes students who are from communities historically underrepresented in the sciences to practicing physicists and exciting science activities. The program was developed in consultation with the Coordinator for Gifted and Talented Students of the Williamsburg- James City County schools and has grown and been strengthened based on feedback from follow-up discussions with the students and notes from in-session observations by specialists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are important to study since supernovae seed the galaxy with atomic elements made in the star and in the explosion, and they help astronomers to understand how stars evolve and die.  One of the ways astronomers study supernovae is by observing how the matter ejected in the SNe interacts with the gaseous material surrounding the star, producing a shock wave.   In order to help to interpret such observations, a research team at the University of Virginia will carry out a program to investigate the interaction of a supernova with a dense circumstellar medium.  Their study will include hydrodynamic computer simulations, modeling of energy transfer in the form of electromagnetic radiation, and calculations of physical conditions in the shock.  By better defining the nature of the circumstellar media involved in these events, this research seeks to fill gaps in stellar evolution theory. The principal investigator will give annual public lectures at the McCormick Observatory, near the university, as well as talks for elderly persons given at accessible sites. A graduate student and an undergraduate student will be involved in the research and will learn techniques used in theoretical astrophysics, as well as ways of approaching open questions. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to investigate the interaction of a supernova with a dense, possibly optically thick, circumstellar medium. The physical conditions are more extreme than ordinarily encountered in supernova interactions and the structure of the mass loss region is probably complex. The researchers will develop diagnostics for the conditions in and structure of the interaction. Specific topics that will be addressed include the shock wave structure and hydrodynamic instabilities when cooling is important, consistent models for X-ray and ultraviolet/optical shock emission, pre-shock ionization and emission, nonthermal particles and radio emission and absorption, and infrared emission from the radiative heating of dust. The models will be compared to multiwavelength observations, from radio to X-rays.  The research will relate the findings for observed interacting supernovae to plausible mechanisms for driving the pre-supernova mass loss. Supernovae that have narrow line characteristics are inferred to have a dense, slow moving circumstellar medium. These characteristics are observed over a broad range of supernova types, including those with and without hydrogen lines, superluminous supernovae, supernovae with Type Ia characteristics, and possible low energy supernovae. For these events, neither the mechanism driving the mass loss nor the timing with the supernova is understood, although narrow line supernovae make up about 9% of Type II supernovae. By better defining the nature of the circumstellar media involved in these events, this research seeks to fill gaps in stellar evolution theory. In addition, aspects of the physical processes in dense media should be more broadly applicable, for example to the dense media in active galactic nuclei.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much remains to be learned from these novel observations. Through a better understanding of the predictions of Einstein's theory and through more precise calculations of the emitted gravitational waves, more of the scientific potential of these observations will be tapped. This project, therefore, outlines a research program to use a combination of foundational computations, as well as analytical and numerical modeling of black holes and neutron stars, to aid in extracting insights from gravitational-wave observations. Many of the calculations will be carried out by graduate students, who will be trained in techniques that are useful in physics research and other quantitative areas.

These include the spectacularly successful Standard Model of Particle Interactions, the quantum phenomena in exotic materials that hold out great promise for new technologies such as quantum computing or energy storage and transfer, as well as theories that aim to uncover the fundamental laws of nature, such as String Theory. There has been tremendous progress in Quantum Field Theory over the past thirty years, and many questions that seemed intractable have been given precise and incisive answers. This project will build on those results by tackling a number of timely questions in Quantum Field Theory within realms where many of the standard tools are misleading or inapplicable.  The project will also address questions in two-dimensional Quantum Field Theory, relevant both for the physics of exotic two-dimensional materials and for the emergent geometry of spacetime in String Theory. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. This project will also have significant broader impacts. Crucially, it will involve undergraduate researchers, who will be given a unique opportunity to engage in theoretical physics research and have early exposure to the mathematical and physical ideas at the forefront of current explorations.  This research will also be interdisciplinary, bringing together collaborations of physicists and mathematicians, and it will be presented in public lectures to convey the exciting progress in and enthusiasm for research in theoretical physics. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Melnikov's work will explore foundational questions in conformal field theory and geometry in two-dimensional quantum field theory relevant to string compactification. In this setting powerful symmetries and constraints from spacetime geometry will help to give precise quantitative insights into strongly coupled quantum field theory and string propagation in non-trivial spacetimes. The project will address three concrete problems: (i) the characterization of obstructions to marginal deformations of supersymmetric conformal field theories and their relation to spacetime physics of the heterotic string; (ii) the identification of marginal deformations of conformal theories with local operators in asymptotically free gauge theories that reduce to the conformal theory in the low-energy limit;  and (iii) the discovery of new conformal theories that enlarge the landscape of string vacua.  It will bear on long-standing issues in stringy geometry and the mathematics and physics of (0,2) mirror symmetry --- a significant generalization of the mirror correspondence. The concrete lessons learned will also have wider applicability in low-dimensional quantum field theory at strong coupling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The detection of GWs from the binary neutron star merger, GW170817, when combined with the coincident GRB detection, GRB 170817A, and the electromagnetic follow-up campaign that discovered associated afterglows across the electromagnetic spectrum, has had a significant impact on the understanding of the progenitors of short GRBs, kilonovae, and the equation of state of neutron stars. This collection of observations and discoveries has demonstrated the capabilities of multi-messenger astronomy with the addition GWs.  These successes of the first and second Observing Runs of The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the French-Italian Virgo detector are now being expanded upon, as these detectors began observing the universe at sensitivities never before achieved in their third Observing Run, starting in April of 2019.  This award will support the search for GWs associated with new GRB events, for which only one coincident detection has so far been made.  The award will also support the search for GWs associated with fast radio bursts (FRB), which are extremely short-lived and extremely energetic bursts radio waves first detected by radio telescopes in 2007.  The progenitors of FRBs are completely unknown, and many astronomers are actively trying to detect more of these events to learn what might cause them.  Any detection of a GW associated with a FRB would result in a significant increase in the understanding of the astrophysical origin of these mysterious events.  The award will support the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through the training of undergraduate and masters students to become competent scientific researchers able to conduct research at the internationally recognized level as the next generation of gravitational-wave astronomers.<br/><br/>As was demonstrated with the multi-messenger observations of GW170817, combined detections of GWs with electromagnetic detections have significantly advanced the understanding of astrophysics of high-energy events.  This award will support the search for GWs associated with GRBs using a coherent, matched-filter search for compact binary coalescence sources.  These searches will be conducted in response to announced GRB detections, and any GWs detected will be announced to the astronomical community for prompt follow-up. This search extends the effective sensitivity of the GW detection network beyond that of an all-sky search by using the information provided by the external trigger's sky location.  Additional detections of GWs associated with GRBs in the third and fourth observing runs of LIGO and complimentary Virgo data will enable the astrophysical properties of neutron stars to be better constrained. Additionally, the full electromagnetic emission model for these binary neutron star merger sources will be refined with future multi-messenger observations.  This award will also support the coherent, template-based search for GWs associated with fast radio bursts (FRB).  Currently, the models of FRB progenitors are poorly constrained, and very few candidate progenitor sources have been eliminated due to a combination of the paucity of bursts detected thus far and a lack of multispectral observations. If a GW were detected with a template-based search in LIGO and Virgo data and found to be associated with a FRB, this would immediately indicate that the source of FRBs are binary neutron star mergers or neutron star-black hole mergers. At the same time, if no coincident detections are made in this search, this will better constrain models of the FRB progenitors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It was Charles Ehresmann in 1935 who started the study of deformation spaces of geometric structures, asking which ""shapes"" can be ""locally modeled"" on a certain geometry. In 1982 William Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, now a theorem, thanks to Grigori Perelman, renewed the interest in locally homogeneous spaces, that is spaces that look the same at each point. The PI proposes to study families of structures on manifolds and how they change when one perturbs them, focusing in particular on geometric and dynamical aspects. As a broader impact, the PI wants to develop a more inclusive environment for undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs and early career mathematicians. She proposes to organize: a Directed Reading Program which pairs undergraduate students with graduate mentors for independent projects; a Women in Geometry and Topology network with a website, annual dinners at conferences and summer retreats where participants will start mutual collaborations; a Mid-Atlantic Math Alliance Program to build a regional community of mentors who will work with underrepresented minority students to help them succeed in their careers; Log Cabin Conferences gathering a small group of researchers (many early career) in a remote location to learn a new topic in a collaborative atmosphere. In addition, she plans to continue organize the Diversity Lecture Series, an annual Sonia Day for middle school girls, the Math Club for undergraduate students at UVa, to be faculty advisor for the AWM Student Chapter, mentor for the AWM program and for the Math Alliance program, to organize the Geometry Seminar, the Virginia Topology Conference and annual graduate reading courses.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic structures are the prototypical example of geometric structures with interesting deformation spaces. The PI wants to use results and techniques developed in the context of hyperbolic structures for studying other geometric structures. For example, she plans to investigate analogue structures in anti-de Sitter space. A lot of deformation spaces arise from spaces of representations of the fundamental group of a manifold into a Lie group, so the PI is also planning to continue the study of the dynamical decomposition of character varieties of free groups, and of fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds with compressible boundary. Finally, the PI wants to study ""higher Teichmueller theory,"" that is ""nice'"" representations of a surface group into Lie groups of higher real rank, and Anosov representations, which are a dynamical analogue of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Since Anosov representations turn out to be generalizations of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one Lie groups to the context of discrete subgroups of Lie groups of higher rank, the PI plans to use techniques developed for Kleinian groups in order to study limits of Anosov representations. Differently from classical Teichmuller theory, it is not known, in general, if these representations are holonomies of geometric structures. The PI wants to study this question, together with the description of limits of these representations and a different topology on these spaces, the geometric topology. The PI thinks that results and techniques coming from differential geometry and low-dimensional topology will inspire new research directions with deep connections with dynamical systems, Lie theory, complex analysis, and even algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, he is building molecules in the shape of cubic containers that can encapsulate other molecules.  Potential applications include their use as capsules for the delivery of drugs to target organs, where they can be selectively released.  To realize such applications, Professor Thoburn and his team of undergraduate students are studying the underlying chemical reactions of these molecular cubes.  They address questions such as how the molecular cubes close and open to catch and release their guest molecules, and how the guests can be used to probe the interior structure of the cube. In addition to scientific advancements, this project features a number of broader societal impacts including the development of an international collaboration with Cambridge University, the preparation of undergraduate students for advanced work in science, and the preparation of economically-disadvantaged high school students for careers in STEM.<br/><br/>Professor Thoburn is investigating how an Fe8II(Porphyrin)6 metal-organic molecular cube encapsulates large guests such as coronene and how the coronene re-orients within the cube.  To further probe the host-guest interactions, Professor Thoburn is synthesizing tetracyanoazulene, which is capable of coordinating to Zn2+ ions embedded in the porphyrin faces of the cube.  Co-encapsulation of these electron-deficient tetracyanoazulenes with electron-rich cyclic thiophenes can create charge-transfer triads stabilized by the molecular cube.  To make these metallocubes more amenable to broader applications, Professor Thoburn is appending polyethylene glycol chains increase their solubility.

MASON is a nascent regional conference in number theory whose main goal is to promote and sustain communication and collaboration among number theorists from the Mid-Atlantic region (defined to include the states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia). The Mid-Atlantic has a growing and diverse community of number theorists. The need for a regular meeting like MASON is especially acute among students (both graduate and advanced undergraduates) and researchers at the many comprehensive and primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. MASON conferences will bring members of these groups in contact with one another and with distinguished number theorists. Thus, the meetings will be an important venue for professional development and networking for Ph.D. candidates, junior mathematicians and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions. Moreover, MASON meetings will provide opportunities for the recruitment of students into graduate programs and for contacts between academic and non-academic mathematicians with interests in number theory. The award will be used primarily to support the traveling expenses of students, postdocs, and faculty without institutional travel support to the next three MASON conferences: MASON II in April of 2018 at Towson University; MASON III in the spring of 2019 at James Madison University; and MASON IV in 2020 at Gettysburg College. <br/><br/>MASON meetings will feature plenary lectures by leading experts in number theory and parallel sessions of contributed talks by participants. Each MASON meeting will feature also a problem session. The scientific focus of the conference will be on the following areas within number theory: algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, automorphic forms and L-functions, elementary and combinatorial number theory, modular forms, and the theory of partitions. The plenary lectures will introduce the audience to recent breakthroughs in these areas, which represent--in broad strokes--the spectrum of interests of researchers in the region. In the contributed talks, participants will have the opportunity to report on their own research and to learn from each other. MASON meetings will also be venues to forge future research collaborations, both among number theorists and between number theorists and research mathematicians in related mathematical fields. <br/><br/>More information about MASON can be found at the main MASON website: <br/>https://wp.towson.edu/akumchev/mason/."

The project lies at the interface of physical chemistry, organic chemistry, physics and computer science, and is well suited to the education of scientists at all levels. The Parish laboratory is particularly well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. Undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students will learn to apply rigorous quantum chemical methods to the characterization of important energy-related chemical reactions. The results from these studies will provide fundamental information to support an energy-based economy and directly address important problems in the oil shale industry; namely, the underlying molecular mechanisms for high temperature decomposition and oxidation of the molecular constituents of oil shale and oil sands.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project supports computational investigations of the high temperature decomposition and combustion pathways for molecules found in asphaltenes, as well as to characterize the polyradical intermediates that are produced. Asphaltenes represent an untapped source of hydrocarbon fuel in North America; however, information about the molecular nature of these deposits has only recently become available and very little is known about the reaction pathways, combustion efficiency and reactivity of these species.  In this project, single reference methods are being used to study reaction pathways for 1) combustion and pyrolysis of naphthalenic compounds, 2) electrocyclizations of electron-rich acetylenic moieties that may lead to asphaltene fused aromatic cores and 3) hydrogen transfer processes in octylbenzyne.  Multi-reference methods are being used to study 1) polyradical intermediates produced along those reaction pathways such as naphthalene and alkyl naphthalene radicals and the anthracene diradicals, 2) electron coupling and electronic excitation spectra for heteroaromatic diradicals that will aid in the experimental characterization of these species, 3) linear and divinylsulfane diradicals known to be produced in the pyrolysis of thiophene and 4) reactions involving tetraradicals and the role that through-bond coupling plays in radical electron interaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oxidative damage arises from reactions between DNA and reactive oxygen species that are produced by radiation, chemical carcinogens, or even as part of food consumption.  Oxidative damage is one of the most common types of DNA damage in mammalian cells and can also cause mutations (a change in the information stored in DNA), potentially leading to ageing and various diseases, including cancer. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Michelle Hamm from the University of Richmond, a primarily undergraduate institution, to investigate the chemical basis of mutations caused by oxidatively damaged DNA. The new knowledge generated by the research provides insight into the link between DNA damage and the biological problems that it causes. The research also allows undergraduate students and a post-baccalaureate student to learn chemical and/or biochemical laboratory techniques, as well as other skills that will be useful to them as they pursue graduate or professional school or join the 21st century STEM workforce. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the DNA lesion 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (OdG) and uses structural analogues of OdG or 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) to probe the steric and/or electronic properties that affect the bioactivity of OdG or its 5'-triphosphate analogue, OdGTP. One set of aims focuses on the interaction between OdG or OdGTP and four human translesion polymerases. By comparing polymerase reaction efficiencies of the synthesized analogues to dG/dGTP, OdG/OdGTP, and each other, the exact atomic factors that influence the mutagenic potential of OdG and OdGTP can be isolated. The other main aim of the project includes the use of bacterial incubation and next generation sequencing to better understand OdG mutagenesis and repair in vivo. By comparing the mutation rates of OdG to that of its analogues in various bacterial cell strains, including those that are OdG repair deficient, the important properties and positions within the OdG base that lead to its bacterial mutation rate can be identified.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The students participate in a variety of research projects. Some examples include: the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to formaldehyde, the development of hybrid materials for photovoltaic applications, and the use of molecular dynamics to elucidate the mechanisms of the binding of ubiquitin to its substrate protein. D/HH participants are supported with professional American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters and student interpreters in both professional and social settings. This immersive experience provides interpreting students the opportunity to learn and work in a science environment with the goal of developing professional interpreters with experience in the laboratory. In addition to the full-time student interpreters, additional ASL-interpreting students are invited to campus to observe the REU program for one week. The incorporation of these students expands the impact of the program by exposing a larger number of interpreting students to the challenges and opportunities involved in deaf communication in chemistry laboratories. All REU hearing participants, including faculty and students from outside colleges and universities, benefit from interactions with D/HH students and faculty, as hearing participants gain an appreciation for the challenges and opportunities associated with the inclusion of persons with disabilities.
