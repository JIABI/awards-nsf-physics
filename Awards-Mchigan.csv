Nevertheless, despite a century of investigation, researchers are still making fundamental discoveries in this field ? discoveries which lead to improved device performance, reduced manufacturing cost, or streamlined integration with other technologies. The project activity is based on the unexpected discovery by the research team that the fundamental properties of semiconductor materials stem directly from atomic-scale structural motifs, and not deviations from periodicity as is generally accepted. By shifting that viewpoint, it is possible to achieve a much larger range of parameter values than previously realized. The result is a completely new approach to selecting materials for specific applications. The project also incorporates development of outreach activities for both middle school children and teachers, involving the community directly in the project by investigating how artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques are applied to image recognition and data analysis, thereby helping to ensure a diverse and  motivated pool of young students for careers in science/technology/engineering/math (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>As part of a previous study on how cation disorder changes the band gap energy of the earth abundant element, sustainably-sourced ternary heterovalent semiconductor ZnSnN2, the research team has discovered the unexpected role played by structural motifs in determining this most fundamental of all semiconductor parameters. Carefully designed experiments indicate that it is not only possible to close the band gap of this material through systematic variation of the type and concentration of motifs that make up the lattice, but it is also possible to access ""negative"" band gap energies, corresponding to inverted bands. Further, preliminary evidence indicates that the same effect is possible in other compound semiconductors, including the commercially important InGaN family of materials, again through the action of structural motifs. The project investigates the full range of achievable band gap energies of both of these nitrogen-based material systems using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy based crystal growth in conjunction with a complementary suite of optical absorption, Hall effect and electron and x-ray diffraction techniques, with a view towards understanding the ramifications for charge carrier transport, optical properties, and ultimately material selection choices for devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key focus of traditional statistical theory and modeling for spatial data lies mostly in interpolation and prediction within the study region. Further, the available techniques are restrictive because of many strong assumptions. Besides new ways of modeling spatio-temporal data, this project considers the classification and prediction of spatial objects. The rapid development of information technology is making it possible to collect massive amounts of data in multiple modalities, posing serious challenges to data scientists for multi-tasking the tremendous amount of data in real time. Conventional vector-based statistical modeling is computationally inefficient and inadequate for the classification of spatial objects in complex and high dimensional contexts. This project provides a broader and nonstandard framework for handling such massive spatio-temporal data. The proposed theory and methods are grounded with computer vision applications with low training sample. The project will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project aims at providing two innovative ways of modeling spatio-temporal data, artificial neural networks, and tensor and classifying spatial objects. The techniques are well established in applied machine learning literature but distinguish themselves from the traditional spatio-temporal analysis in statistics. The proposed research builds upon capturing spatio-temporal dependence using machine learning techniques to avoid modeling large covariance matrix and capture complex spatio-temporal dependence. The techniques avoid specifying big covariance matrices to make the models computationally efficient and rely on less distributional assumptions. The proposed mathematical foundations for these methods not only develop new statistical theories, but also eliminate the value loss of these machine learning methods due to lack of adequate mathematical justifications.  Another important feature of this project is that this considers computer vision applications which generally come with low training sample. The popular machine learning techniques such as deep net, neural net, or higher order tensors require large training sample for building effective systems.  A major thrust of this project is to overcome this issue by adopting several dimension reduction techniques that can handle high-dimensional spatio-temporal data with small sample size without overfitting the model. The project will advance research in high dimensional machine learning theory and methods. The theory and methods developed in this project serve a general framework of dealing with large and complex spatio-temporal data and has broader impacts in multidisciplinary fields including statistics, computer science, neuroimaging, machine learning, and data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional machine learning algorithms often lack scalable computational complexity, while modern approaches lack solid mathematical foundations. Moreover, high data dimensionality creates challenges for traditional methods of data analysis. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to combine classic dimension reduction methods with data-driven distances, so that both the distance and embedding procedure are data dependent. This novel approach allows for greater flexibility in balancing the density-based and geometric features of the data, achieves a density-based simplification of geometry, and insightfully represents the data in a small number of dimensions. In contrast to black box methods such as deep learning, the developed methodology can be rigorously analyzed to derive strong theoretical guarantees for several statistical and machine learning tasks. This research will contribute computational tools for cancer immunogenomics and the investigators will consult with the Rogel Cancer Center at the University of Michigan for scientific questions related to tumor immunology and T-cell biology. In addition, new data analysis tools will be made publicly available in an open source software package. <br/><br/>The investigators' approach is driven by the analysis of a family of data-dependent path metrics. These metrics are both density-sensitive and geometry-preserving, with the balance governed by the choice of a single parameter p. By utilizing the space of paths through data, the PIs will obtain density based metrics and embeddings while avoiding the explicit computation of a density estimator, which may be unreliable in a large number of dimensions. The PIs will propose a simple yet highly flexible data model which does not assume the data is sampled from a manifold or collection of manifolds, and investigate the continuous limit of these metrics and an associated graph Laplacian operator. By continuously varying the parameter p, the PIs will propose to create data videos which represent the data from multiple perspectives. The PIs will investigate both multidimensional scaling and graph Laplacian embeddings as mechanisms for obtaining path-based low dimensional representations, and will explore fast algorithms with scalable computational complexity for approximating these metrics. The PIs will contextualize path metrics in the larger frame work of data-driven metrics and focus specifically on the analysis of biological data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among them, developments of medical imaging techniques such as x-ray imaging, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a variety of other radiological imaging techniques have allowed the examination of the internal condition of the body without the use of invasive surgical procedures. Furthermore, medical imaging technologies are being increasingly used to provide guidance for surgery, biopsy, and radiation therapy in real-time. We are now on the cusp of another breakthrough era, given the availability of data, computational power, and novel computing methodology such as artificial intelligence, thereby potentially elevating human healthcare to a level never seen before. Mathematics, particularly, computational and applied mathematics, plays a foundational role in the projected advancement. <br/><br/>The primary focus of the proposed interdisciplinary symposium is to provide an update on recent important contributions to computational and numerical methods in biomedical problems. Applying novel mathematics and modeling techniques to extract new or additional information from complex bio-medical datasets are particularly encouraged. Topics of interest include mathematical and computing methods and their immediate applications in the following areas: a) Novel mathematical image formation/reconstruction/processing methods and their applications in biomedical problems; b)Novel mathematical algorithms enabling multi-scale and multi-physics simulation related to biomedical problems;c) Scientific visualization and analytics of  (BIG) biomedical data; d) Novel machine learning and statistical analysis methods and their application in (BIG) biomedical data. One of the main challenges when integrating mathematics into biomedical sciences is overcoming existing barriers. Unfamiliarity with biomedical language, distinct disciplinary-bound approaches to research in the mathematics community, and 'artificial' academic boundaries aimed at 'preserving subject integrity' can hinder developments in this line of interdisciplinary research. The secondary objective of this symposium is to provide a platform so that intelligent exchanges among applied mathematicians, biomedical engineers, and clinical scientists can take place, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. A concerted effort will be made to include underrepresented students and early and middle-career mathematicians in the symposium. Using existing resources available at the Michigan Technological University, the organizers will work together with the Center of Diversity and Inclusion and other partners to recruit students who are typically from economically-disadvantageous backgrounds to attend this symposium. In addition, it is planned to create a future network of support and interaction among participants to enable further research and collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The materials within the cell are separated and protected from the environment by the cell membrane that is composed of molecules derived from fatty acids.  These molecules function well under relatively benign natural conditions, such as in water at room temperature and pressure. Under harsh environments, such as extreme temperatures and pressures prevalent in industrial processes, these molecules are unstable therefore making it difficult to deploy cells within such environments.  Furthermore, it is difficult to engineer natural membrane molecules with new functions such as the ability to sense their environment or bind particular surfaces or target molecules.  It is the primary goal of this work to discover and synthesize a new class of molecules based on proteins as an alternative 'chassis' material for synthetic cell membranes that have improved mechanical and chemical stability and can be engineered to endow the membrane with new functions.  Profs. Ferguson and Liu combine fast experimental synthesis and testing with computer simulations and artificial intelligence tools to search for new synthetic membranes with the ability to survive in harsh environments and the capacity to assemble synthetic cells together into synthetic tissues.  By combining experiment and computation within a virtuous cycle, wherein computation guides experiment and experiment informs computational modeling, massive savings in labor, time, and resources are realized compared to traditional trial-and-improvement experimentation.  In the course of this work, Profs. Ferguson and Liu provide research opportunities for post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high-school trainees, incorporate the outcomes of the research into classes that they teach, and engage in outreach activities through a Girls in Science and Engineering summer camp, Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, and University of Chicago After School Matters summer internship program.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The aim of this work is to discover novel peptidic biomaterials as an alternative ""chassis"" material for synthetic cells.  While biology has settled on using lipid bilayer membrane as the material for compartmentalizing cytoplasm and for membrane-bound organelles, polypeptides offer an alternative biomaterial that can establish peptidic microcompartments with improved mechanical and chemical stability and the capacity for additional engineered biological function.  Peptidic chassis materials offer unique advantages compared to lipid and polymersome membrane materials in terms of biocompatibility, chemical and mechanical stability, and capacity for additional functionalization that make them extremely desirable for applications in biomedicine, drug delivery, biosensing, and deployment in non-natural environments.  The discovery of peptide sequences capable of spontaneous self-assembly into solute-filled microcompartments with desired materials properties is frustrated by the vast size of the protein sequence search space that makes exhaustive exploration intractable and Edisonian trial-and-improvement inefficient.  In this work, we establish an integrated data-driven modeling and high-throughput cell-free synthesis platform to rapidly traverse sequence space.  In a tightly integrated feedback loop between theory and modeling, we employ an 'active learning' paradigm to extract information from experimental data, guide rational traversal of the vast peptide sequence space, and optimally deploy experimental resources.  Completion of this work will lead to the discovery of highly sought-after peptide-based synthetic cell 'chassis materials' that are more robust to harsh environments and which have complementary binding functionality to enable self-organization of the synthetic cells into synthetic tissues.  In the course of this work, Profs. Ferguson and Liu offer research opportunities for high-school and undergraduate students to provide exposure to scientific research and improve representation in the STEM pipeline, train graduate and post-doctoral trainees in integrated computational and experimental research, incorporate the scientific outcomes in course materials, and engage in outreach activities through a Girls in Science and Engineering summer camp, Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, and University of Chicago After School Matters summer internship program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The catalysts that Professor Odom and his research group are studying are complexes of titanium and vanadium, which are early transition metals that are earth abundant and offer unique chemical products. This more sustainable reactivity model will minimize the time and effort required for the optimization of catalytic systems that are commonly used in industry. While similar studies have been performed for late transition metal catalysts that are used for different types of applications, this model has been designed for early transition metal catalysts. These studies are advancing an initial model previously developed by Professor Odom to be able to function with a larger number of reaction variables and different types of catalyst-substrate interactions. The program is also discovering new ways to adapt the model to catalysts that are attached to solid supports. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students are being trained through their participation in these activities and a chemical demonstration team is being organized to engage local K-12 students in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Ligand parametrization methods have recently been established as valuable tools for catalyst optimization with late transition metal systems. Although early transition metal catalysts are used in a variety of industrial processes for the conversion of petrochemical products to value-added commodities, catalytic performance predictive methods have been slower to evolve in this area. The Odom laboratory has developed the first model to systematize the factors that control the reactivity of titanium-catalysts used for hydroamination. These researchers are now advancing their working model to be able to handle new challenges such as non-symmetrical ligand systems and multicomponent reactions.  In addition, the method is being designed to accommodate silica-supported titanium catalysts and vanadium olefin isomerization catalysts that require consideration of new types of catalyst-substrate interactions.

In recent years, researchers have made remarkable progress in our fundamental understanding of the complex and fascinating system that is the nucleus. This progress has been driven by new theoretical insights, increased computational power, and experimental access to new exotic isotopes with a large excess of neutrons or protons. As the frontiers of experimental nuclear physics increasingly move towards the study of exotic nuclei, there is an urgent need for theorists to develop controlled, ab-initio (i.e., ?first principles? or microscopic) many-body theories of the nucleus. This is because time honored phenomenological models of nuclear theory, such as the nuclear shell model and mean-field/density functional theory, are ?data driven? approaches that require the presence of nearby data to fix parameters. The exploration of previously uncharted regions of the nuclear landscape therefore poses severe challenges for such models.<br/><br/>To address these challenges, the present NSF award will work to develop new ab-initio or microscopic many-body theories and methods that are capable of reaching medium-mass nuclei and beyond. Such approaches start directly from the fundamental forces between nucleons and attempt to solve the quantum many-body equations of motion without introducing additional parameters that need to be fit to the nuclei of interest. This is computationally much more challenging than the phenomenological approaches, and requires significant computational and conceptual advances to cover the same regions of nuclei.  Under the present award, the team will develop a nuclear many-body modeling infrastructure based on state-of-the-art  Coupled-Cluster (CC) Theory and In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG) methods, leveraged to exploit powerful techniques and algorithms from the fields of Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Computing. The goal is to develop a comprehensive framework that is capable of providing controlled and predictive calculations for static and dynamic properties over a wide range of conditions, from nuclei to dense matter and neutron stars. These activities will be closely linked with ongoing experimental programs in low-energy nuclear physics nationally and worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are indispensable in the core data-driven technologies responsible for advancing a vast array of domains of engineering and sciences. While these tools represent remarkable achievements in which statisticians have played fundamental and decisive roles, there are urgent and formidable challenges lying ahead. As these tools are increasingly applied to ever bigger data sets and systems, there are deep concerns that they may no longer be understood, nor is their construction and deployment reliable or robust.  When treated as merely black-box modeling devices for fitting densities and curves, latent variable models are difficult to interpret and can be hard to detect or fix when something goes wrong, either when the model is severely misspecified or the learning algorithms simply break down. This project  aims to address the theoretical and computational issues that arise in modern latent variable models, and the learning efficiency and interpretability of such statistical models when they are misspecified.<br/><br/><br/>The goals of this project are to develop new methods, algorithms and theory for latent variable models. There are three major aims: (1) a statistical theory for parameter estimation that arises in latent variable models;  (2) scalable parameter learning algorithms which account for the geometry of the latent structures, as well as the geometry of the data representation arising from specific application domains; and (3) impacts of model misspecification on parameter estimation motivating the development of new methods. These three broadly described aims are partly motivated by the PI's collaborative efforts with scientists and engineers in several data-driven domains, namely intelligent transportation, astrophysics and topic modeling for information extraction. In all these domains, latent variable models are favored as an effective approximation device, but practitioners are interested in not only predictive performance but also interpretability. In terms of methods and tools, this research draws from and contributes to several related areas including statistical learning, nonparametric Bayesian statistics and non-convex optimization. In terms of broader impacts, the development of scalable geometric and variational inference algorithms for latent variable models will help to expand the statistical and computational tool box that are indispensable in the analysis of complex and big data. The investigation into the geometry of singularity structures and the role of optimal transport based theory in the analysis of models and the development of algorithms will help to accelerate the cross-fertilization between statistics and mathematics, computer science and operations research. In terms of education and training, the interdisciplinary nature of this project provides an exciting opportunity to attract and train a generation of researchers and students in variational methods and optimization, statistics and mathematics, as well as machine learning and intelligent infrastructure.  The materials developed in this project will be integrated into an undergraduate honor course and a summer school for statistical science and big data analytics developed at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While sometimes it is possible to derive mathematical models that describe the evolution of a dynamical system, these models are almost always an abstraction of the physical system and, therefore, have a limited ability to predict how the system will change in time.  Further, when the system under investigation is large or too complicated with several factors influencing its behavior, it may simply be impossible to describe the system with the corresponding descriptive equations.  Consequently, in the absence of adequate analytical models it becomes necessary to instrument the dynamical system with sensors and use the resulting data to understand its characteristics.  Specifically, the change in the state of a dynamic system is often governed by an underlying skeleton that gives the overall behavior a shape, and thus the shape of the skeleton directly governs the system behavior.  Most of the time, this shape of the underlying skeleton is unknown and can be easily masked by the complicated and rich system signals.  The emergent field of topological data analysis (TDA), a branch of mathematics that quantifies the shape of data, is capable of revealing information that is invisible to other existing methods by providing a high level X-ray of the skeleton governing the dynamics.  However, the information-rich structures provided by TDA still need to be interpreted in order to classify the dynamics and predict future outcomes.  To accomplish this, the principal investigators will leverage ideas from machine learning, a field of study that investigates algorithms that can learn from the data and use the acquired knowledge for classification and prediction.  However, the mathematical theory that elucidates how machine learning can operate on the features extracted using TDA currently does not exist.  Hence, this work will develop the necessary, novel mathematical and computational tools at the intersection of topological data analysis (TDA), dynamical systems, and machine learning.<br/><br/>The principal investigators seek to understand and formulate the foundations of machine learning when the important features of a dynamical system are summarized by descriptors generated with topological data analysis (TDA).  Although these signatures provide an information-rich structure for the evolution of the dynamics, current literature has only been utilizing a fraction of the available information in order to identify, predict, and classify different dynamic behavior.  One of the current impediments to further exploring the relationship between TDA and dynamical systems is the lack of machine learning theory that can operate on these structures. Therefore, the success of our effort will lead to (1) the establishment of a novel, general, and robust machine learning framework for studying dynamic signals via topological signatures, (2) better understanding of the relationship between TDA and dynamical systems via the use of these methods on real and synthetic data, and (3) the integration of the new knowledge into the investigators' educational programs, which will provide timely training of well-equipped next generation scientists and engineers."

The resulting patterns resemble a labyrinth of streets in a metropolitan area, although they are approximately one-hundred million times smaller and in three dimensions, called crystals.  The structures of the as solidified crystals arranged in the pattern closely relate to the properties of the material, even after subsequent processing steps.  To our advantage, the shapes and sizes of these crystals can be tailored to meet technological demands by manipulating the chemical composition of the parent liquid phase.  For instance, trace metal impurities dissolved in the liquid are known to transform solid silicon (Si) from coarse, blocky particles into fine, web-like fibers.  This results in a dramatic enhancement of the strength and ductility of the Si-based alloy and expands its potential for new applications, including space-frames and electric vehicles. The objective of this CAREER award is to understand how and why such transformations occur in the presence of trace metal impurities, by harnessing one of the brightest sources of hard X rays in the world at Argonne National Laboratory.  The incident X-radiation can penetrate through an otherwise opaque metal, allowing one to capture the details of solidification in real time.  Following the experiments, the PI and his team will extract information from the time lapse videos of solidification using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.  It is anticipated that their new vision will advance the field of alloy solidification from metallurgical alchemy to predictive science.  Ultimately, understanding the evolution of solid patterns during synthesis is the key to controlling the manufacture of advanced materials from the bottom-up.  The new discoveries generated by this program will be integrated into problem-based learning units for underrepresented middle school students, in partnership with the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP).  The PI will assess the impact of these activities using annual and multi-year surveys distributed through the DAPCEP organization.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>In the past 50 years, there has been increasing interest - both fundamental and applied - in the process of solidification in multicomponent metal alloys.  One longstanding problem concerns microstructure formation in eutectic alloy systems.  While binary eutectics with non faceted interfaces are relatively well understood, comparatively little is known about the solidification behavior of eutectics with faceted interfaces and/or more than two components.  Such is the case for Al-Si eutectics that are solidified in the presence of trace metal species (so called chemical modifiers).  The higher degrees of freedom in the univariate reaction (i.e., three components and two solid phases) brings about morphological transitions not seen in nonvariant eutectics.  For instance, the chemical modifiers transform the morphology of the Si phase from coarse flakes to fine fibers, thereby improving the mechanical properties of the cast alloy.  Despite our technical experience with chemical modification, the underlying mechanisms by which the trace metal species influences the solidification pathway have not yet been satisfactorily explained.  To this end, the PI and his team will develop a combined experimental computational research program that will focus on eutectic nucleation in chemically-modified alloys.  Building on his track record in real-time imaging, he will harness the new capabilities in ""fast"" X-ray tomography to watch the solidification of Al-Si eutectics doped with various modifier species and concentrations.  Given the volume of data to be collected in such experiments (tens of TB), it is impossible to process the data manually.  Instead, the PI and his team will implement state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (convolutional neural networks) to extract information from the large datasets, including details on the nucleation density, rate, and undercooling.

This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent years have witnessed many non-standard data regimes that impose unprecedented challenges for representation learning. The first scenario is that data are decentralized, that is, they are scattered across different places across which the communication is highly restricted. This is common for international companies that collect data worldwide, but cannot aggregate them due to constraints on network bandwidth or legal policies. The second scenario is that data exhibit significant temporal dependence, as seen in stock prices, traffic flow, and clinical trials. This project will develop novel statistical methods with theoretical guarantees to handle these modern data regimes. It also aims to train the next generation of data scientists under these important problem setups. <br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) will develop novel methods and theory for subspace and representation learning for decentralized and dependent data. For decentralized data, the PI plans to design and study a new methodological framework for distributed estimation of a general latent variable model. This framework requires only one round of communication of model parameters, adapts to a wide range of complex latent variable models (including those based on deep neural nets) and has been shown to yield superior numerical performance over existing approaches. Another more specific setup that the PI will consider is distributed estimation of singular spaces, with applications to spectral clustering. For dependent data, the PI will focus on learning the top singular space of a low-rank Markov transition kernel to perform state compression and dimension reduction.

Alloying elements called 'solutes' in metallic materials can exist in different forms, or phases. The solutes are in solid solution phases if they are randomly distributed in alloys as individual atoms; they can also be in certain small particles or 'precipitate' phases if some solutes agglomerate together to form specific structures through typical nucleation and growth progresses. Mechanical properties of alloys depend on the phases of solutes. Generally, alloys in solid solution phases are soft and ductile, convenient for low-cost mechanical forming and fabrication; but alloys with certain precipitate phases can be much harder and, therefore, difficult for mechanical forming compared with their counterparts in solid solution phases, so they are usually achieved in alloy components at final product stages.  <br/><br/>7000 series aluminum alloys with zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg) as the major alloying elements have a high strength-to-weight ratio after proper precipitation hardening (similar strength but half of the weight compared with conventional steel). Their widespread implementation in the automotive industry as structural components can achieve vehicles with lightweight and high fuel efficiency. However, the solute solution phases in these alloys can quickly (~30 minutes) transform into precipitate phases to harden the alloys even at room temperature, making significant challenges of their low-cost forming and fabrication using current automobile manufacturing techniques. <br/><br/>This University of Michigan-General Motors collaborative GOALI project aims to apply an integrated computational, experimental and statistical approach to understand and control the early stages of solid-solution-to-precipitate transformation kinetics of 7000 series aluminum alloys. The key objective is to design new alloy chemistries to retard the nucleation and growth of early-stage precipitate phases at room temperatures. These early-stage precipitates are mainly solute clusters and Guinier-Preston (GP) zones, both of which are made of a small number (less than 1000) of solute atoms agglomerated together. Then these alloys can stay in soft solid-solution phases for a longer time, convenient for conventional automobile manufacturing techniques. In addition, the new alloy chemistries should not impede the final precipitation hardening at a higher temperature. The proposed research will potentially enable implementation of 7000 series aluminum alloys in the automobile industry, contributing to vehicle light-weighting and favorably impacting energy savings, sustainability, and competitiveness. The generated computational-experimental-statistical framework and new knowledge will be applicable to alloy design in general and thus accelerate material development for meeting future needs. The proposed teaching and training elements will enable an integrated-computational-materials-engineering (ICME) approach to be widely imparted to senior undergraduate and graduate students in materials major and champion outreach/education activities of K-12 students as well as opportunities for students of underrepresented groups to be engaged in start-of-the-art materials research.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>Nucleation and growth theories of precipitates in solids are key fundamental principles to guide the development and application of advanced age-hardenable structural alloys. However, the conventional theories fail to provide quantitative guidance for the development and processing of multicomponent commercial alloys, where nucleation and growth of precipitates can occur in multiple steps with substantial structural-composition transformations under the influence of defects. This gap between theory and practice limits the industrial applications of many commercial alloys that require special fabrication and manufacturing processes. For example, high-strength Al-Zn-Mg-based 7000 series alloys have severe formability limitations if stamped more than ~30 minutes after the solutionizing treatment. These limitations result from fast precipitate kinetics at room temperature ('natural aging'), mainly the nucleation and growth of solute clusters and Guinier-Preston (GP) zones that can act as nuclei for subsequent precipitates. Understanding and controlling these nucleation and growth processes can slow down natural aging, and thereby expand the room temperature forming window amenable to the sustainable manufacturing of 7000 series Al alloys and other lightweight high-strength materials in the automobile industry, which has a significant impact on vehicle mass reduction.<br/><br/>In this industry-university collaborative GOALI project, the applicants plan to apply an integrated theoretical, computational, experimental and machine learning approach to understand and control the nucleation and growth kinetics of solute clusters and GP zones in Al-Zn-Mg-based alloys. A multi-scale simulation framework based on first-principles calculations, atomistic simulations, and phenomenological hardening model will be constructed to quantitatively describe the solute clusters and GP zone kinetics and their effects on hardness increments. Alloys with the proposed solutes will be synthesized and subjected to thermal processing and indentation hardness tests to verify their natural aging kinetics. A combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy and computer image simulations will be used to characterize the solute clusters and fine precipitates to verify the nucleation and growth mechanisms. A statistical machine learning surrogate model will be constructed to speed up the search of alloy chemistries to retard natural aging with further experimental confirmations. <br/><br/>In this project, the research team proposes a transformative alloy design concept to tune the early-stage precipitation kinetics of complex commercial alloys by searching the trace solute elements to control the structures and compositions of solid clusters and GP zones beyond the role of individual atoms of trace solute elements. The research team also proposes an efficient routine to design advanced alloys with a large parameter space by applying the integrated computational, experimental and statistical machine learning methods.  Quantitative understanding of precipitate nucleation and growth kinetics in 7000 series Al alloys using the newly developing computational and experimental tools will facilitate the development of advanced nucleation and growth theories for generalized multicomponent alloy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atoms in metals and alloys are arranged in crystal structures with almost perfect periodic patterns, but these structures still contain a small number of imperfections or ""defects"", variations from perfect periodicity. Many mechanical and physical properties depend on how defects are generated and move under the influences of alloying elements, or solutes, in crystal structures. For example, the strength and ductility of metals and alloys are usually controlled by a type of defect called dislocations, and some solute atoms can slow down or speed up dislocation motions to make alloys stronger and more brittle, or softer and more ductile. <br/><br/>This project will focus on defects in advanced alloys based on certain transition-metal elements, such as tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. These alloys can have excellent mechanical properties at high temperatures and are critical for many energy, transport, and aerospace applications, such as structural components of nuclear reactors, turbine engines and electric generators. To develop these advanced alloys with enhanced performance would require the understanding of solute effects on defect behaviors and the corresponding variations of mechanical properties.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop and apply computational methods to predict how solute atoms affect the stability and motion mechanisms of defects in advanced transition-metal alloys.

Interactions between solute atoms and crystalline defects, including dislocations, and twin and grain boundaries, play essential roles in determining the mechanical and physical properties of many advanced alloys. First-principles theory is ideal for investigating such interactions. However, first-principles calculations are limited by increasing computational intensity with system size, making it difficult to predict the solute and impurity effects on the stability and mobility of defects involving complex atomistic structures, such as dislocation kinks, twin nuclei, and grain boundary complexions.<br/><br/>Recently, the PI discovered a series of strong correlations between defect energetics and local electronic structures in several types of advanced transition metal alloys. These new findings suggest a path to predict accurately complex defect-solute interactions by understanding chemical bonding mechanisms at the electronic level. Based on this approach, the PI aims to: (i) identify generalized and quantitative correlations between local electronic/atomistic structures and defect-solute interactions for multiple types of defects and solutes based on chemical bonding models, first-principles calculations and machine learning methods, (ii) apply the above correlations to construct mesoscale simulation methods and phenomenological models to predict the solute/impurities effects on defect stability and mobility, and (iii) employ the above methods and models to evaluate the mechanical behavior, such as solid-solution hardening/softening, twinability, and grain boundary embrittlement. <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to advance fundamental understanding of the intrinsic physical mechanisms of defect-solute interactions that are critical for advanced transition metal alloys to achieve excellent mechanical performance under varying environmental conditions. It will explore the application of machine learning methods for alloy design based on physical models at electronic and atomistic levels. The investigated defect structures will be incorporated into the virtual reality tools to enhance the undergraduates' understanding of lattice and chemical defects and their effects on materials properties; the generated data and computational tools will be applied in education modules to help graduate students to learn the state-of-the-art materials design approaches. These data and tools will also be utilized in outreach education and research activities for K-12 students with diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems arise in different areas of science and engineering, including massive data analysis, machine learning, signal processing, medical image reconstruction, statistics, traffic and logistical networks, and operations research. Most of them share the irregular phenomenon of nonsmoothness or nonconvexity that challenges computation. Despite several practically successful algorithms recently proposed to solve such problems, the underlying fundamental theory is not quite understood and explored. Only analyzing the complexity and the deep mathematics behind these problems and algorithms provides practitioners across related, vital science and engineering areas new tools to comprehend their core features, be able to design more efficient algorithms, and attack more challenging problems arising from practice. The investigators develop such tools via a novel approach from a relatively young subfield of applied mathematics, variational analysis, which is naturally compatible with these nonsmooth and complex structures. Several topics from this project are integrated with teaching topic courses and training of students.<br/><br/>This project is devoted to developing the theory of second-order variational analysis (SOVA) and using it to study the stability, sensitivity, and computational complexity of algorithms for solving structured optimization problems. The first part of this project serves as the theoretical foundation; it concerns the theory of SOVA with connections to stability and sensitivity analysis. More specifically, the investigators intend to study: (i) tilt stability and full stability for general optimization problems with connections to Robinson's strong regularity and Kojima's strong stability for conic programming via SOVA; (ii) metric (sub)regularity of the subdifferential and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property on nonsmooth (possibly nonconvex) functions via SOVA; and (iii) stability for parametric variational systems including Nash equilibrium systems and variational inequalities via SOVA. The second part of this project consists of designing and analyzing proximal algorithms for solving convex and nonconvex structured problems. Immediate applications include Lasso, group Lasso, elastic net, basic pursuit, sparsity, low-rank problems, and completion matrix problems that originate from compressed sensing, image reconstruction, machine learning, and data science. Stability theory developed in the first part plays a significant role here, especially in the complexity analysis of these algorithms. It explains why the development of many recent proximal algorithms is strongly influenced by the hidden power of SOVA. The specific objectives of this part are: (i) to accelerate the forward-backward splitting method and analyze the phenomenon of linear convergence encountered frequently in numerical experiments; and (ii) to design efficient methods of Douglas-Rachford splitting type for solving nonconvex optimization and feasibility problems. Other important applications include inverse problems corrupted by Poisson noise and total variation denoising models, both of which are well recognized in imaging science and statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum chemistry calculations of molecular energies is such an example. Indeed, computing the energy of a molecule, given the charges and positions of its nuclei, is a central issue in computational chemistry with important applications in molecular dynamics, materials science, and drug discovery. Machine learning algorithms do not simulate the physical system but estimate solutions by learning from a training set of known examples. However, such learning algorithms may require a number of examples that is exponential in the system dimension, and are thus intractable; this phenomena is referred to as the ""curse of dimensionality."" This proposal will develop a novel approach for the estimation of molecular energies based on the ""scattering transform."" The scattering transform estimates molecular energies, and circumvents the curse of dimensionality, by utilizing a multiscale, multilevel architecture that takes advantage of physical invariants. The resulting algorithms have the potential to significantly speed up the computation of highly accurate molecular energy estimates, leading to large scale atomistic simulations with greatly improved accuracy, speed, and adaptability, thus shifting the paradigm of multiscale modeling. The PI will additionally mentor an undergraduate student and train a graduate student in this field, thus setting up the potential for dissemination of the core ideas to a broader audience.<br/><br/>The scattering transform has the structure of a deep convolutional network, but is composed of iterated wavelet transforms and complex modulus operators. Such networks have been used in computer vision for the analysis and classification of two dimensional images and audio tasks involving one dimensional signals. A multiscale three dimensional scattering transform network is novel both in practice (multiscale 3D) and design (for quantum chemistry), and has the chance to influence these types of architectures moving forward. A systematic approach will attack the primary object on several fronts: (1) development of efficient 3D filters with the appropriate symmetry and stability properties; (2) rigorous error analysis of the scattering regression algorithm for various components of the molecular energy functional; (3) deeper understanding of the scattering network via provable relations with fast multipole methods. The methods used to carry out these objectives will include: (i) wavelet filter design and efficient signal processing algorithms; (ii) utilization of Littlewood-Paley Theory in conjunction with polynomial (Taylor) approximation theory; (iii) multiscale analysis; (iv) numerical experiments to validate methods. By rigorously linking deep learning architectures with physical chemistry, the research in this proposal will take place at the interface of data science and scientific computation, for the mutual gain of both."

Although models describing how the microstructure evolves, for example during heat treatment, have been available, their efficient numerical simulation at scales large enough to be of practical interest to materials scientists have remained a challenge. The project will address this challenge. Understanding the evolution of microstructure holds the promise of materials with more desirable characteristics.

For certain important interfacial phenomena, such as grain boundary motion, the evolution is given by second order differential equations describing motion by mean curvature of the network. For that setting, a surprisingly simple, elegant, and efficient class of algorithms known as threshold dynamics have been developed that makes large scale simulation particularly feasible. Other phenomena, such as the motion of the free surface of a thin polycrystalline film, or that of pores in a sintered metal, are described by higher order geometric evolutions, such as motion by surface diffusion, and are more challenging to simulate. This project will develop efficient algorithms for such high order multi-phase geometric evolutions. In particular, it will explore whether threshold dynamics or a combination of it with phase field methods can be devised to simulate the motion of networks of surfaces in which some of the interfaces evolve via motion by mean curvature, and others via motion by surface diffusion, coupled along free boundaries known as junctions along which appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied. Some of these models describing the multi-phase geometric motion of networks of interfaces also arise almost verbatim in the context of computer vision and machine learning.

Intriguingly, nano-crystalline metals, which are made of tiny nanometer-sized crystallites packed tightly together, exhibits superior strength and improved durability.  Within each crystallite, the metal atoms are arranged in a highly orderly manner. However, as the crystallites can have various spatial orientations with respect to each other, the atoms near the boundaries between neighboring crystallites are no longer well aligned and are viewed as defects. These defects play a decisive role in the enhanced mechanical strength.  Thus, to understand how these defects improve the mechanical strength, the PI and his team will use synchrotron X-ray sources available at the Argonne National Laboratory complemented with advanced atomistic modeling techniques developed by the PI in order to determine the motion of these atoms near these defects during deformation under various stresses, temperatures, and rates of mechanical deformation.  Such insights will be used to advance predictive theory of the nano-crystallite metals? time-dependent and environment-sensitive mechanical performances. The outcome of this research will also be leveraged into classroom instruction using a virtual reality (VR)-assisted teaching innovation. In addition, this project aims for broader impacts by outreaching to a variety of platforms to mentor the next generation workforce in STEM, inspire under-resourced K-12 students and potential future engineers with diverse backgrounds, and engage the public and increase their awareness of material science.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>Understanding the behavior of metastable grain boundaries at complex environments is crucial to develop cost-effective and high-performance nanocrystalline alloys demanded in advanced energy, transportation, and defense applications. The primary objective of this project is to establish a fundamental basis to describe the structural and metastability evolution of grain boundaries at extreme conditions, and to use this basis to explain and predict the grain boundary-mediated deformation and the resultant mechanical properties of nanocrystalline alloys taking place under non-equilibrium processing. The project will combine advanced atomistic sampling techniques, potential energy landscape theory, and machine learning tool to: (i) obtain the ensemble of elementary structural rearrangements and associated activation energy spectra in disordered atomic packing environments by inducing location-specific perturbations; (ii) enable an automated detection of kernel atoms prone to plastic deformation through the non-affine displacement field analysis using a random sample consensus machine learning algorithm; (iii) establish a self-consistent kinetic theory to construct the connectivity between grain boundaries? various metastable states in the potential energy landscape and to predict the evolution of time-dependent metastability; and, (iv) discover the interaction mechanisms between metastable grain boundaries and pinning dislocations across multiple timescales using potential energy landscape-assisted novel atomistic modeling protocol. This project will also carry out designed hypothesis-driven experiments, including X-ray diffraction, sub-ablation femtosecond laser pulses, and nano-indentation, to validate the modeling and theoretical predictions. The proposed research will directly link the atomic level processes (e.g., short-range atomic rearrangements and non-affine atomic displacement) inside the grain boundaries with the macroscopic behavior of nanocrystalline alloys, which may facilitate exploiting new design/processing space of nanocrystalline alloys, identifying optimized routes to access novel states with enhanced performance and durability under complex environments.<br/><br/>The research program will be integrated with educational innovations and outreach activities, including: (i) utilizing virtual reality and other advanced techniques in the developed new course on the subject of grain boundaries and other defects in structural materials; (ii) mentoring the next generation workforce in STEM fields by participating in Summer Schools both at the University of Michigan and at National Laboratories; (iii) outreaching to under-resourced K-12 students and potential future engineers with diverse background through various platforms, and sharing the PI?s research and career path to inform and inspire them and to promote higher education; and, (iv) exploring the attractive venues such as museums to engage the public and increase their awareness of materials science.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded through the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures and Condensed Matter and Materials Theory programs in the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pharmaceutical drugs are mostly made up of very small molecules, which take their effect by binding to target biomolecules in our bodies and perturbing their functions. A major challenge in designing new drugs - such as treatments for cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease - is figuring out how to bind a particular target both accurately (with little off-target binding), and effectively (a high percentage of targets occupied by drug molecules). A key quantity to maximize the effectiveness of a drug is its ""residence time,"" the average amount of time the drug will remain in the binding site after each binding event. However, little is known about how the structure of a drug molecule determines its residence time, and this hinders our ability to incorporate residence time predictions in the drug design process.  This research will predict the residence times of compounds binding to a pharmaceutical target molecule that affects diabetic neuropathic pain, as well as test those predictions experimentally.  This study will potentially result in new treatments for diabetic neuropathic pain and also serve as a blueprint for future drug discovery efforts focused on residence time.  To facilitate adoption of this approach the team of investigators will disseminate their results via a dedicated website, online servers and participation in world-wide competitions for predicting drug binding properties. This project also involves the training of graduate students with unique interdisciplinary backgrounds, and will inform the development of graduate courses at the intersection of mathematics and biological sciences. <br/><br/>This project will develop a pipeline of mathematical and computational tools to enable kinetics-based drug discovery. The studies will be conducted on soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), an established pharmaceutical target for diabetic neuropathic pain for which only limited drugs have yet been approved. This project will use an integrated approach that encompasses topological modeling, machine learning, virtual screening, molecular simulation, as well as in vitro and in vivo assessment of compound efficacy. In PI Wei's laboratory, persistent homology will be used together with deep learning to abstract topological information from protein-ligand complexes and predict stable binding poses, binding affinities, and binding kinetics.  It is believed that the combination of topological analysis and deep learning will be transformative: it will bring a surge in similar approaches in 3D biomolecular data predictions in the near future, as well as applications to other fields, such as chemistry, and material science.  PI Dickson will use rare-event techniques in molecular modeling to simulate ligand release events, and identify the rate-limiting transition states of the ligand binding and release process. This project will also examine the robustness of ligand binding transition states for the first time, which is the key quantity to enable kinetics-based drug design.  Thirdly, PI Lee will continually assess the binding affinity and residence times of the predicted compounds. Selected compounds will be tested in vivo with a novel mouse model, to determine the limits of the benefits of long in vitro residence times. This collaborative project will achieve synergistic benefits by bringing together expertise from advanced mathematics, computational biophysics, and molecular pharmacology. The collaborative tools for sampling and prediction resulting from this work can then be applied to the discovery of novel long residence time compounds for other targets of interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary focus of the conference is to educate and inspire researchers and students in new and innovative numerical techniques for the parallel-in-time solution of large-scale evolution problems on modern supercomputing architectures, and to stimulate further studies in their analysis and applications. It aligns with the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) objective: ""increase coherence between technology for modeling/simulation and data analytics"". Computational simulations are a key part of scientific research for government, industry, and academia, complementing laboratory experimentation and theory. Changes in computer architectures are leading to future supercomputers that will have billions of processors, as opposed to millions today. However, each individual processor will be no faster than individual processors today. Thus, these next generation machines will no longer automatically provide a speedup to existing computational simulations, and new mathematical algorithms must be developed and deployed that can utilize this unprecedented number of processors. Parallel-in-time methods provide one such class of mathematical algorithms. They add a new dimension (time) of parallelism and thus allow existing computer models to be extended to next generation supercomputers. The range of potential applications is vast: computational molecular dynamics such as protein and DNA folding, computational biology (e.g., heart modeling), computational fluid dynamics (e.g., combustion, climate, and weather), and machine learning.<br/><br/>The conference will feature ten lectures by Professor Gander, an expert in parallel time integration. Using appropriate mathematical methodologies from the theory of partial differential equations in a functional analytic setting, numerical discretizations, integration techniques, and convergence analyses of these iterative methods, conference participants will be exposed to the numerical analysis of parallel-in-time methodologies and their implementations. The proposed topics include multiple shooting type methods, waveform relaxation methods, time-multigrid methods, and direct time-parallel methods.

Utilizing modern supercomputers to run models and simulations allows for experimentation in virtual laboratories, thus saving both time and resources. Although the next generation of supercomputers will contain an unprecedented number of processors, this will not automatically increase the speed of running simulations. New mathematical algorithms are needed that can fully harness the processing potential of these new systems. Parallel-in-time methods, the subject of this workshop, are timely and necessary, as they extend existing computer models to these next generation machines by adding a new dimension of scalability. Thus, the use of parallel-in-time methods will provide dramatically faster simulations in many important areas, such as biomedical applications (e.g., heart modeling), computational fluid dynamics (e.g., aerodynamics and weather prediction), and machine learning. Computational and applied mathematics plays a foundational role in this projected advancement. <br/><br/>The primary focus of the  parallel-in-time workshop is to disseminate cutting-edge research and facilitate scientific discussions on the field of parallel time integration methods. This workshop aligns with the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NCSI) objective: 'increase coherence between technology for modeling/simulation and data analytics'.  The need for parallel time integration is being driven by microprocessor trends, where future speedups for computational simulations will come through using increasing numbers of cores and not through faster clock speeds. Thus as spatial parallelism techniques saturate, parallelization in the time direction offers the best avenue for leveraging next generation supercomputers with billions of processors. Regarding the mathematical treatment of parallel time integrators, one must use advanced methodologies from the theory of partial differential equations in a functional analytic setting, numerical discretization and integration, convergence analyses of iterative methods, and the development and implementation of new parallel algorithms. Thus, the workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group of experts spanning these areas.

Scientists in a variety of disciplines today have unprecedented access to massive spatial and temporal databases comprising high resolution remote sensed measurements. Statistical modeling and analysis for such data often entail reckoning with spatial associations and variations at multiple levels while attempting to recognize underlying patterns and potentially complex relationships among the scientific variables. Traditional statistical hypothesis testing is no longer adequate for these inferential objectives and statisticians are increasingly turning to multi-level or hierarchical modeling structures for analyzing complex spatial-temporal data. However, there continue to remain substantial computational bottlenecks as scientists encounter the data deluge in remote-sensed data that demand specialized ""BIG DATA"" technologies. The PIs will address these problems by developing probabilistic machine learning tools for spatial-temporal BIG DATA within the context of scientific advancements in forest structure, topography, and weather-related events (e.g., storms) that can have far-reaching public health, economic, environmental, and security implications. Several innovations in statistical and computational methods and related software development are envisioned. The proposed data products will offer quantification of forest damage/change and landslide risk assessment for Puerto Rico following hurricanes Irma and Maria. Key educational components include dissemination of proposed technologies across the scientific communities including data scientists, engineers, foresters, ecologists, and climate scientists. The PIs plan to train the next generation of data scientists through dissemination efforts for undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields.           <br/><br/>The PIs will develop a statistical framework for executing elaborate case studies and data analysis on high-dimensional remotely sensed data, where ""high dimension"" alludes to one or all of a massive number of (i) spatial locations; (ii) time points; and (iii) responses or outcomes. The PIs will introduce massively scalable multivariate spatial process models within a rich Bayesian hierarchical framework to obtain fully model-based inference for the underlying data generating process. Innovative statistical methodologies are proposed to implement hierarchical models at scales involving tens of millions of spatial locations, thousands of time points and possibly hundreds of remote-sensed variables. The massive scalability of these models will be achieved through sparsity-inducing spatial-temporal processes and other graphical models, matrix-variate low-rank models, conjugate Bayesian distribution theory, and meta-learning paradigms using approximations of a collection of posterior distributions. Theoretical results that enhance current methods will be explored as will be several proposed case studies at hitherto unprecedented scales. The PIs will develop a full suite of spatial models in a wide variety of experiments involving massive data sets. Since massive data sets are where complex relationships can be detected effectively, the proposed methods are well-suited for modeling complex scientific phenomena.

The approach extends to a robust modeling approach in case of model failures that can occur when covering a large study domain. In particular, the investigators develop Gaussian process-based emulator that models both the sparsely observed computer model and the unknown discrepancy that explains the gap between the model and reality. The approach is Bayesian which provides for the natural quantification of uncertainties. The key tool for statistical inference is to replace the standard practice of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with a novel usage of variational Bayes (VB) inference. While the variational Bayes is popular in machine learning literature, the technique is not as popular in statistics as MCMC based sampling techniques. The slow uptake the VB framework seems to be due to the additional complexities it adds to modeling and the relatively uncharted theoretical properties. This project will develop an innovative VB algorithm to resolve the present issues in computer model calibration with the aim of improving the computation scalability and extendibility in a robust modeling approach.

Computational chemistry has a long history of using the principles of quantum mechanics to create tools which provide detailed, accurate explanations for a wide variety of chemical processes. Many of these tools have reached sufficient accuracy that they can be applied to discover chemical reactions without requiring prior insight from experiment. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these methods has prevented their broad use in predicting chemical reactivity, especially in cases where the chemistry is highly complex or poorly understood. This grant supports the development of fully computational, low-cost and highly accurate methods that are able to predict the outcome of chemical reactions starting only from the feedstock molecules. The application focus of these methods is catalytic reactions, providing a highly useful tool for research into chemistries that can be applied at an industrial level to create high-value chemical products. These tools are available to the wider computational chemistry community, enabling maximized impact of the developments to a great number of problems in chemical reactivity. Due to the diversity of potential applications for this research, the students involved in this project gain not only algorithm development abilities, but also fundamental insights into processes governing molecular behavior, cutting-edge computational research experience, and problem-solving abilities that are needed to address the challenges of the 21st century. The proposed methods are transformed into educational strategies that merge introductory laboratory exercises with real-world research, starting with a pilot study in honors organic chemistry. <br/><br/>The research program builds upon work by the Zimmerman group that shows chemical reactions can be described in terms of a small number of localized, anharmonic reaction coordinates. These reaction coordinates consist of interatomic distances, angles, and torsions, and are a reliable, transferable basis for describing atomic motion. By employing advanced single-ended chain-of-states optimization algorithms which search along these coordinates for plausible chemical reactions, this research methodology can efficiently and reliably predict reactive events without guidance from chemical intuition. The main objective of ongoing work is to expand this method to cover transition metal elements, enable efficient conformation searches in systems with floppy degrees of freedom, and develop machine learning algorithms to automatically process chemical data and provide great enhancements in computational efficiency. In sum, these new reaction search techniques enable predictive reaction discovery in a wide variety of large, highly complicated chemical systems where chemical knowledge alone is not yet sufficient to make accurate predictions. These methods are being applied to challenging cases in catalysis where uncharacterized side reactions are severe impediments to efficient product formation. Ongoing discovery of these undesired reaction pathways lead to the chemical insight required to improve reaction selectivity and catalyst stability.These tools allow beginning chemistry students to hypothesize and evaluate reactions in silico, resulting in a means for students to perform research at an early stage of their studies. Such pedagogical tools are distributed to educators outside of the University of Michigan to maximize their impact."

Underlying this stunning efficiency is the energy landscape that provides ultrafast directional transfer of energy from antennae to reaction centers, and directional electron transfer within reaction centers. Exposed to high light and reactive oxygen species, plant and bacterial systems employ intricate adaptations that remodel their energy landscape to minimize photodamage. Nonlinear spectroscopy has played an important role in developing our current understanding of photosynthetic design principles. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has proven to be a powerful tool for revealing electronic structure and photosynthetic energy transfer pathways. It has also revealed quantum coherent dynamics, the physical origin of which has been hotly debated. In a number of photosynthetic systems, these coherent dynamics have been proposed to arise from electronic-vibrational resonances that may be important for photosynthetic energy transfer and charge separation. This project aims to improve the spatial resolution and ability to access dark states of current multidimensional spectroscopies and employ a combination of 2DES and fluorescence-detected 2DES (F- 2DES) to study the energy landscape, quantum coherent dynamics, and adaptive mechanisms in purple bacteria in vivo. Full understanding of photosynthetic design principles requires moving beyond previous studies that have primarily focused on purified solutions of individual photosynthetic complexes to examine how these components work together as their spectroscopic properties, relative composition and spatial organization is remodeled to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The project will also provide extensive scientific training for the graduate and undergraduate students working on the project. The project will enhance the available spectroscopic tools for probing the dynamics of local biological environments and studying energy transfer in natural and artificial systems. The extensive experimental characterization of the purple bacterial photosynthetic network will drive the development of theoretical models of the electronic structure and dynamics of multichromophoric systems. The understanding we gain from using purple bacteria as a model system may guide the future design of artificial light-harvesting materials. Building on the PI's previous success in hosting the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) in 2008 and 2015, the project will aim to host a CUWiP meeting at the University of Michigan in 2021. The meeting will seek to bring ~150 women from across the Midwest to learn about career opportunities and research in Physics and strengthen the network of US women in Physics.  The project will also support outreach to local elementary schools through coaching of Science Olympiad teams and lab tours to economically disadvantaged students from the Detroit region.<br/><br/>This research project will expand the toolset of multidimensional spectroscopies to provide unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and access to dark states to enable in vivo studies of photosynthetic function. Using purple bacteria as a model system this research will address the physical nature, functional relevance, and true dephasing time of quantum coherence in purple bacteria, how do purple bacteria remodel their energy-landscape to adapt to high and low light conditions, and how do purple bacteria adapt their photoprotection mechanisms in aerobic environments. By uncovering photosynthetic design principles in the simpler bacterial systems the PI aims to pave the way for a better understanding of plant photosystems. Such an understanding is a fundamental pursuit that will enable us to learn from Nature to meet our own energy needs through the development of artificial light-harvesting systems and biofuels.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are known to behave like an ultra-lightweight gas of artificial atoms, combining the properties of both light and massive particles.  It was shown that at low temperatures these quasi-particles condense to a collective quantum ground state known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this project, new methods will be developed to transform the coherent polariton quantum fluid into a fluid of dipolar exciton. These dipolar excitons are long-lived and strongly interacting atom-like particles in a semiconductor, featuring rich many-body physics phenomena that have just begun to be understood. The ability to perform transformations between two very different types of quantum fluids, one which is strongly admixed with light and weakly interacting, and one which is much more matter-like and strongly interacting, will allow integrating the different, complementary features of each of the fluids, and will open up a wide range of new ways to manipulate quantum fluids of matter and of light in semiconductors. The ability to modulate the collective ground states can lead to new insights on the complex physics of quantum fluids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Circadian (~24 hour) rhythms in behavior and physiology, including sleep-wake rhythms, are entrained by the sun's daily light cycle and affect physical and mental health. These rhythms are driven by the brain's master circadian clock, which receives light information from the eyes and coordinates biological rhythms throughout the body. In modern life, exposure to artificial light can erode the crucial tie between internal physiological rhythms and environmental light timing. The proposed mathematical modeling and data analysis projects focus on understanding how information and uncertainty in light signals are processed and stored in the master circadian clock and propagated downstream to sleep-wake networks through neural signaling.  In collaboration with a clinical researcher, the mathematical models will be applied to data describing light exposure and sleep in elementary school-aged children during the school year and summer to understand summer vacation-induced disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms. An additional collaborator at a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution will contribute to modeling the clock and developing a mathematical modeling mini-course for undergraduate students. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees will be involved in the research. This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology Program and the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems Neural Systems Cluster.<br/><br/>Behavioral states of waking, sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are governed by networks of brainstem and hypothalamic neuronal populations, and mathematical modeling of these networks provides insights into the dynamics of their interactions.

Using an innovative combination of mathematical modeling and analysis, key aspects of light-dependent circadian modulation of sleep-wake behavior will be explored at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Return maps will be used to reduce dimensionality and formally classify the relationship between circadian signaling and bifurcations in sleep-wake patterning. Effects of coherence of SCN activity on sleep-wake behavior will be established theoretically, and these results will be applied to understand experimentally observed changes in phase relationships between dorsal and ventral SCN regions in rodents under seasonal light variation.

However, their use for applications in quantum computing, communication and sensing has been limited by the relatively short lifetime of the excited state of the electrons in these dots.  Recently, our team have discovered that polarizing the nuclear spins in these dots leads to a surprising and dramatic increase of the lifetime by many orders of magnitude opening the potential for using quantum dots in the next generation of quantum electronics.  This project will explore the fundamental physics behind this dramatic increase in lifetime both experimentally and theoretically. The research will support the development of highly trained people, (including students from the NSF-Imes-Moore Bridge-program in Applied Physics) critical to the infrastructure of nano and quantum technology, at all levels of higher education including postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students.  The results of this research will not only open up potential applications in quantum electronics but could provide advances in areas such as magnetic resonance imaging and the development of a path for transitioning from the Moore's law to the new paradigm of a post CMOS era.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>In previous NSF supported work, we discovered dynamic nuclear spin quieting (DNSQ) in single and coupled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) produced by optical coupling to the e-h spin that is accompanied by clear dynamical nuclear spin polarization (DNSP). The results show both local and nonlocal creation of mesoscopic metastable nuclear spin configurations characterized by DNSQ. The effect is long lived (>1sec) and reflects creation and locking of a metastable mesoscopic nuclear state involving >10,000 nuclei. The underlying physics is not clear but is obviously mediated by a nonlinear coupling between the optically driven e-h spins and the nuclei of the quantum dot through hyperfine coupling. The large exciton Bohr radius results in interaction of the electron-hole spins with nearly all the nuclei in the dot, unlike a simple atom with one nucleus. The results are highly significant for application of QDs or other structures to spin based quantum electro-photonic devices, such as quantum repeaters (e -spin serves as memory and the spontaneously emitted photons serves as the flying qubit) and for the potential use of the nuclear ensemble states for quantum metrology, classical memory and perhaps even improving MRIs. The importance of this research is rooted in that locked DNSQ increases e- -spin coherence time by more than three orders of magnitude , without dynamic intervention. The theoretical studies have, thus far, not provided a unified picture consistent with all the data, and the nature of the quiescent nuclear spin ensemble states remains a mystery. The proposed theory focuses on the properties of the quiescent nuclear states vis-a-vis the thermal nuclear states under optical control of the e-spin. Spin glass concepts and methodology will be adapted to the mesoscopic nature and the spin dynamics of the ensemble, to formulate a detailed theory for a comprehensive understanding of the physics. The results could lead to advances in electronic-photonic information processing on a long time scale, such as a quantum repeater or measurement processes. The nuclear quiescent state, analogous to spin glass, may also provide a laboratory for classical computer science and beyond. The proposal has two scientific objectives: 1. Measure and theoretically understand the dynamics of the interaction between the two distinct quantum systems (the nuclear ensemble spin and the e- -spin) leading the various mesoscopic metastable DNSQ states. This includes determining both longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates of the nuclear spin in these states including determining the level of quantum coherence in the nuclear spin states following switching; and 2. Measure and theoretically predict the e- -spin decoherence in single and coupled QDs as a function of the various mesoscopic nuclear states. This work will result in improving the understanding of the interaction between a non-equilibrium microscopic quantum system (a few e-- spins) and a mesoscopic quantum system (number of nuclear spins < thermodynamic limit). The complexity of the mechanism of optical control of the e --spin states stems from the back action of the resulting modified mesoscopic nuclear state on the optically controlled e- -spins . For quantum metrology, this is a paradigm system for measuring the properties of the mesoscopic system (nuclear) via the electron states or as a quantum measurement of the correlated electron systems under the influence of the nuclear ensembles as controllable environment. For potential applications, the broad bandwidth (THz) of the quantum physics enables high-speed optical control without connectivity problems and operates at 4-10 K."

At the continuum level, the mathematical description of vesicle dynamics is a highly nonlinear, nonlocal moving boundary problem where the bilayer membrane serves as the moving boundary. The fundamental mathematical feature is that this system effectively couples surface phase dynamics, morphological evolution and compartment formation, and fluid motion so that the model describes a more realistic physical system than has been developed previously in the literature. The investigators develop and apply state-of-the-art adaptive numerical methods, perform analytical, numerical and modeling studies of important constituent processes, and work with experimentalists to test the model predictions and to help elucidate the underlying physical processes. The project will investigate how the presence of surface phases and multiple compartments modifies the classical motions and hydrodynamic interactions and may lead to novel dynamical regimes. The project will also investigate the morphological stability of multi-compartment vesicles in applied flows, and possible control strategies using multiple surface phases for optimizing stability in complex flow domains."

The NSCL group proposes to continue their experimental nuclear astrophysics program and other facilities to provide this important nuclear physics data. They will carry out a synergistic and interconnected experimental program using stable and rare isotope beams that employs a wide variety of existing experimental equipment, and continued development of key experimental capabilities. The experiments either measure astrophysical reactions directly (as they occur in nova and supernova explosions, neutron star mergers, accreting neutron stars, and other astrophysical sites) or provide indirect constraints on the reactions. <br/><br/>Interpreting multi-messenger observations with accurate nuclear physics measurements obtained in this program will open a new window on the universe providing insight into element synthesis and nuclear matter in extreme astrophysical environments.

How does structure arise in the universe and how is it related to the emergence of the elements in stars and explosive processes? What is the nature of matter at extreme temperatures and densities? and ""What is dark matter"".

Computers are often employed to make predictions of different scientific phenomena. In quantum chemistry, computations can be employed to determine the total energy of a molecule, how the molecule vibrates and rotates, how it interacts with light, and how it changes in a chemical reaction. Some quantum chemistry problems are too difficult to be solved with even the most powerful supercomputer. Fortunately, completely new types of computers, called quantum computers, are now being made as early prototype machines. These quantum computers are programmed within a paradigm that uses quantum mechanics for their operation. Hence, they are well suited to solve difficult quantum chemistry problems.  Freericks, Zgid and their coworkers design strategies for how to solve a range of different quantum chemistry problems on these quantum computers. The project is designing algorithms from scratch which are then tested on quantum computers when appropriate machines are available. The broader impact of this work includes introducing undergraduates, high school students, and citizen scientists to the field of quantum chemistry on quantum computers. The project also supports some development of chemistry topics in a quantum book entitled Quantum Mechanics without Calculus. <br/><br/>This project focuses on using a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solving quantum chemistry problems.

Isaksen<br/><br/>High-dimensional spheres are the basic building blocks of all geometric objects.  It turns out that spheres of different dimensions can fit together in only certain combinations to create more complicated geometric objects.  The computation of stable homotopy groups is essentially the same as counting these combinations.  This computation has been a major topic of research since the middle of the 20th century.  This work belongs to the field of homotopy theory, which is a technique for studying geometric objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Motivic homotopy theory is a version of homotopy theory that applies to problems in algebraic geometry.  This project exploits the similarities and differences between classical homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory to compute stable homotopy groups.<br/><br/>The computation of stable homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum is among the most fundamental problems in homotopy theory.  The projects goals are to apply Adams spectral sequences at the prime 2 to compute: (1) classical stable homotopy groups; (2) motivic stable homotopy groups over C; (3) motivic stable homotopy groups over R; and (4) C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.  These four computations are closely interrelated.  Their connections reveal structure that is not apparent within just one type of stable homotopy group.  At face value, the computation of the C2-equivariant Adams spectral sequence presents unmanageable technical complexities.  There is a path to C2-equivariant computations that proceeds through intermediate stages of C-motivic and R-motivic calculations.  At each stage, new complexities arise, but they are manageable when taken one at a time. The first step is to compute algebraic Ext groups that serve as the E2-page of the Adams spectral sequence.  These Ext groups are in themselves quite complicated, and typically are obtained with an auxiliary spectral sequence.  Since this part of the problem is entirely algebraic, computers can be used to great effect here.  The second step is to compute Adams differentials and hidden extensions. This process usually requires subtle work with Toda brackets and is no longer algebraic.  Several techniques will be employed: (a) brute force computation in a range of dimensions; (b) machine-assisted computation to produce algebraic data and to organize the many individual computational facts into a consistent whole; (c) description of the global structure of stable homotopy groups by means of periodicity operators; and (d) comparison between the Adams-Novikov and Adams spectral sequences."

Such large-scale networks are influenced dynamically by a substantial number of stochastic inputs, such as weather, aging, external attacks, composing a high-dimensional uncertainty space that propagates. Our stochastic models and sensitivity analysis we obtain reliable predictions of the network's failure uncertainty evolution and identify sensitive regions, facilitating decision making and preventive actions during catastrophic events. This study will break a new ground on identifying the most vulnerable regions also enhancing the reliability and resilience of power grid as a whole. This is of critical importance, where the environment and public safety are at risk. the novelty of our approach is that we carry out a 'detailed stochastic failure modeling' for a small yet representing component, e.g., electric wire/cable and a mechanical part subject to thermo-electro-mechanical load, and then, to develop a 'physics and math informed lumped element modeling' of failure and aging for the expanded and global system. Therefore, in our approach, the underlying physics and data-infused modeling would minimally be compromised as it is in the common practice. One graduate student will be supported in each year of this 3 year grant.<br/><br/>The power grid network in the United States is an engineering wonder of complexity, interconnectivity and robustness. However, the high connectivity can potentially lead to cascading failures with the loss of single components. The majority of disturbances is caused by natural events, such as storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes. Still, one third of major blackouts have non-natural causes, including human errors, machine failure and intentional attacks. We formulate a new computational-mathematical phase-field based model for thermo-electro- mechanical failure analysis of generating points (sites) on the power grid and the power-transmission lines. Moreover, we develop a reduced-order model which can be in real-time fashioned examined subject to different working/weather conditions across the US. Subsequently, we will approximate the 'probability failure' of the prominent source/generating points also the aging grid network links. We study the propagation of failure uncertainty front through the power grid and identify regions of 'critically high risk' which would be affected by the malfunction of power grid. The model is a robust tool for faster decision making in case of blackouts, prevention of malicious attacks and in prudent, secure expansion of the already complex power networks. With data obtained through smart grid used in monitoring power grid operations, the probabilistic framework serves as a real-time asset in the prediction of rare catastrophic events. In terms of deliverables, in addition to published papers and organization of mini-symposiums in conferences and workshops, we will also provide properly documented open source codes accompanied with benchmark power-grid simulation examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theoretical study of optimal transport has greatly advanced in recent years and calls for improved numerical tools that can be mathematically guaranteed to have good performance. This project is aimed at the development of improved numerical methods for optimal transport calculations and variants, employing partial-differential-equation techniques to produce computational tools backed by rigorous theory. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will also engage in outreach by supervising an undergraduate team through the university's Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics program, aimed at students who are at an earlier stage of study, with an eye toward recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. <br/> <br/>Specifically, the project aims to exploit the geometric information that can be discerned from the regularity theory of the Monge-Ampre type equation that arises naturally in optimal transport, in order to develop numerical algorithms with proven convergence rates, error bounds, and computational complexity.

Bombardment by large objects may have had fundamental effects on our Earth, including possibly bringing the molecules that are necessary for life.  On Earth, it is rare to see the evidence of these impacts because of the constant changes to its surface due to geological (e.g. earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) and meteorological (e.g. wind and rain) processes.  However, the Moon, due to its nearness to Earth, serves as a good substitute for understanding terrestrial impact events.  But the timing of impacts on the Moon over the last 4500 million years is not well understood.  This study will examine samples of lunar material affected by the bombardment that were brought back by the Apollo missions to try and determine how when they were formed and what they are made of.  This will help us determine what kinds of objects hit the earth, and when, potentially providing insights into their influence on Earth's evolution.<br/><br/>The PI resides at a predominantly undergraduate college, and will involve her students in studying the samples and their data so that they will learn how to manage and think critically about large data sets.  She will also bring students to the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference to present their results.  Thus, they will develop skills that will benefit them in graduate school or the workforce, and their involvement in inquiry-based learning in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields achieves a key aspect of the National Science Foundation's mission.  Furthermore, students who work with the lunar samples and their data will become knowledgeable about extraterrestrial sample characterization and may be poised to be some of the best-prepared graduate students available to work on any samples returned from both the Moon and Mars in the next ~20 years. <br/><br/>The Moon provides the most clear and complete history of impact events in the inner Solar System. Bombarded since its formation ~4.5 billion years ago, the Moon's impact record can be used to gain insights into how the Earth has been influenced by similar impacting events over billions of years.  The timing of impacts on the Moon, however, is not well understood and has been the focus of many studies.  Deciphering the lunar impact history is a complex process and lunar impact glasses, numerous in the regolith samples returned with the Apollo missions, can be used to address this issue.  This study focuses on obtaining geochemical and geochronological data on lunar impact glasses, which are pieces of melted regolith (lunar dirt) created by energetic impacting events on the Moon.  These impact glasses possess the composition of the target material and can be dated by the 40Ar/39Ar (argon) method in order to determine their age of formation, how long they have been exposed at the lunar surface, and the composition of the solar wind prior to the time of burial.  The study's objective is to understand the ages of impact glasses, along with their compositions, in order to learn more about Solar System processes.  In particular, team can begin to piece together information about the rate of impact events and their effects (if any) on Earth, as well as the changing nature (if any) of the solar wind composition."

The research in this field is well-motivated by real-life applications where resources can be allocated based on predicted waiting times, for example in call centers, health care, and cloud computing. Traditionally, in controlled queueing problems, it is assumed that the parameters of the underlying random models are known. In this project, the investigator will account for uncertainty by assuming the more realistic case where the parameters of the model are unknown. The project will generate policies that are easy to implement and broadly applicable for queueing network models under uncertainty, which will lead to better performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the project aims to develop new mathematical tools and techniques for these problems. The models in this project stem from real-world problems and the results will impact both applied probability and operations research. This research project will support under-represented minority groups and train both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project is on the asymptotic analysis of controlled queueing systems under heavy traffic with uncertainty about the parameters of the model. Two types of uncertainty are considered: Knightian and Bayesian. In the Knightian case, the decision-maker considers a worst-case criterion to be minimized by taking into account a class of models. The asymptotic analysis is performed using a limiting stochastic game, where the involved players are the decision-maker and an adversary player. In the Bayesian case, the decision-maker has a prior belief on the parameters of the model, which is continuously updated by observing the system. Here, the learning aspect of the optimization problems is of interest. The exploration/exploitation nature suggests a connection to multi-armed bandit problems. The research objectives are: (1) to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that builds uncertainty about the queueing models into the diffusion scaling heavy traffic regime, balancing between capturing uncertainty and robustness, and attaining easy-to-implement policies; (2) to consider simple policies, which are known to be asymptotic optimal in the case without uncertainty, and to examine their performance under uncertainty; and (3) to combine the following streams of research: queueing theory, diffusion approximations, uncertainty, and learning, and moreover, to develop new mathematical results beyond what is known in each stream considered separately.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, phase transitions in non-lipid components vary significantly from the bulk when a subset of components is membrane-coupled.  Some past work has explored these differences for membranes that are themselves homogeneous.  The objective of the current study is to explore systems in which both membranes and non-lipid components are capable of experiencing miscibility phase transitions.  These systems represent novel biomaterials in which membrane-based signals are actuated to non-membrane processes, similar to common themes in signaling pathways.   The research will use thermodynamic simulations and experiments in two well-defined model systems: one incorporating polyelectrolytes that form liquid phases in the bulk, and a second utilizing engineered DNA origami tiles that assemble into two dimensional lattices when coupled to membranes.   <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Lipid membranes form boundaries between animal cells and their environments and define some subcellular compartments, such as the cell nucleus and mitochondria. These membranes are primarily made of lipids, soap-like molecules that spontaneously form into fluid, flexible sheets that act as boundaries to large or charged molecules.  Cell membranes also contain embedded proteins, which are more complicated molecular machines that carry out an array of biological functions.  Within cells, the material properties of the membrane helps to organize some embedded proteins, and contributes to the assembly of larger structures that are tethered to the membrane.  Cells take advantage of this coupling to transduce signals across membranes, or to sense chemical or mechanical changes to membrane properties.  This project draws inspiration from cells to develop minimal systems to explore the fundamental concepts that underlie these biological processes.  Researchers will explore the two well-controlled systems of charged polymers and engineered DNA origami tiles tethered to membranes, and will identify how membranes influence the organization and assembly of non-lipid components and how the organization of non-lipid components impact membranes.  The long-term goal is to inspire new materials that can sense and respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli. The researchers will communicate their findings through publications, conference presentations, public lectures, and by incorporating research into undergraduate curricula.

What is not widely known is that these electrical circuits are largely contained in small semiconductor chips, that the dimensions of components of those circuits are approaching the size of atoms, and that the circuits are produced in machines containing the fourth state of matter ? plasma.  Plasmas are ionized gases that can produce chemically reactive environments, and are composed of a mix of positive ions, negative ions, electrons and neutral atoms and molecules.  Low pressure plasmas are essential to the fabrication of microelectronics devices by delivering fluxes of radicals and ions to a semiconductor wafer.  These radicals and ions then etch (remove material), deposit (add material) and passivate (change surface composition) the wafer surface through many fabrication steps to create the devices.  A voltage is also applied to the substrate holding the wafer to accelerate ions to high energies in order to activate these on-wafer processes. An important type of plasma used in microelectronics fabrication is an electronegative plasma in which the density of negative ions is much larger than electrons.  These plasmas are very sensitive to operating conditions (such as power, pressure and gas mixture), with instabilities often.  The quality of the devices being fabricated are sensitive to these instabilities and so tighter control of the plasma process is becoming more important.  Pulsing the plasma (turning the power on-and-off) and pulsing the acceleration voltage results in higher precision components with smaller dimensions, whiich translates into more powerful electronics devices. Although pulsing provides many advantages, pulsing also produces instabilities.  In order to optimize the plasma processes that are used to manufacture microelectronics devices, these instabilities in electronegative plasmas must be understood, controlled and, if possible, prevented.<br/><br/>In this project, experimental and computational investigations of pulsed electronegative plasmas are being conducted for the type of inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) that are used for microelectronics fabrication. The goal is to quantify the interactions between the pulsed sources that produce the plasma and the pulsed biases that accelerate ions into the wafer, the onset of instabilities, and methods to control those instabilities.  This investigation is being conducted in collaboration with our GOALI partner Lam Research Corp.  We are making 3-dimensional, time dependent measurements of electron density, temperature, plasma potential, current density, magnetic fields and ion energy distributions using laser and electrical probe diagnostics.  First principles modeling is being used to investigate fundamental plasma transport during pulsed transients, electrostatic-to-electromagnetic (E-H) transitions and interactions of pulsed sources and biases.  The end result will be a greatly improved understanding of pulsed electronegative plasmas of the type used for materials processing, with this understanding being rapidly translated to practice by our GOALI partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These charged particles created large currents that coupled to the telegraph wires via an inductive coupling, as what happens in transformers.   The currents that were pushed through the telegraph wires were so large they caused the telegraph machines to explode.  If this were to happen today, unless we know to turn off and disconnect the power grid, such an event would destroy modern power infrastructure. Yet solar flairs happen all the time, we can't simply turn off the power grid every time one happens.   From the time of detection, it takes 3 days for a solar flair to travel the distance to the earth.  Predicting if a solar flair will hit the earth is currently done with low resolution models, which are not particular good at predicting these events.  Increasing the accuracy to include more physics in the calculation leads to bigger calculations that simply can't be done in three days, even on modern super computers with state of the art methods.  This project centers on creating a new class of methods that could make these calculations possible.      <br/><br/>One way to begin to address the issues of simulating problems with a significant number of time scales is to use implicit solvers.   These typically lead to large systems of implicitly coupled equations.  The main bottleneck in scalable solvers for such systems is in the communication and large number of interactions that are needed to solve these systems.  In this project we are pursuing a new paradigm that solves coupled systems of non-linear PDEs, it is important to note that the pieces of the operators are typically linear.  We have developed a strategy of expanding these pieces of the operators as global convolutions that give unconditional stability when combined with explicit time stepping methods, but can be cheaply evaluated with three term recurrence relations and avoids iteration.  This approach has led to unconditionally stable solvers for problems such as degenerate advection diffusion or the Hamilton Jacobi equations.

This research has important impacts in solar energy conversion, energy transfer between molecules, and ultrafast electronic processes.  An accurate description is also valuable in the design of molecular machines and in nanotechnology. When a molecule or other quantum mechanical system is in the presence of an applied field, the lowest energy state is modified by this field. The field can also cause transitions from this ""new"" ground state to excited states.  Quantum descriptions of transitions are based on a probabilistic analysis. The existing theory of transition probabilities was developed by P. A. M. Dirac over ninety years ago, long before lasers had been developed. This theory does not make a distinction between actual excitations of the quantum system with energy absorption, and simple modifications of the energy of the lowest state due to the field.   L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz suggested a different theory, based on nonadiabatic transition probabilities, which account exclusively for true excitations.  Hunt and her coworkers have developed this theory further, to show that power absorption from an applied field is determined by the nonadiabatic transition probability.  In this project, the nonadiabatic theory is applied to describe energy uptake, energy transfer processes, and quantum thermodynamic systems.  Experimental means of determining the actual transition probability are identified during this project, and explored in collaboration with research groups in spectroscopy.  Applications to quantum thermodynamic engines are also being analyzed. Professor Hunt works closely with undergraduate students, engaging them in the supported research project, in particular those from the underrepresented minority groups and persons with disabilities.<br/><br/>Dirac's theory of transitions is based on an expansion of the solution of the time-dependent Schr'dinger equation in the instantaneous eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.  The norm-square of the total coefficient is used to find the probability of transition to an excited state.  Landau and Lifshitz separated the excited-state coefficient into an adiabatic term and a nonadiabatic term, by integration by parts in Dirac's expression. The adiabatic term depends on the instantaneous value of the perturbation; this term follows the adiabatic theorem of Born and Fock and describes the adjustment of the initial state of the system to the perturbation.  The nonadiabatic term characterizes actual transitions and depends on the time-derivative of the perturbation; this term determines the power absorption from an applied field.  In this project, applications of nonadiabatic transition probabilities are explored theoretically and tested in collaboration with experimental groups.  When a perturbing field is off-resonant with the transition frequency, the difference between Dirac's form and the nonadiabatic theory is particularly evident; the difference is also quite evident when the perturbing field is held constant for a period of time.  It is anticipated that transitions between quantum states that are coupled to other degrees of freedom should show clear-cut experimental evidence of the correct form of the transition probability.  When an electronic excitation occurs, the associated vibrational wave functions evolve on the excited-state potential energy surface; but the adiabatic component of the wave function continues to evolve on the perturbed ground-state surface.  Dirac's theory and the nonadiabatic theory lead to different predictions for the interference patterns of vibrational wave functions, after a perturbing pulse has ended and the system has returned to the ground state; this is testable in experiments.  Applications of the theory are being explored in describing the fluorescence of dye molecules, Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy, and other ultrafast processes.  Applications in thermodynamics on the quantum level are also being investigated, with a focus on the power and efficiency of quantum engines.  Participation in this project by women and members of underrepresented minority groups is strongly encouraged.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the scarcity and price of both lithium and the other metals used to create batteries provides the impetus to move beyond lithium-based technology. By virtue of its position in group I of the periodic table, lithium shuttles only one electron at a time between the two electrodes. With this project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, the researchers at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor develop materials for magnesium ion batteries. Magnesium, a group II metal, can shuttle two electrons at a time. In principle, doubling the number of electrons that react at the electrodes doubles the amount of charge that can be stored in the same volume of space. Storing more charge with the same-sized battery represents a significant advance in energy storage for portable electronics and potentially for electric vehicles. Magnesium also has the potential to yield safer batteries since this metal is less reactive with air and moisture than is lithium. However, developing this technology requires learning what chemical reactions occur at the solid electrode/ liquid electrolyte interfaces of a battery and how these reactions change the electrode surface over time, which is the focus of this project. The goal is ensuring that both safety and high charge-storing capacity are maintained over the entire battery lifetime. In addition to the advancing scientific understanding, this project involves graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students from diverse backgrounds who collaborate to combine different forms of spectroscopy and microscopy in order to interrogate what magnesium molecules form in liquid solution and to observe how these molecules transform to move electrons through lab-scale batteries. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>  <br/>This project, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, addresses two critical questions at the anode/electrolyte interface using Lewis-acid salts of magnesium alkoxide electrolytes: 1) what are the structure and composition of matter at the electrode/electrolyte interface? 2) what are the size, shape, and distribution of defects at the electrode? To answer the first question, the researchers employ electrochemistry using polished platinum single crystals, solution NMR spectroscopy, and Raman microscopy to probe the electrolyte/bulk solution interface. To answer the second question, they rely on electron microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy to probe surface reconstruction as well as macroscopic changes in the morphology of the solid electrode under varied conditions. Although the lithium-ion battery field has demanded answers to these questions to develop this familiar technology, the chemistry of magnesium is quite different. One difference that is a major advantage for magnesium is that its hexagonal crystal structure leads to metal deposits in platelet form, not as dangerous dendritic wires that could short-circuit the battery. That said, the relationship between the salt composition (what ions are present and at what concentration) and the electrodeposition growth mechanism is unknown in magnesium. The first aspect of this research is composed of experiments to specify what ionic species reside at the electrochemical interface starting from the traditional Guoy-Chapman-Stern model of the electrochemical double layer (where excess charge accumulates adjacent to the electrode). With the second thrust, the researchers study how the atomic surface and the microstructure of magnesium and the underlying electrode change with continued cycling that includes potential adsorption/desorption of ions. Overall, this knowledge teaches the battery community to connect known electrolyte design principles to long-term high current (i.e.-high power) battery function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will train undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs in modern techniques for dynamic big data with complex structures, in modern teaching methods for statistics, and provide mentoring on all aspects of professional development.  <br/><br/>This project brings together three interlinked research streams:  (1) statistical network analysis, (2) inference for dynamic systems, and (3) sequential decision making.   This project will contribute to each of these areas, developing (1) realistic models for network community detection, link prediction and dynamically evolving networks, and tools for utilizing network connections to improve prediction of outcomes of interest on network-linked data; (2) practical algorithms with provably good properties for fitting complex partially observed Markov process models, with an emphasis on scalability;   (3) sequential decision making algorithms based on reinforcement learning, with the goal of achieving excellent prediction performance and discovering interpretable decision variables.   Each research stream will offer a short intensive graduate course and a regular interdisciplinary student workshop.    Equally importantly, the streams will collaborate on topics that cut across these areas, such as inference for dynamically evolving networks or the role of social connections in predicting behavior and their impact on sequential decision making.   Training undergraduates, PhD students, and postdocs in topics at the cutting edge of modern statistics will contribute to supplying much-needed statisticians and data scientists to both academia and industry, increasing and diversifying the STEM workforce.   All three research streams have broad applications to areas beyond Statistics, such as neuroimaging, infectious disease transmission, and mobile health interventions.  The project is thus expected to have wide-ranging impact on how the problems statisticians study are approached by domain scientists."

Stemming from emerging and existing applications in networked systems, wireless communications, signal processing, economics, and ecology, this project encompasses the study of dynamically evolving stochastic systems with uncertainties, switching among different configurations, and complex structures. The networked systems of interest include financial, communication, social, biological, and ecological networks. The work will be devoted to learning the intrinsic properties of stochastic network systems, developing mathematical models and novel mathematical methods for analyzing such systems, and designing efficient computational schemes for optimization and  control of such systems to meet desired goals. The results of the research will be useful for applications to economics, nonlinear system identification and estimation, un-manned vehicles and other multi-agent systems, biodiversity in ecological systems, and social networks. This projects will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will integrate the research with teaching and student training. This work will contribute jointly to the further development of mathematical theory, computational methods and applications, and the improvement of mathematics education. <br/><br/>Motivated by a wide variety of applications, this project will study the following research topics. (1)Stochastic models with random switching will be developed and analyzed. Novel features of the systems include (i) past-dependent switching having a countable state space, and (ii) switching jump diffusions with non-local operators, finite switching set, and sigma finite jump measures. Criteria for recurrence, positive recurrence, and ergodicity will be obtained. (2) Kolmogorov-type systems under white noise perturbations, where the diffusions are degenerate, will be investigated. Applications to control dependent environmental protection zones, infectious disease and ecology will be studied. (3) New algorithms for switching diffusions and stochastic approximation will be developed and their rates of convergence will be studied. (i) For Milstein-type algorithms for solutions of switching diffusions, it will be shown that the algorithms preserve order 1 convergence rates as their diffusion counterpart. (ii) Motivated by applications to multi-agent systems, consensus, and swarming, the novelties of the stochastic approximation algorithms include the inclusion of state-dependent switching, state-dependent observation noise, and general time-dependent nonlinear functions. (4) Precise error estimates for identification of Hammerstein nonlinear systems with quantized observations will be obtained. It will be proved that the estimates escape from a small neighborhood of the true parameter with a probability that is exponentially small. (5) Accurate error bounds for approximation schemes of duplication-deletion random networks in the sense of strong approximation will be obtained. This will have impact on the study of random dynamic graphs and applications to social networks.

As an example, the developed computational methods will include an algorithm for rapidly finding the best possible simple approximation of a given function of many variables from just a few function evaluations.  If, e.g., the function one cares about is the probability of having an extreme rain event in Florida in two weeks as a function of current ocean temperatures, wind speeds, atmospheric pressures, etc. then such a method could help to provide a generic framework for quickly building up simple models to help predict such extreme rain events based on a reduced number of costly weather observations and climate simulations.  A second example of the numerical methods to be developed as part of this project include provably accurate methods for producing correct pictures of, e.g., microscopic material features from realistic ptychographic imaging data.  Such methods can help guarantee that the images one can obtain using well-planned ptychographic scans of microscopic object features (that are too small to see with the naked eye) actually look like the true object one scanned as opposed to, e.g., a distorted, fake, or even disguised version of the true object which just so happens to produce similar scan results.  <br/><br/><br/>More generally, this project will develop fast computational methods, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, for several problems that involve learning extremely large and high dimensional signals from severely underdetermined measurements. The developed numerical methods will include: (i) improved and generalized sublinear-time Sparse Fourier Transform (SFT) algorithms capable of rapidly approximating any function of many variables that exhibits sparsity in any given bounded orthonormal product basis, (ii) FFT-time and provably accurate lifted phase retrieval algorithms for approximately recovering compactly supported functions (up to a global phase factor) from their spectrogram measurements as well as new and even faster SFT-based compressive phase retrieval methods which run in only sublinear-time, and (iii) the development of new, fast, low-memory, and highly-parallel distributed density estimation algorithms for large multimodal datasets and tensors. A common difficulty in developing all three sets of algorithms for the problems above stems from the shear size of the memory and/or processing power required by their standard solution approaches, which limits both their applicability as well as one's ability to obtain fully determined sets of signal measurements for their use in many settings. In all three cases, new and computationally tractable algorithms will be developed that take advantage of hidden simplifying structure in each application above (e.g., generalized Fourier sparsity in the first case, intrinsically low rank data in the second case, and intrinsic low-dimensional geometric structure in the third) thereby providing numerical approaches capable of solving several types of large problems whose numerical solution currently lies beyond our collective capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on regression analysis of streaming data under the Spark's Lambda architecture, aiming to develop a new toolbox of Big Data analytics.  Streaming data refers to a series of data batches that arrives sequentially. Such data collection schemes have become abundant lately in biomedical fields due to the booming of many AI-enhanced medical devices that are designed to monitor safety and effectiveness of medical treatments delivered by smart personalized products, or to measure real-time physiological variables such as heart beats, body temperature, and physical activity. This so-called deep phenotyping technology has significantly changed the way of information acquisition in terms of both volume and velocity. Being the most important data analytics, the regression analysis will be rebuilt in the proposed project to address various challenges from the processing of streaming data. The resulting methodology may be applied to many practical fields, where incremental learning with data streams is of primary interest.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop an incremental statistical inference to address methodological challenges in regression analysis with streaming data stored in the Spark's Lambda architecture. Efficient incremental methodology requires no use of any historic raw data, rather only historic summary statistics and a newly arrived data batch. At the completion of this project the PI expects to make the following new contributions: (i) To develop a new theory of renewable estimation and incremental inference in the context of estimating functions; (ii) to develop an expansion of speed data flow architecture, called the Rho architecture, in which a new layer is added to carry over updates of inference-related quantities such as the Fisher information; (iii) to apply the proposed methodology in many important regression models, such as the generalized linear models, the generalized estimating equations (GEE), the Cox proportional hazards model, and the quantile regression model.

A surface is a space which looks locally like the two-dimensional plane. Examples are the surface of a football or a donut. Surfaces arise naturally in the mathematical fields of topology, complex analysis, and dynamics. Classical Teichmuller theory is an area of mathematics that studies the space of all geometric shapes on a fixed surface. It also interacts with other scientific fields, e.g. through its connections with string theory in theoretical physics. The PI's research lies in two types of generalizations of Teichmuller theory. Three-dimensional generalizations of surfaces are called three-manifolds, and these are locally like the three-dimensional space we live in. The PI will continue a long-term project to classify and understand possible shapes of three-dimensional manifolds. In Higher Teichmuller Theory, the PI will study deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces with an emphasis on understanding the metrics, or distance functions, on these spaces. The PI will also contribute to the mathematical community through involvement in the Inquiry Based Learning Center at the University of Michigan, curriculum development for undergraduate courses, serving as editor of mathematical journals, organizing conferences, and mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors.<br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies geometric representations of hyperbolic groups into semi-simple Lie groups, usually of rank at least two. It is guided by inspiration from Teichmuller theory and the overall goal is to create a general theory with some of the beauty and depth of classical Teichmuller theory.  The PI will use dynamical and geometric tools to study pressure metrics on Hitchin components. In particular, the PI will investigate an analogy between augmented Teichmuller space and an augmented Hitchin component introduced by Loftin. The PI will also study deformation spaces of finite area projective surfaces, Liouville currents associated to Hitchin representations, the class of groups which admit Anosov representations of specified type and the structure of spaces of Anosov representations. In the field of Kleinian groups, the PI will use tools developed in the proof of the Ending Lamination Conjecture to build combinatorial model manifolds for hyperbolic three-manifolds with freely indecomposable fundamental group. This project is expected to yield a finer understanding of Thurston's skinning map and to allow the PI and his co-authors to establish an iterated bounded image theorem, which was used by Thurston in the original proof of the Geometrization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds, but whose proof remains elusive. The PI will also use dynamical tools to study deformation spaces of geometrically finite groups, with the goal of proving analyticity of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and producing pressure metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to conventional metals, which are crystalline, the atomic arrangements in metallic glasses exhibit significant disorder. The high strength and elasticity of metallic glasses make them attractive for applications in medical and other mechanical devices, as well as sporting goods. However, they exhibit limited ductility and toughness, which can lead to catastrophic fracture. In crystalline materials, heat and deformation treatment are routinely used for property improvement, and the associated mechanisms have been understood for many years. A parallel understanding of the atomic-scale rearrangements in metallic glasses is a scientific challenge, since the baseline arrangements are not known. However, such an understanding is crucial to improving their properties. A recently developed method of characterizing  small atomic clusters  called shear transformation zones (STZs), undergo shape change as a result of deformation in a metallic glass, is used in this research. Analysis of time-dependent shape recovery reveals distinct signatures of STZs, resolved by the number of atoms they comprise. Critical experiments will be performed to explain previous experimental observations. The STZ dynamics will be compared between similar alloys that differ in their ductility. Atom-probe tomography, a method that can yield atomic-scale composition mapping, will be used to determine the role of potentially heterogeneous chemical composition, and its correlation with the STZ population. The expected results include realistic input into simulations of macroscopic behavior. The insights gained will help interpret a range of past experimental results, and assist future development of ductile alloys. The proposed work will promote the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, who will learn materials fundamentals, develop the ability to plan and conduct experiments and modeling, and learn to communicate their results.

However, flow localization often leads to catastrophic failure at a shear band. As in crystalline materials, thermo-mechanical treatment can improve their properties. In contrast to crystalline materials, an atomic level understanding of mechanical properties of metallic glasses and their response to thermo-mechanical treatment is still lacking. Plastic deformation of metallic glasses is accommodated by thermally activated shear of atomic clusters, known as shear transformation zones (STZs). Because there is no known mechanism for imaging STZs, their microscopic properties had been studied mostly in physical analogues and numerical models, which cover a limited dynamic range of time. Recently, the anelastic relaxation kinetics of different metallic glasses have been measured.  These measurements reveal an atomically quantized hierarchy of STZs, resolved by the number of atoms they comprise. The shape of the size-density distributions of potential STZs, obtained from the spectra, varies significantly with the alloy. The proposed work is aimed at gaining an atomic scale understanding of how the size distribution of potential STZs a) correlates with ductility, stored enthalpy and chemical heterogeneity; b) varies between conventional metallic glasses and those with intense high-frequency (beta) mechanical relaxations, which have been shown to be ductile; c) is affected by thermomechanical treatment, including thermal cycling, cyclic and elastostatic deformation. Using a combination of quasi-static and cyclic experiments, more than eight orders of magnitude in relaxation time will be covered. Relaxation-time spectra will be computed from the data. The stored enthalpy will be determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Atom-probe tomography (APT) will be used to identify deviations from random elemental distributions, including size distributions of clusters enriched in an alloying element. Correlating the APT results with the size distribution of potential STZs will elucidate the role of local chemistry in shear transformations. Experimental input will be provided for mesoscopic simulations of macroscopic behavior. The proposed work will enhance the atomic-scale understanding of processing and deformation of metallic glasses, bringing the community's understanding of metallic glass properties closer to that for crystalline metals. The results will assist the future development of ductile alloys, thus impacting future technology. Graduate and undergraduate students will a) learn materials fundamentals; b) develop the ability to plan and conduct combined experiments and modeling, and to communicate their results. The PI and/or graduate students will participate in high-school visits in under-resourced parts of the state of Michigan."

In these systems, some of the electrons are excited. There is coupling between the lowest energy electronic state and higher energy excited states. Chemists refer to the dynamics of these systems as ""nonadiabatic"" molecular dynamics. Nonadiabatic dynamics are important in biological processes, for example cellular respiration and photosynthesis.  They are also important in emerging technologies such as energy storage and photovoltaics.   These systems also very difficult to simulate because nonadiabatic dynamics are inherently quantum-mechanical.  Truly quantum calculations have a very large computational cost which puts them beyond the reach of even the most advanced currently available computers.      Computer simulations of classical molecular dynamics, however, are cost-effective for large and complex molecular systems.  The Geva group is developing a methodology for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics accurately and reliably at classical-like computational cost, using what is called a ""semiclassical"" approach.   Dr. Geva is also involved in activities to modernize and improve the physical chemistry curricula and to further develop a new Compute-to-Learn pedagogy.<br/><br/>The methodology combines the quasi-classical mapping Hamiltonian approach for modeling the electronically nonadiabatic dynamics of a multi-state molecular system with the generalized quantum master equation, for describing the reduced dynamics of the electronic degrees of freedom, and optical response theory, for calculating nonlinear time-resolved spectral signals. The synthesis of the above-mentioned three components (the quasi-classical mapping Hamiltonian, generalized quantum Master equation and optical response theory) leads to a powerful methodology, which is necessary to bridge the gap between theory and experiment. It does so by allowing one to calculate experimentally relevant quantities like electronic transition rates and nonlinear time-resolved spectral signals in an accurate, cost-effective and self-consistent manner, starting from explicitly molecular models, where the dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom is governed by anharmonic electronic-state-specific force fields. Method development takes place in the context of several model systems with increasing level of molecular detail, including two-state donor-acceptor benchmark models, models of photosynthetic reaction centers and models of triads and dyads in liquid solution. It should be noted that the above-mentioned methodology is general and not limited to the systems in the context of which it is being developed. The methods are disseminated broadly via publications, presentations in professional meetings, collaborating with experimental groups and the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation NSF program. Group members receive extensive training that prepares them for an independent career in an academic institution, government lab or industry. This research program also contributes to the university teaching mission via strengthening the relationship between computational and experimental groups, modernizing curricula of physical chemistry courses, and advancing a new Compute-to-Learn pedagogy within a peer-led honors studio where students registered to introductory physical chemistry undergraduate courses create interactive computer demos that demonstrate physical chemistry concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemically reactive liquids are used throughout society, from cleaning fluids in the home to customized solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturing; and now increasingly in biomedical applications.  Customizing the reactivity of these liquids is a challenge, particularly when the active species have short lifetimes. Atmospheric pressure plasmas are an ideal medium to produce chemical reactivity; and plasma-liquid interactions leverage the ability to generate chemically reactive species in plasmas to produce unique chemical reactivity in the liquid.  This project will also develop and support an annual one-week US Low Temperature Plasma School aimed to provide opportunities for graduate students from across the country to be immersed in low temperature plasma science and learn from leading researchers in their field.<br/><br/>In this research project, the interaction of a single water droplet with a controlled diffuse cold atmospheric pressure plasma will be investigated with the goal of quantifying the reaction of plasma produced species with liquids.  The reaction kinetics occurring near the boundary between the gas plasma and liquid, resulting in interfacial transport, becomes increasingly complex when transport and reactivity are highly coupled. This is often the case when transport includes short-lived highly reactive species as in both the plasma and liquid phases, and species transfer is transport limited. Plasma activation of aerosols and small liquid droplets interspersed in the gas plasma provides opportunities to reduce transport limits to a minimum.  The experimental apparatus at University of Minnesota will uniquely enable the investigation of plasma interactions with a single droplet of known initial and final composition, passing through a well-characterized plasma. Multi-phase plasma modeling at University of Michigan will comprehensively address this complex system. The anticipated results will, in particular, elucidate droplet charging, plasma induced droplet evaporation, transport mechanisms of short-lived species and convective transport effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The environment in which a molecule exists can determine how or even if the molecule will undergo a chemical reaction.  Hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissolved in water readily dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions but remains largely intact when dissolved in an organic solvent like acetonitrile (C2H3N).  Some reactions occur only in the complete absence of solvent molecules; chemists thus routinely create vacuum environments that are more ?empty? than outer space.  In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kevin Kubarych and his students at the University of Michigan are exploring a new type of environment that does not exist in nature, but which is also capable of dramatically altering the course of a chemical reaction. Researchers have discovered that by placing reacting molecules within a space formed by two parallel mirrors (their separation is very small, the width of roughly one human hair!) the forces that govern the chemical reaction are different than those outside of the device.  The device is called an optical resonator and it can be tuned in a manner similar to how one tunes a radio to the right frequency to pick up a given radio station.  The graduate student researchers working on this project are externally controlling the cavity to change the behavior of molecules between the mirrors, with the ultimate goal of controlling the reactions that occur in the cavity. The students are gaining valuable experience in experimental science and quantum mechanical theory, which provides the framework for understanding the interactions between molecules and optical resonator cavities.  In addition to the formal training of doctoral students, the project also entails the development of educational modules in quantum mechanics for high school students.  Professor Kubarych and his students are developing a two-week course module for the Michigan Math and Science Scholars, a program to expose high school students to exciting new and fundamental concepts in math and science. The modules allow students to learn about lasers and basic concepts in quantum mechanics via hands-on experiments and computer simulations.<br/><br/>This project employs ultrafast, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to track the equilibrium kinetics of one of the most fundamental chemical transformations, rotation about a C-C single bond while the target molecule (1-fluoro-2-isocyanato-ethane) is confined within a specially designed scanning Fabry-Perot sample cavity.  The central hypothesis is that the target molecule and cavity form a hybrid of light and matter (polaritons), and that the cavity conditions may provide an external means for controlling chemical reactions.  By comparing the reaction kinetics as well as the equilibrium between the isomers inside and outside of the cavity, it is possible to determine the influence of strong coupling in the reaction energy surface.  Varying the molecule concentration allows direct control over the coupling to the cavity and tuning the cavity length using piezoelectric transducers enables systematic variation of the cavity resonance. In addition to direct investigations of polariton-controlled ground state chemical reactivity, this project also aims to test basic concepts in chemical dynamics under strong coupling. Specifically, the project addresses new concepts in multi-mode coupling, inhomogeneous broadening, and the ability of strong coupling to alter anharmonic coupling manifested as Fermi resonances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, it is now becoming apparent that flavins can sometimes serve as carbon-carriers. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Bruce Palfey, University of Michigan, to investigate this newly recognized and not well understood type of reaction of flavins. This work is focusing on the way the protein thymidylate synthase controls the transfer and modification of a single carbon atom in an important biochemical reaction that is needed for DNA synthesis. A large number of bacteria use this type of reaction in the pathway to synthesize their DNA, so this project is elucidating a fundamental chemical process that is widespread but poorly understood. The project draws on a variety of chemical methods, some involving advanced technologies that allow very fast processes to be observed. The participants in the project, such as undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows, are receiving training in a unique blend of interdisciplinary scientific techniques, strengthening the capabilities of our technical workforce.<br/><br/>Flavin enzyme-chemistry is now extending well beyond the canonical borders set by reduction and oxidation using the transfer of hydride equivalents, thiol/disulfide interchanges, single-electron transfers, and reactions with O2. Among the surprising new findings are enzymes that make iminium adducts with reduced flavins. These iminium adducts undergo a variety of fates depending on the particular enzyme. A flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (thyX) forms thymine using a methylene derived from methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) and reducing equivalents derived from pyridine nucleotide. Recent evidence implicates the reduced flavin-iminium adduct as the carbon-transfer agent. Key reactive intermediates are being trapped and their chemical structures are being determined by NMR spectroscopy. Synthetic flavins are being used to learn about key transition states from linear free energy relationships and to gain insight into factors that favor carbon-transfer over possibly competitive hydride transfer. Proton transfers, which must be critical in controlling the transfer of electrophilic carbon, are being studied in detail by transient kinetics in the carbon-transfer route leading to thymidylate. Taken as a whole, this project is defining the catalytic strategies and challenges that many enzymes are now recognized to face.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-energy-density (HED) plasmas, a hot soup of electrons, ions and photons, exist throughout our universe in an extreme state with high temperatures of over 10,000 K and very high densities. HED astrophysical systems include accretion phenomena, supernovae remnants, and supersonic outflows or jets, to name a few.  On the astrophysical scales, such as in supernovae, HED plasma systems can be thousands of miles in size.  In the laboratory, in a fusion experiment for example, an HED plasma can be one tenth of a centimeter. This study will investigate the impacts of the strong radiation carried by photons in a laboratory-sized HED plasma on the properties of complex fluid-like turbulence typical of plasmas at lower pressures and densities.  Better understanding of this fundamental behavior in laboratory-sized plasmas can inform understanding of HED plasmas in general.  <br/><br/>The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of radiation on late-time, multi-mode hydrodynamics of an HED plasma using an integrated approach combining theory, computation and experiments. To do so, first, a late-time, hydrodynamically unstable system will be created and observed. This will be accomplished by measuring the dependence of the unstable growth of density variations and multimode perturbations, using techniques developed by the team for ongoing experiments at the National Ignition Facility and the Omega Laser Facility. These measurements will enable validation of multidimensional radiation hydrodynamics codes to design an experiment that explores the effect of radiation on the evolution of late-time hydrodynamic processes."

These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Understanding how dynamical systems change with different parameters is a very complicated and delicate question which is not even completely understood in the simplest of mathematical models. The research outlined in this proposal explores connections between different perspectives on parameter spaces associated to particular dynamical systems. For example, one of the most intriguing ways to view these parameter spaces is algebraically; that is, these parameters spaces are intimately related of roots of polynomials, an area of mathematics that, a priori, has no obvious connection to dynamics. Investigating these mysterious and somewhat surprising connections is one of the main research goals outlined in this proposal. This proposal also contains a substantial outreach component to share mathematics with high school students through mathematical fieldtrips to the Mathematics Department at the University of Michigan, and to give graduate students and postdocs opportunities to learn from each other through a series of workshops, which will be followed by companion conferences at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/><br/>A major goal in the field of complex dynamics is to understand dynamical moduli spaces. The most successful endeavor in this regard has been the study of the moduli space of quadratic polynomials where the Mandelbrot set lives; the Mandelbrot set is a universal object in complex dynamics. Much of the structure of the Mandelbrot set can actually be revealed through algebraic data; that is, there are distinguished algebraic integers in the Mandelbrot set (ie, roots of a certain collection of polynomials with integer coefficients), and these points are dense in the boundary. In the first part of this proposal, we consider collections of algebraic integers (or roots of collections of polynomials) arising naturally in the parameter space of an iterated function system. We take the topological closure of these roots and (following some work of others) develop a dynamical theory of the iterated function system to better understand the structure of this set. Much of the discussion unfolds in a way parallel to that for quadratic polynomials except there are some surprising differences and still many interesting questions to explore which link geometry, dynamics, algebra, and Galois theory. The second part of this proposal is centered around algebraic data and Thurston's Topological Characterization of Rational Maps, one of the most important theorems in complex dynamics. Associated to a postcritically finite rational map on the Riemann sphere, are three different kinds of linear operators. These operators naturally arise in the setting of Thurston's theorem, each acting on a finite-dimensional vector space. The characteristic polynomials of these operators have rational coefficients, so the corresponding eigenvalues are algebraic. This proposal explores possible connections that these operators (and their eigenvalues) have with each other, and connections that these operators (and their eigenvalues) have with the geometry and dynamics of the original rational map."

If this objective can be achieved, a wide range of technologies would be advanced, from energy conversion (e.g., light to electricity or synthetic fuel) to chemical sensing, to general improvement of chemical process efficiency.  In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professors Marcos Dantus and Benjamin Levine of Michigan State University are using a combination of experiment and theoretical modeling to design laser light pulses that can result in specific chemical reactions.  The light pulses are typically a few femtoseconds in duration (a femtosecond is one-quadrillionth of a second), and can be designed (""shaped"") to contain a desired range of light wavelengths (a range of colors), or even change wavelength over the pulse duration.  Depending on their shape, the light pulses affect the motions of electrons inside the molecules in different ways.  Since electrons form the bonds between the atoms of a molecule, it is possible to control how the bonds break and re-form.  In other words, the shape of the laser light pulses can control the outcome of chemical reactions. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project learn about light-matter interactions and collaborate with groups that consider these phenomena from different perspectives (spectroscopists theorists, and synthetic chemists). The researchers regularly include high school students in their research efforts and work closely with programs aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented students who pursue graduate study and research careers.<br/><br/>This project implements a novel strategy for achieving coherent control of the energy flow and reactivity of large organic molecules in the condensed phase. Recognizing that different electronic excited states undergo different chemical reactions, shaped laser pulses are being used to (a) populate electronic states with desirable reactivities, and (b) minimize the probability of spontaneous transition out of the desired electronic state (e.g. internal conversion). In pursuit of (b), quantum control strategies that range from semi-classical (driving the vibrational wave packet along a particular reaction coordinate) to quantum strategies with no classical analogue are being used.For example, topological effects near intersections between electronic states can be exploited to influence the reaction outcome and strong coupling, for example when potential energy surfaces are dressed by the light field.  In such cases, the natural energy flow is altered and the molecular system?s coherence with the driving field can be enhanced. Advanced quantum dynamical simulations are enabling the determination of causal relationship between the structure of the initial wave packet and reaction outcomes, thus informing subsequent experiments. Successful control of internal conversion are tracked by the fluorescence yield from higher excited states. Subsequently, similar strategies are used to drive dissociative reactions in a series of dyes, which release a highly efficient fluorophore only when excited to a higher excited state. Together, this combined experimental and theoretical effort is elucidating strategies to maximize the fraction of photon energy needed to drive a condensed phase chemical reaction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field of quantum information science (QIS) is in a nascent state with several academic, industrial and government groups striving to understand the basic physics, and to build and control many-qubit systems. QIS is approaching a tipping point where the realization of practical quantum computing systems is imminent. Considering this a workshop at Michigan State University will be held to bring together a broad community of researchers working on QIS to discuss the near future of the field, including the physical implementations of quantum computers, the most interesting open questions in the field, and the challenging fundamental and applied problems of quantum science.<br/><br/>A primary goal of the meeting is for the scientific program is the exploration of the ideas and open questions in the field of QIS. The workshop will provide a venue where these ideas and questions will be discussed as intellectual leaders in the field come together to present new results and discuss how to navigate the scientific and technological landscape of the field as it develops. The broader impacts include scientific, application-oriented, and educational/outreach components. Researcher from both inside and outside of academia will be attending the conference.  The inclusion of participants from outside of academia will provide an opportunity to student and postdoctoral attendees to learn about the quantum research and technology development going on at companies and industry labs such as Google, IBM, and MITRE. In this sense the workshop will provide an excellent complement to the cross-disciplinary training of a diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By probing the mechanistic nuances of these processes, this research will expedite design and discovery of new halogenation reactions, improved catalysts, and efficient routes to complex structures. The project's interdisciplinary combination of organic syntheses, spectroscopic techniques, isotopic analyses, and quantum chemical models offers an excellent opportunity for doctoral students to be trained at the interface of analytical, organic, and physical chemistry. Working with PIs of very different backgrounds, the chemistry graduate, undergraduate (UG), and summer high school (HS) students who perform the research learn critical thinking and communications skills, besides the multiple lab techniques they must master.<br/><br/>Professor Borhan's discovery that organocatalyst (DHQD)2PHAL promotes chiral delivery of halogens to alkenes and related substrates opens the door to reactions analogous in generality and utility to recent asymmetric epoxidations, dihydroxylations, and hydrogenations, landmark tools of organic synthesis. These novel stereocontrolled halocyclizations give rapid access to complex structures of biological and pharmaceutical importance. Mechanistic studies employ kinetic analyses; solvent effect surveys; isotopic labeling both to trace stereochemistry and to identify key rate- and product-determining steps via kinetic isotope effects; design and synthesis of electronically adjustable substrates and halogenating agents; multinuclear and multidimensional NMR techniques to probe molecular interactions; and detailed quantum chemical simulations to guide and interpret experiments. Molecular modeling and mechanistic explorations also benefit from the involvement of Professor James Jackson, a physical organic chemist with substantial experience in computational, catalytic, and green chemistry areas, who serves as a Co-PI on this grant."

Chirality, also referred to as handedness, is an important property of molecules.  Human hands are not identical, but mirror images of each other (the two hands are not superimposable).  The relationship between two objects that are mirror images of each other, have a center of chirality, and are referred to as enantiomers. There are numerous examples of enantiomers in biology and medicine.  For example, Thalidomide, a drug that was used in the late 1960s and early 1970s, led to the embryonic mis-development of a number of babies is an example of a mixture of enantiomers.  One of the enantiomers was biologically active as an anti-nausea agent to treat morning sickness in pregnant women.  The other enantiomer was teratogenic, which interfered with the correct embryonic development.  The drug was given as a mixture of the two enantiomers, causing tragedy.  From this experience, scientists have learned that the ability to identify the chirality of a molecule is of utmost importance.  The Borhan group is developing new methods to rapidly identify the chirality of organic molecules to ensure the safety of drugs such as Thalidomide.  Professor Borhan organizes and leads Project SEED activities at MSU.  Project SEED is a ten-week summer program funded in part through the American Chemical Society and various organizations at MSU, to support the research of high school students from financially-disadvantaged families.  <br/><br/>The goals of the project are to provide simple, rapid, efficient, and non-ambiguous procedures for the absolute stereochemical determination of chiral organic molecules, many of which are synthetic intermediates of bioactive compounds or newly isolated pharmacologically-active metabolites.  The project relies heavily on Circular Dichroism (CD) as the tool for observing the host-guest interactions between the chiral compounds and the receptors.  The functionalities of interest include chiral epoxides, phosphines, phosphine oxides, boranes, alkenes, alkynes, and alkyl arenes.  In addition, the endowed helicity of the supramolecular complexes, induced through  interactions with the bound asymmetric guest molecules, will be used towards asymmetric catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These seminars have been held annually since 1981. They have become a crucially important regular conference series for probabilists in North America, bringing together a diverse group of accomplished researchers, early-career investigators, and graduate students in probability and stochastic processes.  The primary goal of SSP 2020 is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work with others. The five scholars who will be the main speakers at SSP 2020 were chosen for their prominence as researchers in stochastic processes, and for the breadth of their research areas as a group, to maximize the participants' exposure.  SSP 2020 will include additional activities intended especially for new researchers and they will take the form of two 90-minute tutorial lectures delivered by a speaker selected by the Probability Subcommittee of the IMS New Researchers Committee and a panel discussion on topics of particular interest to early-career researchers. This conference will be an extraordinary opportunity for students and early-career researchers to learn the latest developments in probability and related topics, and to interact with leading researchers.<br/><br/>Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and other under-represented or marginalized groups, as well as to early-career faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.  The topics covered in this edition of SSP will include Brownian motion and Levy processes, stochastic analysis, stochastic partial differential equations, random matrix theory, fractional Brownian motion and rough path theory, random media, and application to fluid mechanics, statistical physics, climate science, and mathematical biology.

This truly unique study covers an enormous range in physical scale, from the smallest observable clouds to clusters of galaxies, to show the real dynamical interaction between the visible galaxies and their surroundings.  Junior researchers and students will learn how to run and to interpret state-of-the-art numerical simulations, and how to carry out data mining on existing observation archives.<br/><br/>The circum-galactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse gas surrounding galaxies that acts as a fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center.  Recent discoveries show that the CGM is dynamic, rapidly evolving, has significant mass, and plays a key role in determining the mass, shape, and star-forming properties of galaxies.  This project applies a new combination of data with models to examine the role of the CGM in galaxy evolution over seven orders of magnitude in physical scale, which is required to truly understand its conditions and kinematics.  The data will be mined from existing archives, and the models will come from a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The rigorous comparison will use a toolkit developed by this team to produce mock datasets from simulations, which can then be analyzed in concert with the real data.  This work should solve several puzzles: 1) although abundant in chemical elements, the dense CGM is not as well-mixed as predicted; 2) galaxies have massive reservoirs of metal-rich gas that should have an extremely short cooling time; 3) the cool CGM is too diffuse to be in pressure equilibrium with a hot galactic corona; and 4) there is just as much cool, neutral gas in the CGM of passive galaxies as in that of star-forming galaxies, so that this gas can be neither fuel for, nor a by-product of, star formation.  This understanding can only be gained by a breakthrough in understanding physics at the scales of the smallest individual clouds that observations can detect, which is not possible except by using multi-scale simulations rigorously coupled to data.  The study will reveal the physical state of CGM gas, constrain the timescales over which CGM clouds evolve, and determine the mass flow rates and total masses moving in and out of galaxies.<br/><br/>These results will be the focus of outreach talks by all team members to the diverse communities in the areas around the different institutions involved.  The project will involve junior scientists in front line research, especially targeting under-represented students, and contributing to mentoring skills amongst the intermediate-level researchers.  It will also support development of a new planetarium show that includes visualized hydro-dynamical simulations of the gas in galaxies."

The investigators have measured the positions of nearly all the luminous star clusters associated with Centaurus A, and will precisely measure their velocities using large ground-based telescopes.  Using observations of the collection of star clusters, and their motions around Centaurus A, the investigators will measure the dark matter density profile of the galaxy, and search for remnants of smaller galaxies that have merged with Centaurus A.  The important goal of their observations is identifying large star clusters which are the remnants left over from smaller galaxies after they have been devoured by the larger Centaurus A.  By studying the motions of these star clusters in detail, along with the smaller galaxies it has destroyed, they will have a complete inventory of the 'dark side' of Centaurus A.  Their results will be applied to studies of all galaxy populations.  The investigators will present the science results from this program to visitors at the National Science Foundation's Kitt Peak National Observatory, by implementing a new docent training program at the visitor center.  The investigators will travel to Bryce Canyon National Park and present their results, through summer internships, which ultimately teach 16,000 visitors about the night sky.<br/><br/>The currently favored cold dark matter model makes clear predictions for the sub-halo mass function and dark matter density profile of galaxy-sized halos, but quantitatively verifying these predictions is challenging.   Centaurus A's dark matter density profile will be measured, using the kinematics derived from a nearly complete sample of star clusters, and the results compared to recent simulations that suggest galaxies with recent mergers and active galactic nuclei should have shallow dark matter profiles.  By combining the star cluster kinematics with an already existing red giant branch star map, the visible, accreted substructures will be identified and weighed.  Finally, a complete sample of ultra-compact dwarfs will be analyzed, including a search identifying them as the central compact remnants of stripped dwarf galaxies.  Accounting for this population of sub-halos is a novel aspect of this program, and one that has largely been neglected when testing galaxy formation models.  These efforts will test major predictions of the cold dark matter model at sub-galactic scales in our nearest elliptical galaxy neighbor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
