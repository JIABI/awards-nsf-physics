Oil and water don't mix. Examples of this common wisdom are prevalent in everyday life from the sheen formed on a rain puddle by spilled gasoline, to the separation of oil and vinegar in a bottle of salad dressing. These are large-scale examples of a physical principle known as hydrophobicity - a word derived from Ancient Greek that characterizes the ""horror for water"" experienced by particular molecules. This physical principle is also active at microscopic scales, with hydrophobicity playing an important role in controlling the structure and function of molecules in water. Of particular interest is the behavior of proteins: a class of molecules that use the hydrophobic effect to perform functions critical to life, serving as - among many other things - enzymes to help break down food, hormones to regulate physiology, and antibodies to protect against infection. Some physical forces can be described by simple and elegant equations, such as Newton's law of gravitation or Coulomb's law of electrostatics, but decades of work have shown that no such simple descriptions seem to exist for hydrophobicity. Instead, the hydrophobic interaction is a very complicated force that depends sensitively on the details of the hydrophobic molecule and its interactions with the water molecules around it. Unraveling the details of this interaction in the context of proteins is important in helping understand the fundamentals of this ubiquitous and important force, and in helping discover and design proteins to serve as new drugs or novel molecular machines.<br/><br/>How might one probe and understand the complexities of hydrophobicity? Artificial intelligence techniques are now ubiquitous in modern life, serving as recommendation engines for online shopping, automatically recognizing faces in camera phones, and enabling autonomous and assisted driving. Conventional computer programs work by executing a pre-programmed set of rules to achieve an outcome; modern artificial intelligence techniques are instead provided with a set of examples and automatically learn the rules from the data. This research project will use artificial intelligence techniques to learn the rules of hydrophobicity from computer simulations of water around proteins. Specifically, using sophisticated molecular simulations to model the interactions and dynamics of water molecules, and special tools to measure hydrophobicity, databases of the ""horror for water"" of different regions of the protein surface will be compiled. Artificial intelligence tools will then analyze these databases to find a mathematical model between hydrophobicity and the chemical composition and shape of the protein surface. The models learned in this way will help untangle the complexities of hydrophobicity, and can be used to quickly predict how proteins in water will behave. The tools will also be adapted and analyzed to provide human-interpretable explanations that help provide new understanding of hydrophobicity rather than just furnishing a complicated mathematical model.<br/><br/>These research activities will provide new models and understanding of protein hydrophobicity that can be used to search for new drug molecules and engineer proteins with new structures and functions. The simulation and artificial intelligence tools will be made broadly available to the scientific community and general public through open source molecular simulation packages, free software libraries, and through online code sharing sites. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research projects through 10-week paid summer internships to be offered in each year of the award. These research experiences will be designed according to best practices in providing authentic and valuable training experiences, and special efforts will be made to recruit students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math fields.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This EAGER award supports research and education involving a new collaboration kindled at the MATDAT18 Datathon event focused on integrating sophisticated molecular simulation tools with machine learning techniques to understand hydrophobicity at the nanoscale. The hydrophobic effect - the tendency for non-polar moieties to cluster together and exclude water molecules in aqueous solvent - plays an important role in the interactions and assemblies of complex molecules, such as cavitands, dendrimers, and proteins. However, quantifying the hydrophobicity of such molecules, which display complex chemical and topographical patterns at the nanoscale, has proven to be an enduring and open challenge. Recent work has illuminated the failure of additive approaches that attempt to break down molecular hydrophobicity as a sum of the hydrophobicities of the constituent surface groups, and demonstrated that hydrophobicity at the nanoscale is a complex, collective, many-body response of hydration waters to chemical and topographical surface cues. This complexity not only frustrates a fundamental molecular understanding of hydrophobicity at the nanoscale, but also has important practical consequences, such as the inability to accurately screen ligands for drug discovery.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research project is to conduct enhanced sampling molecular simulations to accurately quantify the hydrophobicity of an extensive library of nanostructured surfaces through the free energy of cavity formation, and to deploy supervised machine learning techniques to unveil new understanding of the physical, chemical, and topographical cues governing surface hydrophobicity. The central hypothesis of this project is that the application of data-centric tools can provide new understanding of the molecular determinants of hydrophobicity beyond what is possible with simple conceptual models and human intuition. The first objective of this work is to quantify the hydrophobicity of an extensive library of patterned self-assembled monolayer surfaces and proteins by estimating the free energy of interfacial cavity formation using enhanced sampling techniques. The second objective is to conduct supervised learning over the hydrophobicity libraries to construct quantitative structure property relationship models relating chemical composition and physical structure to the free energy of interfacial cavity formation. A number of machine learning techniques will be explored, including support vector machines, random forests, partial least squares regression, and artificial neural networks. The techniques will be adapted to be physics-aware by ""baking in"" the physics of hydrophobicity into the model, and to be explainable by furnishing human-interpretable understanding of their behaviors.<br/><br/>Successful completion of this research will have impacts in both materials and data science. From a materials science perspective, unveiling the molecular determinants of protein hydrophobicity - the relation between the topographical and chemical patterns displayed by the protein and the free energy of cavity formation - will shed new light on the driving force behind protein interactions and assembly, furnish precepts for rational engineering of protein structure and function, and open up applications in virtual high-throughput screening for the computational discovery of drugs, ligands, bioseparation agents, and co-solutes to modulate protein solubility. From a data science perspective, this work will establish new physics/chemistry-aware machine learning tools whose behaviors are more interpretable and comprehensible in the analysis of molecular behaviors than generic off-the-shelf techniques.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kinases are a family of proteins responsible for controlling virtually all signaling processes in multicellular organisms.  Such processes are fundamental to life itself, and play a critical role in cell division, cell growth and motility, and cellular transport.  Consequently, kinases also represent potential targets for novel cancer drugs.  There are several hundred kinase proteins, organized into complex signaling pathways. Each pathway acts like a set of cascading dominos: once an initial chemical trigger occurs at a key location on the kinase molecule, it sets in motion a series of downstream reactions translating into specialized molecular functions.  Since individual kinases can participate in multiple cellular processes, these signaling pathways are often highly intertwined.  To determine the function of a particular kinase, scientists utilize small molecules as chemical probes that bind to the kinase, suppress its activity, and enable the analysis of downstream impact on cellular function. However, a significant challenge is that most existing chemical probes are not as selective as originally thought: many probes act on multiple kinases at once.  Experimental ""wet lab"" testing of all possible combinations of hundreds of kinases against tens of thousands of potential chemical probes is not practical due to cost.  Professor Karanicolas and his students are utilizing state-of-the-art advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, publicly-available data on select kinase-probe interactions, and specialized techniques developed in his laboratory for modeling the 3D structure of protein-small molecule binding, to develop a computational model that accurately predicts kinase binding affinities and chemical probe selectivity.  The project's discoveries have the potential for significant impact in facilitating fundamental studies of cell biology, as well as the identification of selective kinase inhibitors for pharmaceutical design.  The new methods are being implemented in software distributed through public repositories and the widely-used Rosetta software suite. The research is providing cross-disciplinary training opportunities fusing chemical biology and data science to students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. <br/><br/>Modern cell biology leans heavily on kinase inhibitors as chemical probes for analyzing the consequences of deactivating a particular kinase, but the majority of commonly-used chemical probes are not sufficiently target-selective for robust interpretation of observed phenotypes.  By assembling large panels of kinases (corresponding to much of the human kinome), it is possible to experimentally determine selectivity for a given probe: however, these experiments are expensive and impractical to perform at scale.  This project is applying deep learning techniques to predict the binding affinities of individual inhibitor/kinase pairs, using 3D structural descriptors derived from a novel method for modeling inhibitor/kinase complexes, recently developed in the Karanicolas group.  Following careful training and benchmarking, the predictive model is being used in two ways: 1) to evaluate the selectivity of chemical probes that are widely used by cell biologists, and determine which compounds constitute useful tools and which compounds should be deprecated; and 2) to screen a large chemical library of small molecules to identify new candidate probes that are expected to have strong binding affinity and selectivity for a given kinase. The model's predictions in both applications are being tested experimentally through biochemical assays. While it has long been hypothesized that inclusion of 3D structural features would improve existing machine learning approaches for predicting protein/ligand binding affinities, the availability of a rapid and accurate method for building 3D structural models will allow this hypothesis to be tested for the first time. If successful, insights from this project will provide a starting point for developing models to predict binding affinities of other protein-ligand complexes as well, for expanded applications in cell biology and drug discovery.  The results of the project are being disseminated as publicly-available source code through SourceForge, and as modules within the widely-used Rosetta software suite.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multigrid methods, including both geometric and algebraic multigrid (GMG and AMG) methods, are effective tools for solving linear as well as nonlinear algebraic system of equations arising from scientific and engineering computing.  On the other hand, there is a significant advancement in machine learning (ML) techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN), which have successful applications in many areas such as image classification and processing.  The proposed project is to explore the resemblances and differences between these two different technologies so that more efficient multigrid methods as well more efficient deep learning models are developed.  The existing rich theory of multigrid method is expected to shed new light to the theoretical understanding of deep neural networks whereas the numerous empirical techniques used in the vast and ever-growning deep learning literature can be used to design general multigrid methods with wider range of applications.  This interdisciplinary research project is expected to have a direct impact to both the scientific computing community and the artificial intelligence industry.<br/><br/>More specifically, MG and CNN are similar for the use of multilevel hierarchy and the use of many technical components such as smoothers (MG) versus convolutions (CNN), restriction (MG) versus convolution with stride (CNN). But they also have some major differences: CNN has multiple channels of convolutions to be trained whereas MG often has one single smoother given a priori. Such relationships motivate the design of new multigrid methods with more general smoothers and restrictions that are subject training in different ways and, as a result, multigrid methods will become more adaptive and robust in its application to different practical problems.  The well-understood MG structure and theory can be adapted to understand and improve the existing deep learning model such as residual neural networks.  Furthermore, multilevel iterative techniques used in MG will also be investigated to speed up the stochastic gradient descent method that is now the standard training algorithm for most deep neural networks in machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most molecules are flexible, and at room temperature can exist in multiple interconverting geometries called conformers.  As molecules increase in size, complexity, and flexibility, the number of possible stable conformers increases exponentially. To accurately predict molecular properties, it is important to take into account all geometries---even those lower-probability conformers---if they have some probability of spontaneously forming at a given temperature.  Thus, a challenge is to efficiently identify these conformers despite an extremely complex, multi-dimensional geometric search spaces.  Professors Hutchison and Koes implement a unique grid-based neural network approach to predict conformers, trained on databases of high-quality calculations generated using NSF XSEDE supercomputing resources.  The machine learning techniques are validated against experimental and computational benchmarks.  They are also applied to developing improved methods for identifying drug targets, and for optimizing the design of plastic electronic materials. The databases and software developed for this project are publicly disseminated.  New tutorial resources are developed for Avogadro and 3DMol.js software tools, and new educational components on programming, visualization, and statistical machine learning areincorporated into the ""Mathematics for Chemists"" course taught by Professor Hutchison.  Both investigators give open lectures on data science and chemistry to the public and to local high school students.  They are also actively engaged in outreach to underrepresented groups through the American Chemical Society Project Seed, Pittsburgh Public Schools Science and Technology Academy, and the Drug Discovery, Systems, and Computational Biology Summer Academy for high school students.<br/><br/>The first part of this project draws upon a connection between statistical thermodynamics and Bayesian statistics. Using experimental and computational data, one can estimate distributions of dihedral angles for most molecules. From such probabilities, Bayesian optimization can be used to accurately explore and sample Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of the potential energy surface. The second aim takes advantage of recent improvements in quantum chemical methods for predicting thermochemistry for organic molecules. Using these accurate energies in tandem with experimental and other computational databases, recurrent neural-network thermochemical models are produced for molecules of different sizes and containing a wide range of elements. The resulting large data repositories and open source software tools are disseminated to the community, and used as the foundation for educational materials in a new curriculum for chemistry.  They are providing the basis for ongoing outreach and broadening participation activities to high school and undergraduate students, involving a state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary mix of data science, machine learning, and computational chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the emergence of cooperation and fairness in biological and social systems is one of the great puzzles.  How did it arise that humans often seek fair outcomes, when natural selection is inherently unfair?  Evolutionary game theory, a mathematical framework to capture the dynamics of decisions, provides some answers.  The theory finds applications in economics, military strategy, and biology.  This project develops a more extensive theory of distributed social learning and emergent group dynamics, combining aspects of evolutionary game theory with statistical mechanics and machine learning to explain the emergence of cooperation, fairness, and other social dynamics that do not fit well into traditional approaches.  The mathematical framework developed can be applied to problems in evolutionary psychology and artificial intelligence.  In particular, some results may help to inform policy makers on the origins of differing behaviors in different societies.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>This project develops a coherent theory of distributed social learning and emergent group phenomena in complex systems, merging aspects of evolutionary game theory with statistical mechanics and machine learning.  Using public goods games and ultimatum style games as a foundation, the investigators study the evolutionary dynamics of finite populations whose encounters are described in game-theoretic terms using simple parameterized rules and random interactions.  An aspect of these evolutionary systems is convergence to non-Nash fixed points, including a sensitive dependence on initial conditions and sample paths realized.  Basins of attraction for these fixed points are characterized using techniques from topological data analysis.  Using insights from statistical mechanics, the distributions of potential population fixed points are derived and related to the information content in the dynamical system; here the speed of spatial interactions plays a role analogous to that of temperature in a gas of interacting particles.  Possible equilibrium states in these dynamical systems are categorized, along with the corresponding equilibrium point distributions.  Quantifying information transfer among interacting or moving agents is an additional goal of the project.  So also is determining the impact of commoditized information, whether beneficial or harmful, on equilibrium distributions and convergence.

To understand brain function, it is therefore paramount to efficiently measure and analyze neuronal network architecture. However, measuring the connectivity of large neuronal networks remains a challenge both experimentally and theoretically. An often more tractable approach to reconstructing connectivity in complex networks is to instead measure the dynamics of neurons of interest, and then use mathematical approaches to infer the network connectivity. This project will utilize the widespread sparsity found in brain networks to develop an efficient mathematical framework for reconstructing neuronal connectivity from limited measurements of neuronal dynamics. Upon accurately recovering the architecture of neuronal networks, this project will investigate how the sparse structure of natural stimuli impacts the early development of neuronal connectivity and what functional implication this has in the encoding of diverse classes of sensory signals. Analyzing the neuronal dynamics that optimally encode network connectivity and stimulus information, this project will provide new insights into sensory processing and abnormal brain function. In formulating novel methodologies for processing dynamic network data, this project will inform advances in artificial intelligence and prosthetics. This work will actively involve undergraduate students in all phases of research, promoting interdisciplinary scientific collaboration and deepening the scope of applied mathematics education for a diverse spectrum of students.<br/><br/>With the increasing prevalence of network models in the mathematical sciences, accurately measuring network structure and understanding its relationship with network function is of broad scientific importance. In neuroscience in particular, efficiently measuring large-scale brain connectivity and determining its impact on cognitive function is inherently challenging yet fundamental in characterizing the nature of computation in the brain. This project will formulate a novel framework for the reconstruction and characterization of neuronal connectivity by taking advantage of the widespread network sparsity found in the brain and utilizing recent advances in compressive-sensing (CS) theory.  Key facets of the project are to: (1) develop a novel CS-based mean-field approach for efficiently reconstructing sparse connections in physiological neuronal networks based on underlying input-output mappings embedded in the nonlinear network dynamics; (2) analyze the role of the balanced network operating regime in CS reconstruction of recurrent network connectivity; (3) investigate the basis for structural motifs in the visual system through supervised learning of neuronal connectivity aimed at optimized compressive encoding of sparse visual stimuli; and (4) characterize the functional role of  receptive field structure in the encoding of natural scenes through compressive network dynamics and the manifestation of related deficiencies in processing non-natural scenes, such as illusory images. This work will underline how the network dynamical regime impacts the inference of structural connectivity and network inputs from neuronal dynamics, improving the scale over which neuronal connectivity can be determined and providing novel insights into abnormal information processing in the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this, the PI will focus on the ?glue? that binds one atom to another to form molecules and materials: the exchange-correlation energy. In this research, the PI will develop even more accurate approximations for this ?glue? that still permit efficient simulation on computers.<br/>Kohn-Sham density functional theory is widely used in physics, chemistry, and materials science to predict what atoms, molecules, and materials can exist and with what properties. Starting from the first principles of quantum mechanics, this theory constructs the ground-state energy and electron density of a many-electron system from an auxiliary system of non-interacting electrons including the contribution from the ""glue"", facilitating practical computation. The exact exchange-correlation energy must be approximated. Widely predictive approximations should themselves be based upon first principles, and be accurate enough to predict the small energy differences between competing states in complex materials and systems. The strategy of this project is to achieve more accurate but computable general-purpose approximations by incorporating more of the mathematical properties of the exact universal density functional for the exchange-correlation energy, i.e., by satisfying more exact constraints, by fitting to more appropriate systems in which the approximation can be either exact or highly accurate, and by carefully testing and validating the new approximations over a wide range of systems. <br/>Long-term practical benefits to society could include new medicines, chemicals, materials or devices.

These functionals will be designed to satisfy the known exact constraints on the exact functional. <br/>A smoother and more perfected version of the SCAN (strongly constrained and appropriately normed) meta-generalized gradient approximation will be developed, using as appropriate norms not only the uniform electron gas but also many real atoms. Also, the PI aims to continue developing a generalized Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction to the improved SCAN that should be exact for all one-electron densities without losing accuracy for many-electron densities.   These advanced functionals will be tested on the many systems for which SCAN has succeeded, including liquid water, structural energy differences in solids, artificial molecules, and the high-temperature superconducting materials, and on the few for which it is known to fail, such as some bulk transition metals and alloys, as well as on additional complex or strongly-correlated systems. <br/>Improvements to long-range van der Waals corrections, and a self-interaction correction to the random phase approximation, will also be made and validated. Understanding what makes a functional predictive should guide the burgeoning effort to develop density functional approximations by machine learning. <br/>The intellectual merit of the proposal is that many known mathematical properties of the exact functional should make the resulting approximate functionals widely and accurately predictive, at reasonable computational cost, and thus make them useful for many applications, not only for the simpler molecules and materials for which density functionals are already reliable, but also for the more complex or strongly-correlated ones. In particular improved functionals are critically needed for high-throughput searches for new materials with desired properties.

Current transistor-based digital circuits are not well suited for AI and finding new materials with novel functionalities, enabling new device principles is critical to the progress in this field. This project aims to bring advanced knowledge of material properties evolution upon working (cycling) conditions for a specific type of devices, namely for switches based on tantalum oxide that can repeatedly change the electrical resistance between high and low values as the result of the applied bias. The applications of such structures include non-volatile solid state (no moving parts) memories and artificial synapses mimicking the functions of the human brain. The research emphasizes understanding of material properties and the processes controlling the resistance of such device. The parallel goal is to educate the next generation of engineers for the electronics industry workforce. The components of the plan are (i) reaching out to high school students through 'Engineering@CMU' program, (ii) involvement of undergraduates in research through Semiconductor Research Corporation - Undergraduate Research Opportunity program, and (iii) holding regular conference calls with companies such as Intel and IBM.<br/><br/>Technical description: Resistive switching devices have been demonstrated more than a decade ago but many of the desired performance criteria have not been met. This is, in part, due to our poor understanding of the processes involved in resistance switching and, in particular, the formation and evolution of a conducting filament within highly resistive oxide layer. Resistive switches encode information by redistribution of ions both vertically between the functional oxide and the electrodes and laterally within the oxide film. The research aims to map out the ion motion in the oxide film as a function of device bias history semiconductor by recording two- and three-dimensional elemental maps by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron and atom probe tomographies. Of particular interest is the filament evolution toward the end of device lifetime. The analysis of end-of-endurance material properties leads to identification and prediction of the device failure mechanisms. The experimental distribution maps are being simulated by the finite element model based on diffusion equations including motion of ions and transport of heat and electric charge with additional restrictions imposed by the electrical biasing circuit. The model is intended to be universal for the entire class of resistive switching devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also a field ripe for modern statistical development, since nonparametric models are in a sense even more appealing in the ""big data"" era, as it is precisely in data-rich settings that the increased flexibility of these models will begin to show real rewards in terms of statistical accuracy. The proposed work will develop nonparametric methods (and affiliated software) that will be useful to data scientists who model smooth, nonlinear trends in areas like those mentioned above, as well as many others. A specific scientific emphasis will be the forecasting of influenza and dengue fever. Such forecasts will help policy makers design and implement more effective countermeasures towards these diseases. The proposal puts forward two main ideas for educational training, closely related to the research aims to be pursued. The first is a set of short videos on nonparametric smoothing, intended as supplements to an undergraduate level course called Advanced Methods for Data Analysis. They will be integrated with an interactive quiz system, and will be made freely available (on YouTube) so that others outside the class may watch too. The second idea is a statistical computation training group, for PhD students from Statistics and Computer Science.<br/><br/>""Locally adaptive"" nonparametric methods offer more fine-grained flexibility than traditional nonparametric methods, in that they can simultaneously represent different amounts of smoothness at different parts of the function domain. Currently, locally adaptive nonparametric methods are not often used in big, modern data sets, likely because of their computational inefficiency, and the general inavailability of locally adaptive methods in many modern problem settings. The proposed work seeks to change this, and to push the state of the art in modern locally adaptive nonparametric estimation. The research aims are to: deepen the theoretical understanding of existing locally adaptive methods for univariate problems; efficiently scale these methods and extend these theories to problems where data are collected in high dimensions and over graphs; and develop inferential tools for all of these locally adaptive procedures. The specific contributions will be balanced between the theoretical (statistical theories that describe the underpinnings of the methods in question) and computational (practical algorithms that describe implementation of these methods at scale) perspectives. A final more applied research aim is to use the proposed methods to improve and extend a forecasting system for major epidemics such as influenza and dengue fever."

Recent advancements in technological devices, such as smart phones, batteries, and solar cells, are consequences of the discovery and application of novel materials. Computer simulations of systems of atoms could be insightful in predicting and discovering new materials. Simulations based on quantum mechanics are computationally expensive and prohibitive for all but for systems of a few atoms. Simulations involving a much larger number of atoms can be done using molecular dynamics which utilizes models for the interactions between atoms. ReaxFF is one such interaction model which can also describe chemical bonding. Currently, more than a thousand academic groups and companies are using ReaxFF to model systems of atoms. It takes many parameters to fully specify a ReaxFF model. These parameters control the interactions between atoms and must be individually optimized for different types of materials. Due to the prohibitively large number of possible combinations of parameters, this optimization process is time consuming and complex, and consequently limits the applicability of ReaxFF. A procedure that can produce optimum parameter sets within a reasonable time will facilitate novel material research by accelerating the investigation of underlying physics and chemistry on the scale of atoms. Recent developments in machine learning are promising in terms of solving such high dimensional global optimization problems. The goal of this study is to develop a procedure that will enable fast and high-quality force field development using machine learning models and make this procedure accessible to all current and future ReaxFF users.<br/><br/><br/>The results of this project can also be applied to other large-scale multi-objective optimization problems and can have impacts on many scientific disciplines that involve large and complex data.

ReaxFF is a commonly used reactive force field method, capable of simulating bond formation and dissociation in large atomistic systems. In order to reveal the physics behind these systems accurately by using the ReaxFF simulations, the force field parameters must be optimized for each different materials system, and the high-dimensional force field parameter landscape should be explored thoroughly during optimization. However, the large number of existing parameters limit the optimization stage of the force field development, as the conventional optimization approaches become time-consuming. This challenge can be resolved by the development of an efficient optimization framework. In this project, an efficient sequential optimization framework will be developed, including a ""minimum energy"" sequential search and a novel ""divide-and-conquer"" strategy for efficient Gaussian process modeling. This study will make ReaxFF force field development more practical, which will enable fast access to physics and chemistry in a wide range of material systems to enhance novel material design.<br/>    <br/>This project can serve is an example of how rigorous statistical/machine learning methods can be used to tackle important problems in materials science and engineering. The project may be transformative, as it can empower the atomistic-scale understanding of materials systems by using novel techniques in data science and machine learning. The developed iterative optimization procedure will be combined under Python programming language to facilitate implementation to commercial molecular dynamics packages. From a statistical point of view, the idea of divide-and-conquer and design-based subsample aggregation to reduce computational complexity of Gaussian process modeling is innovative. It can open a new path in statistics/data science with big data settings and can lead to advances in machine learning and optimization. The sequential optimization framework constructed for high-dimensional problems may open new avenues for studying problems with massive and complex input structure and energize both theoretical and applied research in statistics and machine learning.<br/><br/>The award is jointly funded through the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the current era of big data, machine learning algorithms have set themselves apart as excellent, accurate tools for modeling complex systems and predicting future outcomes. Determining why those particular algorithms actually work and how those predictions are generated has proven to be a much greater challenge, yet understanding these aspects is crucial for practical scientific use. For example, if an algorithm predicts that you are at risk for a particular disease, you will instinctively care less about the exact percentage chance you have of getting it and much more about why you are more likely to get it and whether there is something you could do to prevent getting it. This work will develop tools that allow scientists to more easily determine which variables most affect an algorithm's performance and whether some other collection of variables might offer an alternative but equally accurate explanation for the outcomes predicted.

The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of mathematical and algorithmic tools that can harness the information content of large datasets acquired from experiments and observations to create coherent representations of complex systems, and use these representations to perform prediction, and ultimately, control.

Recently, a new tool called the diffusion forecast has been developed based on provably consistent estimators, which learn the unknown structure of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems on manifolds.  Moreover, the results of many published numerical experiments indicate that this framework can be applied far beyond the restricted context of the current theory.  In particular, the evidence suggests that the consistency proofs can be extended to non-autonomous projections of complex systems, deterministic chaotic systems represented by non-compact operators, non-smooth domains such as fractal attractors, and even generalized tensors on metric-measure spaces.

With collective efforts from statistics, computer science, and optimization, a large toolbox has been developed to efficiently make an update to the model based on one data point at a time, whereas much less is explored about how to quantify uncertainty of the predictions in these online learning problems. For example, to what extent can we trust the predictions of an online learning algorithm, and how different would the predictions be by updating the model with more data?

For example, the data may have structure such as graphs, functions, strings, and sets, but is not Euclidean. To analyze these data sets and address various statistical applications arising in these fields, efficient learning and inference procedures that can handle high-dimensional and non-standard data are needed. The functional analytic paradigm involving reproducing kernels, also known as the kernel method, provides a unified framework to handle such data and has been applied to a variety of non-parametric statistical problems with great empirical success by the machine learning community. However, its theoretical understanding in terms of statistical optimality has been limited, and computationally it scales poorly to large data. The key focus of this project is to explore various foundational research questions associated with the kernel method to achieve a statistically optimal and computationally efficient paradigm that can handle high-dimensional non-standard data. This research will significantly impact scientific development in all areas of science and engineering that intersect with statistics, and will be integrated with the PI's  educational activities of mentoring students, developing new courses and forging new collaborations. Methods and code developed under this project will be made publicly available for ready use. <br/><br/>The core idea behind the kernel method is to map the observed data (could be high-dimensional and non-standard) to exotic function space, called the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and apply the standard methods developed for Euclidean data on the mapped data. Ironically, the RKHS is usually higher dimensional (even infinite-dimensional) than the dimensionality of the observed data, and is characterized by a kernel function called the reproducing kernel. The main advantage of the kernel method is its ability to explore nonlinear relationships in data by simply exploring linear relationships between the mapped elements in the RKHS through the kernel function. Despite its superior empirical performance, the statistical theory of learning algorithms based on the kernel method is not well understood except in a few cases such as classification, non-parametric least square regression, principal component analysis and goodness-of-fit testing. In tise project, the PI will explore various foundational research questions associated with the kernel method and associated learning algorithms to address this gap. The project consists of four related research themes that overall seek to deepen the mathematical understanding of the kernel method so as to exploit its full power in constructing inference procedures that can efficiently handle non-standard data. The project will also shed light on the advantages and limitations of the kernel method over other non-parametric methods in the literature. The aims are to (i) Develop statistical optimality results for kernel-based hypothesis tests and non-linear canonical correlation analysis, (ii) Develop computational vs. statistical trade-off analysis for various kernel learning procedures using approximation schemes such as Nystrom method, random features and their variations, that speed up these procedures, (iii) Develop new methodologies with concrete mathematical guarantees using the kernel method for learning and inference on functions and probability distributions, with applications in functional data analysis, and (iv) Generalize the kernel method using multi-scale kernels to obtain wavelet-like representations and investigate its statistical and computational behaviors in various learning procedures. Overall, the project will develop a comprehensive mathematical theory for computationally efficient kernel-based learning algorithms with applications in statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop new analytical tools to improve conventional methods by delivering more informative and interpretable scientific findings. The developed transfer learning algorithms, which can reliably extract and combine knowledge from diverse data types and across different studies, will help address important issues from genomics applications.

We aim to develop a general framework to gain understanding of the benefits and caveats of transfer learning in a wide range of large-scale inference problems including sparse estimation, false discovery rate analysis, sparse linear discriminant analysis and high-dimensional regression. Our research addresses two key issues in transfer learning: (a) What should be transferred? (b) How to transfer and prevent negative learning? We aim to pursue three major research goals. The first is to develop a class of computationally efficient and robust transfer learning algorithms for high-dimensional sparse inference. The general strategy is to first learning the local sparsity structure of the high-dimensional object through auxiliary data and then apply the structural knowledge to the target domain by adaptively placing differential weights or setting varied thresholds on corresponding coordinates. The second is to formalize a decision-theoretic framework for high-dimensional transfer learning that is applicable across the sparse and non-sparse regimes. Along this direction, we aim to develop a class of kernelized nonparametric empirical Bayes methods for data-sharing shrinkage estimation and multiple testing. The third is to address the urgent needs and new challenges arising from important genomics applications using the newly developed methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Singlet fission (SF) is the conversion of one photogenerated singlet exciton into two triplet excitons. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in SF thanks to its potential to significantly increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by harvesting two charge carriers from one photon. However, few materials are presently known to exhibit intermolecular SF with high efficiency, hindering the realization of solid-state SF-based solar cells. The chemical compound space of possible chromophores is infinitely vast and largely unexplored. To enable computational discovery of SF materials, a new multi-fidelity screening approach will be developed, which integrates quantum mechanical simulations at different levels of fidelity with machine learning (ML) and database mining. ML algorithms will be used to analyze data generated by quantum mechanical simulations and to steer simulations for further data acquisition. High-cost high-fidelity evaluations of excited state properties of solid-state forms of candidate chromophores will be performed with many-body perturbation theory methods within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Lower-cost lower-fidelity evaluations of ground state features will be performed with density functional theory. Feature selection algorithms will then determine which descriptors are most predictive of the thermodynamic driving force for SF. These descriptors will be used to screen databases that contain crystal structures with no information or only partial information on their electronic properties. Optimization algorithms will be employed to decide which data points to sample and at what level of fidelity to maximize information gain. This research will advance the discovery of new intermolecular SF chromophores and will lead to advances in data science in the area of experimental design.  <br/><br/>The award is jointly funded through the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly, clustering methods which discover latent structure in data are our primary tool for navigating, exploring and visualizing massive datasets. These methods have been widely and successfully applied in phylogeny, medicine, psychiatry, archaeology and anthropology, phytosociology, economics and several other fields. Despite its ubiquity, the widespread scientific adoption of clustering methods have been hindered by the lack of flexible clustering methods for high-dimensional datasets and by the dearth of meaningful inferential guarantees in clustering problems. Accordingly, the goal of this research is to develop new and effective methods for clustering complex data-sets, and to further develop an inferential grounding -- which will in turn lead to actionable conclusions -- for these methods. This research will lead to the development of new clustering methods, as well as to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limitations of methods aimed at uncovering latent structure in data. <br/><br/>The research component of this project consists of four aims designed to address related aspects of this high-level goal: (a) analyze and develop new clustering methods for high-dimensional datasets, with a particular focus on practically useful methods like mixture-model based clustering, and minimum volume clustering; (b) develop novel methods for inference in the context of clustering, motivated by scientific applications where it is important not only to cluster the data but also to clearly characterize the sampling variability of the discovered clusters; (c) develop fundamental lower bounds for high-dimensional clustering (d) develop novel methods for clustering functional data with inferential guarantees. These research components are closely coupled with concrete educational initiatives, including the development and broad dissemination of publicly-available software for high-dimensional clustering; tutorials and workshops at Machine Learning conferences and fostering further interactions between the Departments of Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon."

Proteins, the intricate molecular machines that perform the majority of functions necessary to sustain life, are made up of combinations of molecular building blocks known as amino acids, arrayed in long chains. Nature provides twenty different amino acid molecules, and variations in the sequence in which they are chained together leads proteins to adopt diverse three-dimensional folded shapes. These folded shapes, in turn, dictate protein function. In recent years, researchers have shown that a variety of artificial protein backbones, where some of the natural amino acids are replaced by different molecules of approximately the same size, can fold to adopt complex protein-like shapes. Artificial backbones have fundamental value in helping understand how proteins work and also offer practical benefits over their natural counterparts. Small proteins currently find widespread use as agents for the diagnosis and treatment of disease; however, an important limitation to such application is rapid degradation by enzymes that are abundant in the bloodstream. Changing the backbone while keeping side chains intact can create a molecule that mimics the folded shape and biological function of a prototype natural protein but is less prone to degradation in the body. A crucial component in the design of artificial backbones with predictable shapes is understanding how they fold. This project seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which artificial backbones fold through closely-coupled experiments and computational modeling.  This work includes the development of a new force field---the mathematical model describing interactions among the natural and artificial amino acids---for the modeling component of the research.  The force field will be disseminated as open source through the widely-used AMBER molecular dynamics simulation package.  This interdisciplinary, collaborative project is providing a valuable training ground for graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and is supporting diverse educational and outreach activities, including a summer undergraduate creative science writing workshop, guest lectures on issues related to scientific research and science communication, and a three-week workshop on Python coding at a local high school. The creative science writing workshop is being designed and offered by the Chemistry, English, and the History and Philosophy of Science Departments at the University of Pittsburgh, and provides students with joint science and writing mentorship, culminating in submission of one or more capstone pieces for publication in news outlets with broad readership.<br/><br/>A key recent advance that pushed the frontier of structural complexity possible in protein mimetics is the finding that backbone connectivity can be substantially altered without compromising the fold specified by a natural side-chain sequence. Compared to the growing body of structural information on such ""heterogeneous-backbone"" protein mimics, virtually nothing is known about how backbone alteration impacts dynamics or folding pathways. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential to reveal new insights into the folding behavior in artificial backbones, aid in the design of more effective protein mimics, and provide insights into fundamental issues related to natural protein folding. This project is determining how protein backbone connectivity influences chain dynamics and folding mechanisms. The research is guided by the central hypothesis that a combination of experimental biophysical analysis and atomistic computer simulations can reveal the complex interplay among backbone composition, folded structure, chain dynamics, solvation, and folding pathways.  The project includes the design and parameterization of a modified AMBER force field for simulating folding and molecular recognition events involving artificial protein-like backbones, and the development of novel protocols for simulating protein folding processes using the weighted ensemble enhanced sampling strategy. The force field is being disseminated as part of the AMBER molecular dynamics package. The new simulation strategies are being used to model the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetics experiments performed on corresponding protein mimetics synthesized in the PI's lab. This unique combination of experimental and computational research is providing insights into the molecular origins of stability differences between natural proteins and artificial counterparts, folding behavior in artificial-backbone protein mimetics, and the fundamental role of backbone preorganization in protein folding.  The project is providing research training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in state-of-the-art protein design and modeling.  An undergraduate Creative Science Summer Program at the University of Pittsburgh is being expanded, enabling students to develop valuable writing skills in the sciences, to communicate the critical roles that science plays in society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is thus imperative to develop new clustering methods to meet the ever-increasing challenges of data with high complexity, huge volume, and from distributed sources. In this project, novel statistical and optimization-based approaches and software packages will be developed to address these challenges. Graduate students will be trained to conduct research at the forefront of machine learning.

Furthermore, a big data environment can require the integration of clustering results at distributed sites, a problem called multi-source clustering. This research will advance cluster analysis from multiple aspects. First, hidden Markov model on variable blocks (HMM-VB), a special Gaussian mixture model (GMM), is developed to tackle high dimensionality. The estimation of HMM-VB will be enhanced by computationally efficient methods to identify the latent variable block structure and by mixture factor analyzers. Second, leveraging the latent states of HMM-VB, a new variable selection approach will be developed for clustering high-dimensional data.

Astronomers' current best understanding of cosmology comes from using a certain type of exploding stars<br/>(supernovae) to ""map"" the Universe.  However, a fundamental tenet of science is that results should be tested and confirmed with independent methods.  This investigation thus seeks to determine if another type of astronomical object can be used to test current theories.  These objects are black holes that lurk in the cores of all massive galaxies, some of which are actively ""feeding"" today and are called ""quasars"".  Ultimately the goal is to attempt to determine if a sub-class of quasars can be used in the same way as supernovae to map the geometry of the universe.  In this process a graduate student will be trained in modern data science methods and both the student and PI will support education and public outreach, through activities involving Drexel's Lynch Observatory, engaging with elementary and middle-school classrooms, and actively working to increase inclusion and diversity at both Drexel University and in the science community in general.<br/><br/>This project has potential for advancing science because known quasars vastly outnumber the supernovae that are currently the foundation of cosmology and the quasars ""live"" longer in addition to having been discovered across cosmic time.  What one might hope to learn from them would provide independent constraints on existing methods.  This project will undertake a novel method for leveraging machine learning to improve and expand upon the use of quasars for cosmology.  The work involves calibrating two relationships that can be applied to up to 500,000 known quasars and can be accomplished using existing public data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The project is designed as a 1-year high-risk, high potential reward exploratory investigation that the proposing team is uniquely positioned to carry out.

We address the variational study of relevant observed phenomena in nanowires and in the epitaxial deposition of a thin film onto a substrate.  We study phase nucleation in Lithium-Ion batteries, which are central to advances in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage; phase nucleation is important in understanding charge-discharge dynamics (poor cycle life) and other material limitations of these batteries.  In what concerns the mathematics of imaging, we pursue the analytical investigation of image processing, restoration, and registration, which are fundamental to the advance of computer vision, medical imaging, film restoration, and scanning probe microscopy.  These projects offer opportunities for integrating research in applied analysis with the education of advanced graduate students at the interface between mathematics and the physical sciences and engineering.  Graduate students participate in the research of the project.<br/><br/>What unifies these topics is that underlying energies involve higher order derivatives in spaces with discontinuous admissible fields, multiple scales interact, bulk and surface energies compete, and degeneracy of usually expected properties prevails.  Together, these difficulties prevent the use of well-understood mathematical theories, and require new ideas and the introduction of innovative mathematical tools.  Contemporary methods in the calculus of variations and nonlinear partial differential equations are used to study quasi-static (elliptic) and evolution (parabolic) systems of equations in a range of problems arising in materials science that span epitaxy, batteries, nanowires, and phase transitions.

Alloys are often more effective catalysts than the pure elements from which they are derived because their properties can be tuned by varying their elemental composition.  However, this tuning poses a challenging research problem because it can require the preparation and testing of hundreds of different compositions to find the optimal catalyst.  With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Dr. Andrew Gellman at Carnegie Mellon University is developing and applying methods for the acceleration of such research by measuring catalytic reactions over many alloy compositions concurrently.  These data are providing a comprehensive understanding of the influence of alloy composition on catalytic reaction rates and selectivities.  In addition, these data are being used to develop machine learning models to predict the catalytic properties of new alloys and identify likely candidates for further testing and study.

In the existing statistical literature, most of theory aims at understanding the average or global behavior of a statistical estimator in high dimensions. In many applications, however, it is often the case that the goal is not to explore the global behavior of a parameter estimator, but rather to perform inference and reasoning on its local, yet important, operational properties.  The techniques and methods developed in the project will further advance the interplay between a broad range of areas including high-dimensional statistics, harmonic analysis, statistical physics, optimization, complex analysis, and statistical machine learning. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>This project pursues fine-grained inferential procedures and theory, aimed at enlarging the uncertainty assessment toolbox for various low-complexity models in high dimensions. Focusing on a few stylized problems, this research program consists of four major thrusts: (1) construct optimal confidence intervals for linear functionals of eigenvectors in low-rank matrix estimation; (2) design fine-grained hypothesis testing procedures for sparse regression under general designs; (3) develop entry-wise inference schemes for principal component analysis with missing data; and (4) conduct reliable and adaptive statistical eigen-analysis under minimal eigen-gaps. Emphasis is placed on algorithms that are model-agnostic and fully adaptive to data heteroscedasticity.

Sometimes, due to certain underlying fundamental properties such as symmetry or independence of these objects, we witness an order and universality present in high dimensions. This project aims to deepen our mathematical understanding of such phenomena in several contexts, such as volumetric aspects of high-dimensional random polytopes (geometric objects with ""flat"" sides), or the sums of many random quantities in which each quantity comes with a deterministic weight. In addition to their fundamental interest, such problems are motivated by, and often find applications in, related areas of statistics, computer science, big data and machine learning. A vital part of this project is the student training and educational activities that will result. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project is devoted to three topics related to analytic, geometric and probabilistic aspects of high-dimensional phenomena: estimates for moments and tails of sums of random variables, thresholds for the volume of random polytopes, and efficient coverings of convex sets with its homothetic copies (the Hadwiger covering/illumination problem). Our work on probabilistic comparison inequalities, involving analytic and probabilistic techniques such as chaining, will help us understand the concentration of measure phenomena for random sums, with applications to the geometry of Banach spaces. Volume threshold phenomena of random polytopes in high dimensions have been established and satisfactorily understood only in the presence of a product structure or rotational symmetry. The lack of these two in our problems creates a need for new, more robust techniques and approaches.

Naturally, any use of human genomic data raises grave privacy concerns. This is because the power to query multiple genomic databases with seemingly innocuous questions such as ""Do you contain any genome that has mutation X?"" is enough to determine whether an individual's genome is present in the databases. Such re-identification attacks have raised a germane question: can one implement privacy protection for genomic data so that meaningful data analysis remains possible, but attacks such as these become impossible? The main idea of this project is to achieve this goal by making and exploiting statistical assumptions about the data, such that if the assumptions are false, data analysis will suffer but privacy will not. The project will also generate curricular material for a graduate class at the intersection of data privacy, machine learning, and genomics.<br/><br/>The project considers three major research questions on preserving privacy in the context of genomic data. The notion of privacy used is differential privacy, which provably protects against re-identification attacks, and has found large-scale adoption in both academia and industry. The first research question is the estimation of allele frequencies, and of linkage disequilibrium, while preserving individual privacy. Given a set of human genomes, the objective of allele frequency estimation is to estimate the frequency of the different mutations across various locations in the chromosome. Linkage disequilibrium is the deviation from independence for pairs of alleles. The second question is haplotype sampling. Haplotypes correspond to sets of genetic variations (typically extending over multiple genes), that tend to be inherited together.  In haplotype sampling, the objective is to generate synthetic haplotypes given a data set of human genomes, while respecting biology behind these genetic variations. Finally, the project aims to estimate pathogenic variants of breast cancer genes. Variants of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes are known to be pathogenic for breast cancer. However, a lot of the variants are still not classified as pathogenic / non-pathogenic and are VUSs - Variants of Unknown Significance. The objective is to develop a privacy-preserving system to gather statistics about the VUSs from individually sequenced genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project builds upon a recent breakthrough that stems from thinking of the system as analogous to a particle rolling downhill on an abstract energy landscape.  That is, the seemingly complicated motion of the individual bubbles in a foam, when projected into this abstract space, resembles the twists and turns of a river canyon.  The PIs will seek to better understand the shape of the landscape that causes the 'river' to twist and turn as it does, to make new versions of the model that give rise to 'rivers' having different shapes and to add real-world detail to the model.  Similar 'landscape' approaches have also been found to be useful in machine learning algorithms with many applications, suggesting that the algorithms we develop and our findings may find useful application outside the field of Materials Research.

It will build upon recent studies using a foam model that show that the unusual mechanics of soft glassy materials - power-law rheology, super-diffusive particle motion and avalanches - are due to fractal properties of the system?s path in configuration space.  Specifically, it will extend the model to capture the effects of viscous damping and applied shear, produce models having configuration paths with different fractal dimensions as well as probe the fractal geometry of the energy landscape itself.  The net result is the development of a suite of tools for the actuation of non-equilibrium systems to probe and understand the geometry of energy landscapes and its relation to material properties.  More broadly, it appears that the behavior of many complex adaptive systems, including the cells in our bodies, may be determined by the minimization of some very complex energy or fitness landscape embedded in a high-dimensional space, whose in-depth study is only now becoming practical due to advances in computation. This interdisciplinary project will provide ample opportunity for graduate and undergraduate student training in the development of state of the art tools for studying such high-dimensional energy and fitness landscapes.  The tools developed in this proposal will be disseminated openly, and we anticipate them finding utility outside of material science."

For example in marketing, the statistician may be interested in learning the purchasing behavior of consumers from an analysis of a database of consumer transactions that includes various consumer descriptors (e.g. age, income level, geographic location) as well as  purchase amounts. The statistician would then typically attempt to build a mathematical model that characterizes the relationship between the consumer descriptors and the expenditure amount.  In doing so, however, certain issues bear strongly on the model's value and effectiveness.  First, the validity of a model may strongly depend on prior assumptions about the nature of the modeled process, information that can be difficult to ascertain. For instance, a consumer behavior model which builds in a simple assumption that consumers with higher income levels are always expected to purchase more, may be inadvertently ignoring subtleties that violate this assumption when other factors are simultaneously taken into account.  Second, sometimes even a valid and effective model may be such a complicated object that the extraction of meaningful information can itself be very challenging.  For example, after establishing particular set of predictors as important drivers of consumer purchasing power, it will still be of key interest how to best measure their relative importance in the model.  Focusing on the powerful and flexible approach of Bayesian regression tree ensemble modeling, the main thrust of this project will be to innovate this methodology to address these and other modeling avenues.  This new methodology will enable practitioners to address their research questions in an assumption-lean framework that allows the ensemble models to make use of their data to adaptively and flexibly incorporate contextual modeling assumptions. To greatly enhance interpretability, it will also provide automatic, information based summaries of variable importance to help the practitioner understand and interpret the available descriptor information.  In addition to these and further methodological contributions, the project will develop software for the implementation of this methodology as a freely available R package, enabling practitioners to more easily leverage our developments in their practical work. This is where the graduate student supported by this award will help. <br/><br/><br/>The research will focus on three general innovations to Bayesian ensemble modeling to further enhance its ability to extract meaning from complex data within an assumption lean framework.    The first contribution will develop theoretically valid measures of variable importance.  These measures will provide computationally efficient calculation of indices which meaningfully gauge the relative importance of predictor variables, both marginally and in terms of interactions.  The second contribution will provide an approach to monotone shape constrained inference which does not require any prior assumption of monotonicity.  This multidimensional nonparametric regression approach will enable the discovery and estimation of any and all the monotone components of the regression function, and to do so with no constraint assumptions whatsoever.  The third contribution will vastly extend the applicability of Bayesian ensemble modeling by developing a generalization of BART for arbitrary response data distributions, such as dichotomous responses and count data.  This major technical innovation will be based on a conjugacy-free formulation that will extend the reach of BART to many new application areas and problem types than were previously possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past decades, regularization methods such as Lasso, SCAD, and MCP have been proposed to conduct model estimation in the presence of high dimensional covariates. Various numerical algorithms have been developed for these methods, and their theoretical properties are well studied. However, questions of how to efficiently and effectively utilize high-dimensional data to make optimal decisions and conduct inference are relatively less studied, although such problems are of vital practical importance. This project will develop new methods and theories for making optimal decisions and conducting valid inference under high-dimensional settings. The methods have wide applications, for instance, in personalized medicine where the goal is to determine the optimal treatments for a patient based on predictor information, including several thousand genetic markers.

In this problem, the player sequentially chooses one action and observes a reward, where the goal is to maximize the reward. The principal investigators will develop a new algorithm to provide an optimal decision rule, which achieves the minimax optimal regret. The second aim is to study general inference problems that arise from high-dimensional stochastic convex optimization, where the goal is to quantify the uncertainties of the optimal objective value. The third goal is to consider the general stochastic linear bandit problem with a finite and random action space.

In order to extract concrete information from such systems, suitable mathematical models must be designed so as to capture the most relevant cross-scale interactions and degrees of freedom. In this project the PI will investigate the efficiency of methods for exploring complex system models under two main perspectives. First, through techniques of statistical inference of physical quantities based on observational data. Several applications fit within this scope, for example determining the background fluid velocity field from measurements of the concentration of a diluted passive scalar, such as dye. A second application is the analysis of the long-time behavior of computable regularizations of certain hydrodynamics models. More specifically, geophysical models describing the motion of fluids over a rough surface and used to represent large-scale processes in the atmosphere and ocean. A rigorous analysis of such fundamental questions encompasses a wide range of mathematical tools. As such, the techniques built here may allow for the development of efficient numerical schemes in numerous applications, as well as the advancement of the associated mathematical theory. In addition, this project presents an educational component by including support for the mentoring of one graduate student, as well as undergraduate research co-op support for one undergraduate student.<br/><br/>A rigorous and complete description of complex systems requires an analysis at an infinite-dimensional level. In this project the PI will this infinite-dimensional approach to analyze the efficiency of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, as used in the Bayesian approach to inverse problems. Of particular importance are MCMC algorithms that are well-defined in infinite dimensions, a property that allows corresponding finite-dimensional approximations to beat the curse of dimensionality. This project will tackle several open questions in this field, such as the derivation of mixing rates for some infinite-dimensional MCMC methods and their corresponding finite-dimensional approximations. The techniques to be used here rely crucially on Foias-Prodi type estimates and the existence of a finite number of determining degrees of freedom for certain dissipative evolution equations. Furthermore, this project includes the study of the long-time behavior of certain hydrodynamic models, such as the weakly damped 2D Euler equations subject to a mild regularization. In particular, this will first be addressed through the concept of determining forms, structures encoding the long-time dynamics of the system based on knowledge on the trajectories of only a finite number of degrees of freedom. Later, the system will be analyzed under the action of a stochastic forcing term. Here, an interesting question consists in establishing the convergence of invariant measures as the regularization parameter vanishes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As two examples, flow predictions are key to limiting damage of hurricanes to human life and to the economy (the latter estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars in 2017) and to energy efficiency optimization (85% of US energy is generated by combustion for which accurate simulation of turbulent mixing is critical). Unfortunately, fundamental barriers to accurate, efficient and reliable prediction of fluid flow exist in these and other applications addressed in the proposed research. Accurate prediction with uncertain data requires reliable and efficient ensemble simulations. The cost of current methods limits prediction accuracy by limiting ensemble sizes. Further improvement requires new computational tools with a fundamental decrease in simulation cost and memory requirements. Algorithms which address these needs will be developed in this project. <br/><br/>Artificial compression methods are by far the most efficient per time step but little used due to low time accuracy, restrictive time step conditions, stability problems, ill-conditioning and nonphysical acoustic waves. Their resolution will resurrect artificial compression methods into accurate, reliable and efficient methods for the prediction of fluid motion, expanding ensemble simulations and coupled flow prediction markedly beyond their current limitations. Artificial compression methods exhibit parasitic pressure waves that become resonant at higher Reynolds numbers. This research will develop a method dependent Lighthill theory of flow generated sound and apply it to design time filters to suppress parasitic acoustics. Time accuracy will be achieved by development of a new family of variable step, variable order methods. Variable step, variable order method have proven to be the most efficient, accurate and reliable methods to solve smaller systems of ordinary differential equations.  However, previous variable step, variable order methods have limited penetration into computational fluid dynamics practice due partially to their implementation complexity and increased cost per step. The new methods have (to leading order) the same cognitive and computational complexity as the fully implicit method. Uncoupling of velocity and pressure in artificial compression methods introduces an extra grad-div term in the velocity solve, decreasing sparsity and increasing ill conditioning. Thus, the efficiency of artificial compression methods is lost with increased storage and solver cost per step. The research will develop a new realization, modular Grad-Div, reducing storage and turnaround time by a factor of 30 in preliminary tests. While each development has independent interest, they will be integrated into an ensemble, artificial compression method and tested on problems of compelling interest. The proposed research develops expertise of PhD students in analysis, numerical analysis and application areas while working on compelling mathematics problems of broad impact advancing the accurate prediction of fluid motion.

At a glance, eukaryotic organelles could be described as small intracellular compartments delineated from the rest of the cell content by a membrane made up of molecules called lipids.  The organelles are critical for the life of the cell and in turn their formation depends on the self-assembly of the lipids into membranes and on the coexistence of different liquid phases. Consequently the lipid self-assembly and the coexistence of liquid-liquid phases are the object of on-going investigations. In contrast, the interactions between these two processes are largely unexplored. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems are funding Dr. Christine Keating from Penn State University and Dr. Kate Adamala from the University of Minnesota to investigate how the two main types of intracellular organizational processes interact with each other.

In vitro lipid biosynthesis pathways are developed for in situ lipid generation in model cytoplasm. The self-assembly of these lipids in the presence of model membraneless organelles is characterized by optical and electron microscopies as well as by permeability measurements. This project seeks to engineer artificial cells capable of producing functional synthetic lipid membranes and inducible stress granules.

In this study, a novel device concept based on new materials is being explored to replace traditional silicon-based transistors, with the goal of lowering the operating power. Specifically, a new type of polymer electrolyte (i.e., ion conducting polymer) is designed to induce strain in a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor when an electric field is applied. The 2D semiconductor has a thickness of only one molecule. The strain changes the electrical properties of the 2D semiconductor, which can then be sensed to perform logic operations. The change is predicted to occur at voltages lower than ones used in conventional transistors, and therefore the power required to operate the device is lower. In addition to applications in nanoelectronics, this research advances new materials for phase change devices that respond to electrical, chemical or strain stimuli, with potential application in brain-inspired computing, and artificial synapses. The postdoctoral scholar, graduate and undergraduate students who work on this project benefit from an interdisciplinary project that combines chemistry, polymer science, inorganic materials science and device physics with the goal of engineering low-power transistors. The research component provides educational case studies to be used in the classroom, and interdisciplinary training of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Technical Description:  A new approach to strain 2D crystals is being explored using a field-effect transistor (FET) with a suspended MoTe2 channel for which the gate oxide is replaced by a custom-synthesized ionomer (i.e., single-ion conductor). Gate bias induces an electrostatic imbalance in the ionomer that strains the 2D crystal and induces a semiconducting to metallic phase change. The phase change is detected by the current-voltage characteristics of the FET, and is expected to occur at sub-volt gate bias with nanosecond switching times. This approach offers a gate control architecture that is similar to conventional CMOS architecture but with new materials and new physics. The research addresses both a fundamental and a practical challenge for dynamically controlling the phase behavior of 2D crystals. The fundamental challenge is achieving strain in 2D crystals that is sufficiently large to induce the phase transition; here, electrostatic control via ions is used to address this challenge. The practical challenge is building an electronic device that can exploit this phase-change property for low-power transistors, brain-inspired computing, or the development of artificial synapses."

Among these anticipated revolutions is that in sensor technology, affecting a wide array of devices regularly used to detect and measure everything from electric currents, magnetic and gravitational fields, and light intensities, to name a few examples. The key element driving these developments is quantum entanglement, the strange correlations between observable properties of even widely-separated quantum systems. While entanglement is ubiquitous in quantum systems, it is also extremely delicate, and can be altered or spoiled by interactions of the quantum system with its environment. This delicacy is precisely what makes exquisitely controlled quantum systems the source of potentially revolutionary sensor technology. This project concerns simple sensors formed by entangled ultracold atoms confined in ring-shaped traps. The ring-shape allows for the interference of counter-propagating matter waves, forming a kind of interferometer which has exquisite sensitivity to interactions between the atoms. Additional applications of the results to quantum information processing and to new quantum materials will also be explored. The PI will actively train and involve numerous undergraduate students in physics research at a low cost university, and expand on success under prior grants to leverage this experience to channel students into STEM career paths, including many from under-represented demographics. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project will conduct a comprehensive study of phenomena realizable with ultracold atoms trapped in lattices with a global topology that is multiply-connected, such as rings, cylinders or tori. The non-trivial topology naturally introduces periodic and twisted boundary conditions with the inclusion of effective flux via gauge fields or rotation, and reveals coherent and non-local features of quantum states. Within this general context, a broad range of topics will be examined. Models with ring-shaped geometry have played a crucial role in understanding the influences of topology and gauge freedoms in non-relativistic physics. This research will develop and extend those models for viable implementation with cold atoms to probe scenarios often inaccessible when such models were conceived. The phenomena to be so studied will include artificial gauge fields, quantum Hall effect, anyon physics, quantum pumps, Hofstadter model, and Aharonov-Bohm and geometric phase effects. Spin-squeezing, that can bypass uncertainty limits, and nonlinear dynamics will be examined in the novel context of counter-circulating collective modes of atoms sharing the same physical space. Where possible, the phenomena will be examined dynamically with evolution in time and space, noting that time can add or substitute for other degrees of freedom. Treating rings as artificial atoms, counterparts will be established in external degrees of freedom for phenomena usually associated with internal ones."

For decades, researchers have been trying to increase the strength of coupling between light and matter by engineering artificial dielectric structures (like silicon or glass) to be in resonance with incoming light.  Nearly all such structures have been patterns that are periodically repeating in space: a kind of microscopic scaffolding.  One of the principal goals of this project is to show that certain non-periodic structures with no repeating units can facilitate stronger light-matter coupling than periodic designs.

Consequently, biomaterials with structure and function tunable by shear represent powerful tools to detect and rectify pathological processes induced by abnormal flows in the body. For the past few decades, shear-responsive hydrogels and molecular assemblies have been widely explored. However, single-biomolecule based shear responders remains a poorly-tapped subject, despite such materials could better mimic natural functions in circulation, delivering more accurate spatial and temporal responses with function reversibility. This project will design and characterize novel Single-MOlecule based materials with switchable structures and functions REsponsive to Shear flows (SMORES). Owing to the modular design, the material concept can be generalized to other constructs capable of responding to abnormal flows in the circulatory system towards novel diagnostics and therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases in the long term. This project will provide fundamental insights into biomechanics of polymer devices under the influence of ligands and the flow environment, perspectives that have not been studied in depth before. Rational design of biomaterials containing both bio- and nonbio- functionalities to achieve predictable flow responses will advance the fields of materials science, biomechanics, bio-conjugation, molecular engineering and bio-transport. Knowledge from this work will enable new diagnostics and theranostics for hemostatic applications, advancing the national health. The PIs will actively recruit underrepresented students to their research and disseminated discoveries from the research broadly to the general public through various K12 outreach programs.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: The design is inspired by a coagulation molecule in circulation, the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which executes its function of crosslinking platelets to damaged blood vessel wall at shear rates > 5,000 per sec. The function is switched on by conformational changes under high shear and is enabled by an extremely complicated molecular structure: vWF is comprised of tens to hundreds of monomer units, each of which contains more than ten domains. To demonstrate that an artificial material of modular design could achieve a similar function to vWF, i.e. binding cells at high shear, we propose the construction SMORES to inhibit or promote the cell binding activity of the vWF?s platelet binding domain under shear control. Shear dependent cell binding to the proposed material will be characterized and correlated with molecular conformations studied by single-molecular force spectroscopy, microfluidic imaging experiments and computer modeling. Besides demonstrating the material design concept, the proposed work will emphasize fundamental studies of single-molecule biomechanical behaviors in different biochemical environment, especially the presence and absence of ligands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.<br/><br/>Demand for wireless broadband has soared due to technological innovation, such as 4G mobile services, and the rapid increase in wireless internet. This demand would require the utilization of frequencies over a bandwidth that has been traditionally slated for radio telescopes. This frequency infringement may interfere with reception and interpretation of astronomical data and, as such, compromise the search and discoveries of extraterrestrial intelligence. The project puts forward coexistence strategies where wireless users cause minimum interference to astronomical observations. <br/><br/>The project aims at achieving the coexistence strategies by developing interference mitigation techniques that factor in the high-elevation of the look direction of the telescope compared to low-elevation angles of signals emitted by base-stations and wireless systems. A co-existence strategy calls for authorized broadcast stations and wireless transmitters to cooperate with radio telescopes by reporting their locations and providing properties of their signal structures. Prior knowledge of interference location simplifies its nulling and removal by telescope array of multiple units. On the other hand, the distinction in signal characteristics between astronomical events and those of digital communications enables effective cooperative as well as non-cooperative interference identification and suppression.  The project has the potential to advance spectrum sharing and utilization and therefore enhance the future capacity for U.S. industry and academic institutions in this area of research and development."

By learning the relationships between syllables and words, or scientific and mathematical concepts, we produce language, form lexical knowledge, develop physical intuition, exercise logical deduction, and attain expertise in our line of work. Collectively, these relational data can be described as a graph in which nodes might represent syllables or concepts, and edges might represent shared content or conditional probabilities. Yet, how the organization of such a graph impacts our ability to learn the data or the neural processes that affect learning is far from understood. In this project the PI will use network science as a mathematical framework within which she will study the human learning of relational patterns, and answer the question of whether graphs that are complex in the mathematical or naturalistic senses are more or less difficult to learn, or require different neural processes. To facilitate broader impacts, these efforts incorporate art to transform STEM to STEAM, a recent international innovation that improves long-term retention of content and scientific reasoning. The goals of this program are (i) to create a local community - from preschoolers to adults - who are generally inspired by cutting edge science, and who more specifically appreciate the concepts of network architectures in natural information and in their brain?s ability to learn that information, (ii) to produce undergraduate and graduate students trained at the interdisciplinary boundary between network science and neuroscience to address critical and timely scientific questions that transcend national boundaries, (iii) to develop course material that incorporates these timely research questions, and (iv) to polish and release teaching materials developed in these aims to international and global collaborators, and to the public.

Exploratory work seeks to translate the knowledge gained in these areas to instructed learning of scientific concepts. In this proposal, the PI brings together her background in theoretical physics and network science, her expertise in multimodal human neuroimaging, her current research program intersecting engineering and cognitive neuroscience, and her recently developed methods to predict individual differences in learning from the dynamics of human brain functional connectivity to determine how the graph topology of relational information maps to individual differences in human learning behavior as produced by dissociable neurophysiological processes."

The approach appeals to an approximation within another theoretical formulation of the quantum mechanical description of many interacting particles that would be computationally very expensive to evaluate. The approximation is known as the random phase approximation. The PI's method should have a higher accuracy and be computationally inexpensive compared to many currently existing methods. It should also enable higher accuracy calculations of systems in which the configuration of electrons leads to a higher energy than the lowest or ground state energy of the system.

The PI has two goals through this project: <br/>(1) To develop a computationally efficient correction to the ground-state correlation energy of the random phase approximation. Without a correction, the random phase approximation would not be accurate enough to become a benchmark in chemistry and materials science. Some of the currently existing corrections are accurate, but the price is a high computational cost.<br/>(2) To make the computationally efficient time-dependent density functional theory competitive in accuracy with more complex quantum many-body techniques. Time-dependent density functional theory is an extension of density functional theory to time-dependent potentials. Time-dependent density functional theory has become a very popular tool to compute excitation energies.  It is computationally efficient, but its accuracy is moderate compared to quantum many-body Green's function-based methods. The most commonly used adiabatic local density kernel misses excitonic effects. <br/><br/>The PI will further develop a nonlocal energy-optimized kernel model that is computationally efficient and can capture these effects. Both for ground and excited states the same nonlocal exchange-correlation kernel is to be added to the Coulomb electron-electron interaction kernel in the frequency-dependent linear response function of the ground state. The nonlocal energy-optimized kernel will be applied to molecules and materials. The kernel correction will be tested and applied to many ground-state properties, such as atomization energies, cohesive energies, structural phase transitions, clusters and adsorption problems. The kernel correction to time-dependent density functional theory will be applied to excitation energies including those in semiconductors with a particular focus on photovoltaic materials for solar cell applications.<br/><br/>This award supports an educational activity focused on graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. A thrust of this activity is linked to the TUTeach program which trains high-school teachers. The students in this program are physics majors, who will work as learning assistants for the PI and learn about the PI's research. These students are also outreach ambassadors in the high schools. TUTeach students will work with the PI to deliver computational physics lectures to high-school students. The PI will also mentor students within the local provost's research-experiences-for-undergraduates program. Another significant component of the PI's education program is to develop a new active-learning-based Computational Materials Physics course."

Some of these areas of high societal impact include social and behavioral research, forensic sciences, early detection of covert communications and breaches in data security, early-warning systems for identifying outbreaks of infectious diseases, cognitive development studies in children, and drug discovery, among many others. In many of these areas, commonly-used statistical methods make strong assumptions about the data-generating distribution. Such simplistic approaches may be unjustified; moreover, even if these assumptions make sense, they need to be tested. This research project investigates a powerful alternative to these existing methods and aims to develop a fundamental theoretical understanding of the same, leading to novel statistical applications. Code for algorithms that result from this project will be made publicly available for ready use.<br/><br/>The kernel method is a class of statistical methodology that has gained popularity in statistical learning due to its ability to handle both high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. The core idea of the method is to map observed data to a function space, called the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which allows capture of non-linear relationships in the data. This project concerns theoretical and methodological research on a generalization of this method by embedding probability measures in an RKHS. This generalization has wide applicability in statistical learning problems such as nonparametric hypothesis testing, density estimation, and regression on distributions, which will be explored in this project. On the theoretical front, the characterization of injectivity of kernel embedding will be considered. While such a characterization is well understood for kernels defined on locally compact Abelian groups and compact non-Abelian groups, this project will investigate the injectivity of the kernel embedding for non-standard spaces such as nuclear spaces, the space of graphs, and the positive definite cone. The injectivity of the embedding is known to be related to the richness of the RKHS in approximating a certain class of functions. The research will investigate the rate of this approximation, which turns out to be critical in analyzing the convergence rates of kernel-based regression and density estimators and separation rates in hypothesis testing. An injective embedding induces a metric, called the kernel distance on the space of probabilities, which is defined as the RKHS distance between the kernel embeddings of two probability measures. The investigator will study the relation of kernel distance to other probability metrics such as the energy distance, distance covariance, f-divergence, and integral probability metrics in order to understand the statistical/computational (dis)advantages associated with these distances. These theoretical studies have an applied counterpart, wherein the RKHS embedding plays a critical role in the problems of regression on probability measures and density estimation in infinite dimensional exponential families. For these problems, the investigator plans to develop computationally efficient estimators with theoretical guarantees. Overall, the project aims to develop a comprehensive theory of RKHS embedding of probability measures with applications to problems in statistical learning."

Despite significant advances in the fields of image processing and computer vision, this problem still persists due to the difficulty in accurately modeling random degradations such as noise, pixel loss, and blur. The main objectives for this project are to learn critical geometric and higher order image features for accurately solving a variety of inverse problems in imaging, including image denoising, image deblurring, image inpainting (filling in of missing data), and super-resolution.  The new algorithms developed in this project are expected to yield improvements over existing algorithms in the form of standard image quality metrics as well as in the preservation of accurate, fine details, a feature missing from many current state of the art image processing algorithms, yet vital for automatically interpreting this image data in practice.<br/> <br/>In recent work the PI and collaborators have developed several frameworks for image denoising that attempt to recover an image from a denoised geometric feature of the image. These approaches have successfully improved upon existing state of the art denoising algorithms, providing information in the reconstruction that has been elusive using alternate approaches. The challenge in working with this geometric data is that while it is very robust in practice, mathematically sound mechanisms developed for handling natural image data do not necessarily apply to their geometric features. This project involves learning geometric descriptors from image data that have suffered from some combination of the aforementioned random and/or linear degradations for the purpose of aiding in image reconstruction, analysis, and interpretation. Preliminary analyses and experiments indicate that the benefits of this approach could be significant, yet computationally intensive experiments are required to explore how best to exploit these benefits in practice. Theoretical analyses of these models will be an important part of this project as well, in order to better to understand when these models are guaranteed to be reliable in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is especially exciting in the fields of biology and chemistry where understanding complex molecules may open new avenues, for instance in drug discovery and solar cells, as well as basic research.  A number of physical platforms for quantum computing exist, with two of the leading methods being optical-frequency light interacting with atomic systems (known as quantum optics) and microwave-frequency light interacting with superconducting, Josephson-junction based circuits.  While each method has unique virtues, neither is yet capable of realizing large-scale quantum machines. Further, the two platforms cannot be readily combined in a single quantum circuit due to their vastly different frequencies of operation and materials requirements.  This CAREER project will leverage the extreme flexibility of superconducting circuits to adapt techniques and concepts from quantum optics into a new series of hybrid devices which may be referred to as ""Josephson Quantum Optics"".  This project will produce devices which can power a new generation of quantum machines, as well as support graduate student training in cutting-edge quantum microwave design techniques.  <br/><br/>Superconducting quantum circuits, which combine low-loss superconducting microwave elements with the nonlinear inductance of Josephson junctions, are a leading platform for realizing quantum machines, having made great progress in recent years in demonstrating the basic requirements of quantum computing.  Large scale, error-free quantum computers, however, require encoding their bits of information logically across a number of physical bits so that no single error can destroy them, resulting in a huge expansion in the number of circuit elements required to build a quantum computer.  An architecture in which quantum elements are linked over long distances (a specialty of the field of atomic physics and quantum optics), rather than only to their nearest neighbors, can greatly reduce the hardware overhead required to correct errors.  This project will draw heavily from concepts in optical-frequency quantum optics as well as bath engineering to develop devices which generate and detect novel states of quantum light in ways that are tolerant of loss and circuit imperfections.  Project research aims include the development of dc-driven highly-coherent qubit-based micromasers and an absorptive, highly-efficient Fock-state detector.

The current proposal focuses on those processes that arise naturally in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization. The common features of the proposed problems are simple formulation, fundamental mathematical structure, interesting underlying phenomena and non-trivial impacts on physical disciplines. One main aspect of the proposal is on extreme values for Gaussian processes. An example question is on the geometry of level sets for some spatial processes, and in particular whether one could walk on a random surface while staying on high mountains most of the time.  Another main aspect is on  phase transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems, and an example question is to decide whether there exists an assignment simultaneously satisfying a collection of random boolean formulae.  In addition, the PI intends to apply probability in related areas such as statistical learning and biological evolution. For example, the PI wishes to understand how features of individuals influence the structure of social network and what could be learned about individuals from the network structure.   Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for both graduate students in probability theory, and to develop topic courses that bring probability techniques to students in related areas.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications on a number of stochastic processes in statistical physics and optimization. In the direction of Gaussian processes, the proposal focuses on a number of aspects including the geometry of level sets for two-dimensional Gaussian free fields, an improvement on majorizing measure theory, as well as the connection between Gaussian free fields and random walks.  For instance, we intend to study the random geometry and random motion on the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, which is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity.  In the direction of random CSPs and optimization problems, the proposal features the intriguing phase transitions of the solution spaces predicted by statistical physicists. Since most classical NP-complete problems are expressed as CSPs and random CSPs are a rich source of computationally hard CSPs, the proposed study of random CSPs are expected to shed light on underlying barriers to algorithmic performance. Some of the study of random combinatorial optimization problems is related to understanding the average complexity of certain widely-used algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI proposes to study certain probabilistic models for social network such as random geometric graphs,  as well as the NK-fitness model in biological evolution with the aim of providing mathematical explanation to some experimental findings."

The goal of this research is to reveal the fundamental reactivity rules of common organometallic intermediates in these transformations and to develop new models to interpret ligand effects on reactivity and selectivity. This project's educational and outreach plan aims to maximize the power of computations to enhance learning of organic chemistry concepts and to facilitate synthetic organic chemistry research.

The research investigates novel reaction pathways involving the activated organometallic intermediates formed after the C-H and C-C bond cleavage steps, and elucidates the effects of ligands, directing groups, substituents, ring strain, and norbornene and Lewis acid co-catalysts. To systematically characterize the origin of ligand effects on reactivity and selectivity, a ligand-substrate interaction model is developed. This model uses energy decomposition analysis (EDA) methods to dissect the through-space ligand-substrate interactions into chemically meaningful terms, including steric repulsion, polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion. The insights obtained from the proposed ligand-substrate interaction model are used to develop of a catalyst screening methodology for transition metal catalysts.  In addition, this project establishes a platform for synthetic chemistry researchers to learn and use computational tools to support their scientific research. A spectrum of activities,<br/>including curriculum and training materials development, collaboration and student exchange, and summer research programs that target undergraduate underrepresented minority students, are incorporated in the platform. A discovery-based computational chemistry course for students with synthetic organic backgrounds is developed to provide an interdisciplinary training at the interface of organic and computational chemistry.

The focus of this research is the study of effects that are macroscopically quantum, defying any effective classical description.  Examples thereof include fractionalization, deconfined criticality, and many-body localization. The commonality shared by these effects is that they involve quantum dynamics and/or topology within strongly-interacting systems.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines both analytical and numerical methods, to study quantum phenomena in a variety of theoretical models and experimental settings.  The activities and goals of this proposal include: 1) Exploring the formation of composite excitations (such as pairs, trions, and tetrons) in low-dimensional systems, 2) Developing and testing algorithms that can simulate quantum dynamics, in order to study effects such as thermalization and localization in driven systems, 3) Finding new ways to extract topological invariants, such as Hall conductivity, from the static correlations of a many-body disordered system.<br/><br/>This project will also entail improving public education in quantum mechanics, preparing future engineers and scientists for research in the 21st century and meeting the growing demand for quantum technologists.

Such force-sensitive molecules can be used to make materials that report on their own integrity, that self-heal after damage, or that allow force to be used to control when and where a reaction takes place. Polymers are a useful platform for these types of materials because they can act as ""molecular handles"" for transmitting forces applied to a bulk material down to the molecular scale. However, designing polymers that efficiently and uniformly transmit forces to the molecular scale remains a significant challenge. In this project, the PI and her students will address this challenge by synthesizing and characterizing force-responsive polymers with well-defined connectivity and internal structure at the nanometer scale. This work will enable new understanding of how forces are distributed in polymeric materials and inform design of force-responsive polymeric materials for practical applications. This project will also contribute to education and broadened participation in polymer science through development of active learning classroom activities for use in undergraduate polymer science courses, creation of video demonstrations featuring diverse female role models, and establishment of a women-in-chemistry group to provide mentoring and professional development opportunities for female students in the PI's department.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Designing polymeric platforms that efficiently transduce macroscopic forces to the molecular scale is critical for practical applications of mechanochemistry. In this work, the PI and her students will investigate how the network structure and nanostructure of polymeric materials determine the molecular-scale distribution of forces in polymer networks under strain. Three model systems will be developed to investigate this phenomenon. First, to test the hypothesis that more uniform networks will drive more efficient mechanochemical activation, spiropyran-containing polymers will be crosslinked into well-defined networks, and force-induced activation rates studied as a function of network connectivity, network strand dispersity, and defect content. Second, to investigate the roles of nanostructure and competing structural relaxations in physically crosslinked materials, mechanochemical activation will be studied in triblock copolymers that self-assemble into well-ordered nanoscale morphologies. Finally, new strategies will be developed to enable precise placement of mechanophores within polymer chains, and will then be used to test how chain stretching near nanoscale interfaces can be used to promote or suppress force-driven chemical processes. Together, these research aims will bring fundamental insight to molecular-scale forced distributions in polymer networks and inform design rules for functional mechanochemically-active materials.<br/>These research aims will be integrated with several education and outreach activities aimed at broadening participation and improving education in polymer science. The PI will develop and distribute Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) activities for polymer science. She will also create video demonstrations of important topics in polymer science featuring female presenters as role models for interested students. Finally, she will establish a women-in-chemistry group for students in her department as a mechanism for promoting new mentoring opportunities and broaden female students' participation in the scientific enterprise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, most optical designs have been rotationally symmetric because of manufacturing limitations and production costs. With the development of computer-controlled precision machines, optical devices that are not necessarily symmetric, called free-form or aspherical, can be manufactured. In particular, with the recent advances in additive or three-dimensional manufacturing, free-form lenses can also be made. The design of lenses and mirrors is currently made computationally with ray tracing (i.e., by software calculating the trajectory of the light rays), in which choices are based upon educated guesses. This project is concerned with the development of mathematical methods for the design of lenses, mirrors, and antennas. It provides a better understanding than past approaches of the design problems and enables one to adapt the solutions to the needs required for any specific application. It develops models that are physically more accurate than earlier ones and takes into account, for example, internal reflection.  The project addresses theoretical aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations with concrete problems in optics and photonics.   In addition, the principal investigator is concerned with the mathematical descriptions of the loss of energy due to bending in waveguides, chromatic aberration for lenses, and variations of refractive indices in materials, in particular, negative refraction. A part of the research concerns the development of an algorithm for the numerical calculation of lenses.<br/><br/>The problems are described by partial differential equations involving the output and input intensities and other parameters depending on the models. The goals are concerned with existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions. The methods used derive from the mathematical fields of optimal mass transportation, optimization, and nonlinear partial differential equations of a specific type, called Monge-Ampere-type equations. The techniques include lower and upper estimates of various gradient maps and strict convexity analysis. Partial differential equations appear naturally because the interface surface one looks for has the property that the ratio between the energy sent and received over a small area can be expressed in terms of the input and output energy densities. This yields an equation involving second derivatives of the unknown surface. The development of an algorithm for the numerical calculation of lenses requires establishing Lipschitz estimates for the associated functionals. Furthermore, as waveguides of size comparable to the wavelength of radiation are electromagnetic in nature, the proposal blends with the study of Maxwell's equations in discontinuous and anisotropic media."

While mechanical pumps are conventionally used to drive fluid flow, chemical ""pumps"" can also propel fluid by using chemical reaction networks to create gradients in chemical concentrations and fluid densities. Researchers in the NSF Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) are creating new transformative tools to enable unprecedented control over fluid flow and particle organization in confined environments. These precisely controlled fluid flows enable the design of self-powered, self-sustaining systems that organize particles and are capable of performing complex functions such as an autonomous nanoparticle system that detects a chemical source and collectively delivers a response chemical to it resulting in a vital analysis or creation of a novel structure. The CCMA team includes expertise in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, physical chemistry, fluid flow, and modeling. In addition to providing the chemistry community with new chemical reaction network tools, CCMA is also contributing to science and technology workforce development by training students in multidisciplinary experimental and modeling techniques. Through its industry affiliates program, CCMA is engaging industry in student training and technology transfer. Concurrent with the research, the team is launching a vigorous program of education and outreach to the public. This includes expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities for underrepresented groups in research-based careers. The team is also participating in several large-scale public outreach programs including public lectures, designing hands-on traveling exhibits, and teaming with museums and science centers. <br/><br/>Through collaborative research that combines innovative modeling and experimental studies, the NSF CCI Phase I: Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) is harnessing catalytic chemical reactions to introduce spatiotemporal chemical gradients that drive the flow of a surrounding fluid. This flow, in turn, enables the manipulation of the collective behavior of suspended particles to drive new modes of dynamic self-organization. The Center is developing novel approaches to cause directed transport of nano- and micron-scale materials, control particle organization in confined chambers, and establish new chemical routes for regulating non-equilibrium structure formation from particles in solution. These studies are providing the chemistry community with fundamentally new tools and knowledge, including new chemistries for the creation of catalytic cascades; determination of design rules for chemical feedback loops; demonstration of new modes of out-of-equilibrium assembly; and progress toward new understanding of the nonlinear behavior and auto-amplification emerging from these systems. Potential applications include the creation of standalone microfluidic devices that autonomously perform multi-stage chemical reactions and assays for portable biomedical applications; automated materials assembly in harsh environments; and small-scale factories that can operate autonomously to build microscale components for use in fine instrumentation and robotic systems, and, in parallel, to screen for optimal reaction parameters yielding micro-machines with specified properties. To generate excitement and public appreciation about this emerging area of chemistry, the CCMA team is participating in several large-scale public outreach programs at the participating institutions, including public lectures, hands-on traveling exhibits, and museum and science center projects."

However, the ability to replicate the versatility, stability, and efficiency of biological locomotion in engineered systems has eluded scientists and engineers alike. This project will identify fundamental principles of locomotion, with an emphasis on the role of one of the most fundamental biological attributes, compliance. Compliance is ubiquitous in biological locomotion, appearing in diverse forms of life from the elastic ribbed tail of a fish, to the membrane wings of an insect, to the sinewy muscular body of a snake;  when a human turns a door knob or picks up a spoon -- tasks that are nontrivial for robotic systems --  they can rely on compliance in the hand to passively adjust to small disturbances and uncertainties in the environment.  This project seeks to bridge the gap between classical studies in rigid body mechanics that have long been the purview of the discipline of robotics, and compliant biological strategies for locomotion. The research will rationalize compliant strategies and structures that appear in nature.  This knowledge can in turn be used to design new classes of versatile compliant machines, which may include robust strategies for locomotion and manipulation in robotic systems and new compliant mechanisms for harvesting energy. <br/><br/>This research, which lies at the intersection of controls and the mechanics of continuously deformable systems, will develop two new mathematical approaches to tame the complexity associated with optimization of compliant systems.  The first takes its roots in geometric mechanics, which has already proven effective in the study of locomotion of simple systems. The second inverts the optimization problem by first solving for optimal kinematics (e.g. optimal stroke patterns for swimmers) with a dynamic cost function, and subsequently inverting the optimal kinematics to find the associated dynamic parameters (such as bending stiffness). In addition to the development of these two new mathematical tools, the project will investigate the role of compliance within the context of different biological locomotion modes. Through decades of cumulative research, the scientific community has established a reasonable understanding of the role of compliance in isolated applications, such as legged walking and running, but comparatively little is known in terms of how this concept extends to other modes such as crawling, swimming, and insect flight. This research will address the issue through investigations of the underlying physical principles that motivate the form and physiology of each of these systems.  However, the greatest contribution will come through the amalgamation of these results. By developing new insights across multiple locomotion modes, this project aims to extend the findings into a generalized framework for compliance and locomotion. This framework will then serve as a jumping off point for engineers, who can situate their own systems within a greater map of compliant design methodologies."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award is to support the NSF-funded DarkSide (DS) groups for the construction and operation of DarkSide-20k (DS-20k), a direct WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) with an active (fiducial) mass of 23 tons (20 tons).<br/><br/>The LAr TPC relies heavily on the utilization of argon obtained from underground sources, or UAr. The planned Aria project for UAr purification may improve the worldwide availability of valuable stable rare isotopes such as O-18, N-15, and C-13, used for various medical, industrial and energy generation applications. The production of hundreds of tonnes of low-radioactivity UAr for DS-20k and for other technical uses requiring detection of Ar-37 for nuclear test ban verification, and Ar-39, for radiometric dating. Special E&O programs are planned with focus on educating K-12 teachers about basic physics and how it relates to dark matter detection, re-starting a summer school experience for high-school and undergraduate students, as well giving research opportunities to undergraduate students at participating underrepresented-minority serving institutions.<br/><br/>DS-20k builds on the success of DarkSide-50 (DS-50), operating at LNGS since 2013, which produced two zero-background science results using atmospheric argon (AAr) and then underground argon (UAr) fills. DS-50 demonstrated an 39Ar reduction of 1400 in the UAr. Electron recoil (ER) background was shown to be completely suppressed in the region of interest, with discrimination better than 1 part in 1.5 x 10^7. These results demonstrated the ability of large LAr TPCs to operate in an ""instrumental background-free mode"" - a mode in which less than <0.1 events (other than actual nuclear recoils from elastic scattering of atmospheric and diffuse supernova background neutrinos) are expected in the region of interest for the planned exposure of DS-20k. DS-20k will have ultra-low backgrounds, with the ability to measure its backgrounds in situ, and sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of 1.2 x 10^-47 cm2 (1.1 x 10^-46 cm2) for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2 (10 TeV/c2) mass, to be achieved during a 5 yr run with exposure of 100 t yr.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While a highly useful technique, the Raman scattering cross-section of most molecules is extremely small, and this generally limits its potential uses. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Graphene Enhanced Raman Scattering (GERS), the techniques investigated in this research project, can be used to improve the small signal intensities, thus making Raman spectroscopy-related applications more practical. In terms of broader impacts Dr. Cronin creates workshops for Los Angeles high school chemistry teachers. He leverages existing relationships between USC and its neighboring high schools (e.g., USC's Good Neighbors Campaign, Joint Education Project, and the Service Learning Program) to increase the attendance from disadvantaged schools (i.e., central Los Angeles inner city schools) serving underrepresented minority groups. The content of the workshop is reformulated to expose underrepresented students to the results and, more importantly, the excitement of research. Research projects for undergraduate students introduce them to fundamental scientific research and give them confidence to pursue careers in science and engineering. A new module devoted to SERS is developed for a new course at USC on nanoscience and nanotechnology, and their research accomplishments are discussed in class and integrated into the curriculum.

Specifically, Professor Cronin's group at USC performs Raman spectroscopy of single molecules on various SERS substrates, which enables a direct comparison with the theoretical calculations preformed at the Jensen's group at PSU.  The Raman spectra are collected under various electrochemical conditions in order to explore the role of the molecule-metal energy level alignment and decouple the vibrational-mode-specific chemical enhancement from the uniform chemical enhancement.  Professor Jensen's first principles calculations provide a detailed theoretical framework for interpreting chemical enhancement in SERS and GERS spectra to facilitate a better understanding of the chemical enhancement mechanism.

This impact ranges widely from causing diseases to offering new kinds of antibiotics, to helping crops grow by fixing nitrogen in the soil. Metagenomics is the study of such microbial communities through their extracted DNA. One of the first questions to ask when studying such a community is: ""which organisms are present and at what abundance?""  Most current approaches to this so-called community profiling problem take a parsimonious approach: infer the presence of the fewest organisms possible that still agrees with the observed data. However, treating each organism as completely different from any other can lead to mis-estimates of the different kinds and amounts of organisms present, referred to as biological diversity. This is further complicated by the fact that historically there has been much disagreement about the proper way to analytically measure biological diversity. In this project, the investigators leverage a recently defined, unifying notion of biological diversity to address the problem of correctly profiling a microbial community which has in it organisms of varying similarity. To accomplish this, a new mathematical framework is put forward that utilizes the big data approach of compressive sensing. After advancing the mathematical theory, the investigators will create a software implementation that will allow biomedical researchers to study metagenomic communities while properly accounting for varying organism similarity.  While advancing discovery, this project promotes graduate and undergraduate student teaching and learning. In particular, students are guided to excel at interdisciplinary work in the fields of mathematics and biology. Furthermore, beyond the traditional dissemination routes of conferences and papers, a wide audience is also engaged through a collaboration with SciShow, a popular YouTube channel that will work with the PIs in creating episodes featuring metagenomics suitable for the general public.<br/><br/>Microorganismal community profiling, determining the identity and relative abundance of all microbial organisms present in a given environmental sample through their sequenced DNA, is an important first step in the study of such communities. Many tools and approaches have been proposed to profile microbial communities, and while these tools take advantage of particular properties of microbial genetics to perform the classification task, there is a general lack of rigorous mathematical approaches that allow for definitive statements to be made about such classifications. Furthermore, the estimated biological diversity of a community can vary widely depending on the computational approach used. This is problematic given that biological diversity is a key metric when studying the impact of a bacterial community on its surrounding environment and aberrations of this quantity have been implicated in a number of diseases. This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that there is much disagreement in the scientific community on how to measure biodiversity. Recently, however, it was shown that a single formula subsumes and unifies many of the most popular biodiversity measures. In this project, the PIs utilize this definition of biodiversity to develop a rigorous mathematical approach to simultaneously profile a microbial community and characterize its biological diversity. Mathematically, this reduces to developing (and proving results about) an optimization procedure where the objective function includes biological diversity. Intriguingly, such an approach parallels that of compressive sensing and other such ""big data"" sparsity promoting optimization routines. The main approach will be to reduce this measure of biodiversity to a quasinorm and appropriately modify existing proofs about the convergence and guaranteed reconstruction of such optimization routines. This will result in an optimization framework that allows for simultaneously profiling a microbial community and characterizing its biodiversity directly while considering organism similarity. This will be implemented in user-friendly software and used to analyze gut samples from healthy and sick pre-term infants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Raman spectroscopy and microscopy are popular tools for measuring properties of molecules as they enable research discoveries and chemical characterizations of value to industry, health care, and environmental monitoring. Professor Xu is improving the spatial resolution of stimulated Raman microscopy so that objects with dimensions approaching those of large molecules can be chemically characterized on a routine basis, and in a highly robust and reliable fashion. Specifically, this project examines aerosols in the atmosphere that may contain harmful substances that can impair the health of individuals by causing respiratory illness, heart failure, or even prenatal defects. Understanding the composition, origin, and transformation of aerosols is of vital importance for reducing their production or lessening their affects. In addition to studying aerosols, Dr. Xu's team is also developing an educational module that connects cutting-edge scientific research laboratories with elementary and high school students in a standard classroom setting, via immersive virtual reality experiences. A range of chemical reactions are demonstrated to elementary and high school students through virtual reality streaming, thereby promoting their curiosity for science. Furthermore, Professor Xu's educational activities are improving the effectiveness of scientific outreach for promoting science to the general public.  <br/><br/>Being able to visualize the chemical properties of matter on small length scales is a major challenge for Raman microscopy. The project is addressing this need for super-resolution Raman microscopy by combining scanning probe microscopy and coherent stimulated Raman events. Chemical sensitivity is provided by the stimulated Raman process.  High spatial resolution is achieved by nanoscale probing using a scanning probe microscope tip. The project aims to achieve robust and reliable Raman imaging so as to differentiate objects separated by roughly 10 nanometers. Through integration of nanoscale infrared imaging techniques invented by the Xu group, multimodal spectroscopic and mechanical microscopy are possible for chemical, biological, and environmental samples. Professor Xu's team studies the chemical composition and physical properties of individual sub-micron-sized urban contaminant particles in the atmosphere, allowing his team to decipher their chemical origins and photochemical transformations, with identification of and control over aerosol pollutions being his team's ultimate goal. From efforts associated with the educational plan, many students in elementary and high school classrooms are connected to an advanced research instrument in a laboratory via real-time multimedia capture and streaming devices. The students experience the operation of advanced research instruments, solidifying learning outcomes. Educational activities will be shared with students in schools in the Bethlehem, PA School District.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When combined with cutting-edge results in modern context such as random matrix theory, matrix concentration, and convex geometry, these classical theory will lead to novel principled methods for a general class of problems ranging from high dimensional regression and classification to network data analysis and subspace learning. All methods developed in the proposed research will be implemented as standard R packages freely available and will have high pedagogical value and will be used to develop new courses.

An early instance of this is Euler who noted that for a polygonal surface the number of vertices minus edges plus faces is always two, which allowed him to prove that there are only five platonic solids. In the 1920s, Emmy Noether shifted the focus from numerical invariants to the algebraic structures underlying them, such as sets with algebraic operations. In Homotopy Theory, the focus is extended further to more advanced mathematical notions of infinite-dimensional spaces whose number of connected components recover the underlying numerical invariant. The projects funded by this CAREER award aim to lift classical algebraic invariants of geometric objects to the higher homotopical world and study them from this richer perspective. The educational part of the project consists in expanding access to mathematics not only within the academic world via conferences, but also beyond the usual academic settings to incarcerated individuals: the PI will introduce and teach an inquiry-based learning college level mathematics elective in the B.A. program offered at South Woods Prison. <br/><br/>The primary research goal of the project is to use new results in equivariant stable homotopy theory to study manifolds with group actions and their equivariant diffeomorphisms. Stable homotopy theory, the study of spectra, has played a crucial role in the longstanding program to classify manifolds; however, the classification of G-manifolds for a group G is far less understood than the classical nonequivariant story. Building in part on prior work of the PI on equivariant algebraic K-theory and her collaborative foundational work on equivariant infinite loop space theory, the machinery that turns suitable G-categories into G-spectra, the PI and Malkiewich were have built an equivariant generalization of Waldhausen's algebraic K-theory of spaces. Inspired by Goodwillie?s vision, they conjecture that, for a compact smooth G-manifold M, equivariant A-theory splits off a stable space of equivariant h-cobordisms. This project involves a significant extension of these efforts focused on proving this conjecture and exploiting it to further our understanding of equivariant h-cobordisms and diffeomorphisms of G-manifolds. The second research goal is to apply stable homotopy techniques to study classical invariants by deriving these, i.e., lifting them to spectra. The PI will pursue two projects of this flavor. First, together with Malkiewich and Moi, the PI will study a derived version of the classical character map from representation theory that they have defined. The second, which is a project that the PI is co-leading with Rovi for the Women in Topology Workshop, is to apply and extend recent work of Zakharevich and Campbell on scissors congruence K-theory spectra to manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two key features of an electron are its negative charge and its spin (the electron spins about an axis, like a spinning top). For a long time, scientists have known that an electron's motion through molecules depends on how it's charge is attracted to the positively-charged nuclei and repelled by the other electrons. It was recently discovered that the direction of an electron's spin could alter the ability of an electron to move through a chiral molecule, in a process called spin-filtering. A molecule is chiral when it's mirror images cannot be superimposed on one another; Our right and left hands are examples of chiral objects. The recent finding that the electron's spin can also affect its motion, particularly when interacting with a chiral molecule, opens new possibilities in chemistry.  In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism-A program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Waldeck of the University of Pittsburgh and his students are using electrical and electrochemical methods to correlate the spin filtering properties of chiral molecules with their molecular structures.  Their discoveries could have important implications for controlling chirality in chemical reactions, which could benefit the development of new pharmaceuticals and the creation of better catalysts for advanced manufacturing. Students working on this project benefit from collaborative and multidisciplinary activities with other scientists in Pittsburgh and Israel. Professor Waldeck is also building a network of middle school and high school science teachers to promote interest and learning in science.<br/> <br/>The chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect challenges the conventional wisdom about the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling in organic molecules and raises interesting implications for the role of chirality in electron transfer processes. While numerous experiments demonstrate CISS for a range of molecules, the need exists to perform quantitative measurements of the phenomenon and correlate it with other molecular properties. The experimental studies explore the spin-filtering that arises from CISS.  Hall probe measurements are used to quantify the magnetization that arises from films comprising chiral molecules, both with and without chiral secondary structure.  The researchers also measure spin polarization and compare it with intrinsic molecular properties, such as their chiro-optical response and their polarizabilities. Electrochemical measurements are used to quantify the spin filtering in electrochemical charge transfer reactions through chiral molecules and compared it with Hall probe studies on the same molecules. Given that spin can be an important constraint for chemical transformations and many biomolecules are chiral, the CISS effect could have important implications in both chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research also contributes to this award.  Lipid membranes are a major structural components of all living cells. They separate a cell from its environment and often divide cells into smaller specialized compartments, called ""organelles"". In dividing cells, membranes assume a great variety of intricately shapes. While researchers have excellent theoretical and computational models to describe some shapes, others are less well understood, even though these shapes may have key roles in cellular processes. Professor Deserno and his research group are developing better theories for understanding the shapes of lipid membranes and how this affects the cell function. Furthermore, this project advances learning, by providing many examples<br/>for classroom and homework material in both undergraduate and graduate courses (statistical thermodynamics, biological physics), as well as pedagogically-instructive scripts for theoretical or computational modeling tutorials. The topic offers opportunities for productive undergraduate research projects.  Special efforts are made to attract minority students to science using outreach projects with both middle and high schools in Pittsburgh.

The researchers extend the theoretical framework to encompass the challenging but biologically common situation of membranes that not only consists of a mixture of lipids, but whose composition might differ between the two membrane leaflets (asymmetric membranes).  Finally, the team predicts emergent membrane properties such as edge tensions or fission barriers, or more generally, situations involving highly curved regions that push present elastic membrane theories beyond their limits. As an especially important application, the process of membrane fission is being studied through a combination of theoretical and coarse-grained computational modeling.

This CAREER project examines how diversity can emerge from decision making of individual cells in a multicellular regenerative organism. Freshwater planarians are famous for their regenerative capabilities that are based on a large number of adult pluripotent stem cells (ASCs). These ASCs allow them to reproduce by binary fission, thus creating a clonal population and raising the question of how this species is able to create sufficient diversity to survive on evolutionary time scales. Using tools from statistical physics the PI recently demonstrated that reproduction is largely random, but that reproductive patterns exist whose molecular and physical determinants remain to be investigated. This project aims at testing the hypothesis that population diversity arises from a joint effect of the specifics of planarian reproduction mechanics and epigenetic diversity of ASCs in individual worms. The PI will integrate the research objectives of this proposal into three educational initiatives, which focus on ""learning through research"" and long-term engagement of students: (1) The PI is establishing a partnership with Vista Magnet Middle school that allows 6th graders to work together with her lab on research projects throughout the school year. (2) The PI will continue her efforts toward participation of high school students in research. In particular, she will continue to enable students from Torrey Pines High School to engage in research in her lab throughout the year, which allows them to design and execute their own science projects. (3) The PI will continue her efforts in promoting undergraduate research, in her own group as well as through a new research-centered, quantitative biology laboratory course that she has developed. The course will launch in 2016 and is currently for incoming biology freshmen only. In the context of this proposal, the PI will widen the student population to physics freshmen by adding more physics to the curriculum, and thus create a truly interdisciplinary research-driven laboratory course at the interface of biology and physics in terms of content and student population.<br/><br/>How cellular decision-making causes specific phenotypes in a population has received a lot of attention in the context of single celled organisms, but less is known about how epigenetic inheritance affects population diversity in multicellular organisms. This study will close this knowledge gap using planarians and a unique experimental setup, whereby thousands of individual reproductive events have already been recorded and form the statistical framework for the PI's studies on the population level. The PI's strategy is to (1) test the hypothesis that within individual planarians, ASCs are differentially distributed, in terms of spatial orientation and/or molecular and cellular characteristics (division and death rates, genetic and epigenetic diversity) through quantification of ASC localization, cellular dynamics, and single cell sequencing, (2) investigate the biomechanics of asexual reproduction to understand how resources get distributed among offspring using traction force measurements and time-lapse imaging, and (3) develop a mathematical model based on the cellular and organismal level experimental data to predict population level phenotypic diversity. The model will be tested by comparing its predictions with existing experimental data and the reproductive patterns of specially designed founder individuals in which all cells are known to originate from a single ASC, through RNA-seq and statistical analysis. Together, these approaches will allow the PI to test the hypothesis that spatial epigenetic heterogeneity of stem cells in individuals combined with a stochastic reproduction mechanism determine intraspecies phenotypic differences on the population level, which will be measured in terms of reproductive behaviors. The proposed work will shed new light onto the role of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance for the evolutionary success of asexual multicellular life. On a broader level, stem cell decision-making is currently receiving considerable attention because an understanding of how stem cells switch states stochastically and in response to environmental cues is indispensable for successful stem cell therapies.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences"

This effort will result in the development of smart biomaterials and experimental systems made up of microparticles carrying engineered bacteria. These hybrid, living-nonliving biomaterials will be used as a tool to reprogram mammalian cell signaling. One advantage of an extendable synthetic biomaterials approach that uses engineered bacteria to regulate mammalian calcium signaling could be the abrogation of the need to directly alter mammalian cells to reprogram their behavior. Thus, the need for vectors such as viruses or the creation of transgenic animal models could be reduced. For this effort, bacteria-bound microparticles will be developed that can deliver synthetic genetic components to mammalian cells and reprogram calcium signaling. Calcium signaling is a ubiquitous system that effects cells ranging from nerves to the cells that line the gut, and controls both slow and fast cellular processes. Next, these particles will be made into ?smart? biomaterials as their living component ? the bacteria ? will be engineered with an ability to collaborate and collectively determine when to transmit genetic components to mammalian cells. Finally, mathematical modeling and computational simulation will be used to explore calcium signaling dynamics in mammalian cells in order to determine when alterations will cause the most significant changes in cell signaling dynamics. The smart biomaterials will then be used to reprogram this signaling. In addition, this effort will be integrated with the development of multiple teaching modules for a bioengineering summer camp, and the final curriculum will be widely disseminated to the broader scientific and educational community.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This effort will result in the creation of smart biomaterials that link to engineered intracellular networks necessary for bacteria to cooperatively invade and then reprogram calcium signaling in mammalian cells. First, a synthetic component will be built to enable engineered bacteria to covalently bond to microparticles to create smart biosensing materials that target specific mammalian cell surface markers. Second, different bacterial lines will be programmed with engineered gene circuits that enable them to cooperatively recognize each other and then activate mammalian cell invasion capabilities. This cooperation further ensures that only specific mammalian cells are targeted. Finally, both the synthetic bonding and the cooperative invasion circuitry will be used to reprogram calcium signaling in mammalian cells. Invading bacteria will use RNA interference to alter the dynamics of calcium signaling by knocking down expression of calcium pathway enzymes. Selection of these target enzymes will be informed by modeling of single cell calcium dynamics. This effort will combine recent advances in engineered cellular invasion, mammalian synthetic biology, cell surface display, and engineered quorum sensing to create bacteria-laden, smart biomaterials that reprogram mammalian cells. The proposed effort includes research to advance discovery and understanding in the field of smart biomaterials while also promoting teaching, training, and learning through the development of a new activities targeted toward high school students."

In addition, the PI is actively collaborating on application-oriented projects, and one of the specific goals is to help consolidating theoretical foundations for some statistical learning procedures. Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in probability theory.<br/><br/>The PI will study limiting behavior for stochastic models with emphasis on geometric, optimizational and spectral aspects as well as interactions among them. The stochastic processes under consideration cover a wide range of spectrum and are of fundamental importance in respective research communities. For instance, random geometry of Gaussian free field has been a phenomenal research topic in two-dimensional probability, and the closely related Liouville quantum gravity surfaces can be thought of as the canonical models of random two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds; random constraint satisfaction problems have strong connections with spin glass theory and complexity theory, and it is of major interest to understand the connections between the phase transitions of the solution spaces and the algorithmic transitions; random field model has been a classic example in understanding how presence of disorder affects the behavior of statistical physics models; Anderson localization for random Schroedinger operators is motivated by understanding the conductor-insulator transition. In order to make progress on these problems, the PI will attempt to bring in new insights from physics, develop new mathematical tools and identify new connections among different mathematical branches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus is on reactions that take place on a hard surface, such as a metal, which acts as a catalyst. Catalysts are used in the production of household products and almost all industrial chemicals as they help speed up the chemical synthesis. Almost 25% of the global industrial-sector energy consumption is due to the catalytic production of basic chemicals and fuels alone! A sound microscopic understanding of the processes of chemical reactions at the smallest scale, obtained by computational analysis, could help substantially in developing new catalysts or improving existing ones. However, a key challenge is that the present computational methods applicable to surface reactions are not accurate enough to reliably identify which of the many competing reaction pathways are actually taking place in reality. This research addresses this challenge by enabling the use of high-accuracy computational methods from small-molecule theoretical chemistry, for use in the complex environments of realistic catalysis at surfaces. The research activities are integrated with an educational approach aimed at senior undergraduate and incoming graduate students.  The goal of the educational activities is to help these students become proficient users of computational techniques.  The broader technical impacts of the research may result in improvement in industrial processes (e.g., reducing waste, increasing energy efficiency, reducing dependence on imported precious metals, etc.), and thereby contribute to the economy of independence of the US. The educational materials will be made available to everyone, and may provide disadvantaged but bright students with poor access to educational resources with a starting point for learning powerful computing techniques.  <br/><br/><br/>Concretely, the research targets the development of wave-function based electronic structure methods which have sufficient accuracy (~1 kcal/mol in relative energies) to allow for definitive thermochemical calculations on the surfaces of hard materials, such as current industrial heterogeneous catalysts. First, a suitable quantum embedding framework, based on the Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) is developed. The method is specialized for embedding a single target fragment.  This allows the polarization functions needed by thermochemical wave function methods and facilitates to be introduced using fast Kohn-Sham DFT for the mean-field description of the environment. Second, high-accuracy local coupled cluster methods will be developed which are capable of being used in the presence of the embedding. Third, the techniques from the first two steps will be adjusted to incorporate a coupling to an actual periodic surface system via imposing fixed boundary condition from ideal bulk/surface systems (as opposed to imposing periodic boundary conditions on the target system itself).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It supports theoretical research and education to advance and elucidate the theory of knotted fields.  Though it has been well known for more than three decades that topological defects can act on each other through commutation, it is only in recent times that we can: a) knot defects by design; b) tie and manipulate knotted disclinations; and c) study biaxial nematics, a physical system with a non-Abelian fundamental group.  The stream of experimental results that has already started will be ample fodder for studying the topological dynamics of these knots. What makes this most exciting is that these are now questions that can be probed directly through experiment.<br/>A second thrust of the research is the topological characterization and classification of defects in translationally ordered media. The PI will focus specially on smectic liquid crystals because translational order is only broken in one direction and thus there is only one associated Nambu-Goldstone mode.   In addition to dislocations and disclinations, smectics enjoy a different class of geometrically precise configurations, focal conic domains.  The interaction between focal conic domains and topological defects is largely underexplored.  Finally, and most importantly, because smectics are so soft, dislocations, disclinations and focal conic domains are easy to observe and manipulate in experiment.   Building on the work of the PI and his group over the past three years, the PI will formulate a theoretical description to combine the three types of building blocks in the case of three-dimensional smectics.  <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's efforts to convey the science of liquid crystals effectively to K-12 and college students, high school teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical research and education to advance the theory of soft matter. The PI has a track record of learning and applying modern mathematics and incorporating it into his research.  In turn, these insights have been applied directly to experiments that employ traditional microscopy, polarizing filters, and hot plates.  The focus of this research project is on liquid crystals, materials that pervade our modern life, from our phones and watches to our computers and cars. The optical properties that make them the backbone of a $100 billion/year industry arise from a beautiful interplay between chemistry, theoretical physics, geometry, and topology.  The PI will study the generalization of the fluid vortices that shed off the tip of a canoe paddle or an airplane wing.  To do this, the PI will integrate the fields of materials physics, statistical mechanics, topology, and geometry, challenging traditional disciplinary lines with the hope of substantial technological and intellectual progress.   Visually compelling, the field of liquid crystals has and will allow the PI to reach out effectively to K-12 and college students, high school teachers, and the general public."

Although patients are most willing and able to take their medications by mouth, this is not currently possible for protein therapeutics like insulin. The most significant challenge preventing oral protein delivery is that the protein drugs are too large to exit the small intestine and enter the bloodstream where they take effect. This research will overcome that challenge by creating chemically modified proteins that temporarily make the intestines more porous so that the protein drug can be absorbed. The chemical modification will consist of polymer chains extending from the surface of the protein. We will learn how the chemistry of the polymer improves the transport of the medicine into the bloodstream and optimize the chemistry for the maximum therapeutic effect.

Oral protein delivery is one of the most pressing unmet needs in medicine today, and its realization would have dramatic effects on patient compliance and the accessibility of protein therapeutics. Unfortunately, oral protein delivery has not yet been realized due to several challenges, the most significant of which is the inability of therapeutic proteins to cross the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream. This work will enable oral protein delivery through the engineering of protein-polymer conjugates that selectively enhance intestinal protein permeability. Polymers containing permeation-enhancing side chains will be grown from the surface of the therapeutically relevant enzyme, asparaginase. The side chains will contain piperazine derivatives, a class of molecules previously shown by the PI to offer excellent permeation enhancement without cytotoxicity. The proposed research will determine structure-function relationships to aid in rational design and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of permeation enhancement. At the end of the NSF grant period, this first-of-its-kind platform technology will be well-poised for application to additional therapeutic proteins, including enzymes and antibodies. Results will be published for public dissemination. The proposed outreach plan will benefit students of all age levels, including over 1500 K-12 Pittsburgh students each year who will learn from hands-on drug delivery modules. Undergraduate and graduate students will be groomed as productive, influential future engineers through technical training in biological transport and drug delivery mechanisms, with an emphasis on research opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New methods to convert natural gas directly to higher value fuels and chemicals would limit the current practice of flaring (direct burning to carbon dioxide without energy capture).  Currently, more than 140,500 million cubic meters of natural gas is wasted each year in the flaring process.  This research project seeks to convert hydrocarbons such as natural gas, to higher value commodity chemicals by developing new catalysts that speed-up the desired chemical transformation efficiently and effectively. Cost, availability, and its benign nature, make oxygen/air the best choice of oxidant for large-scale chemical oxidation. Professor Goldberg is committed to mentoring and encouraging a diverse group of students to pursue careers in science. Her students learn to develop and analyze chemical reactions and scientific arguments, critically evaluate their data, use advanced laboratory techniques and modern analytical and spectroscopic methods, search and manage the expansive scientific literature, and communicate effectively with other scientists and lay audiences. Through participation in science outreach events and programming at the University of Pennsylvania and in the Philadelphia Public Schools, the research team educates the general public about the important role that catalysis plays in their lives. High school students in the greater Philadelphia area learn that scientists come from all backgrounds, and that this diversity is crucial in the sciences as it spurs innovation and accelerates the finding of new knowledge and solutions. <br/><br/> <br/>This project targets the development of robust catalysts that can selectively activate and functionalize carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds using air or oxygen as the oxidant. New technologies are needed to enable the economically viable and responsible use of the large amounts of natural gas that are currently being accessed due to the recent innovations in hydrolytic fracturing and directional drilling methods. To this end, the research team on this project is investigating new mechanisms for the activation of alkane C-H bonds. Detailed studies of the reactions of organometallic alkyl compounds (the metal products of C-H activation) with oxygen are carried out to gain the mechanistic understanding that is needed for the design and development of methods to use oxygen as the oxidant in selective partial oxidations of natural gas. In parallel with the laboratory research, the project trains a workforce of scientists who is needed to address the many future technological challenges. This project is providing the next generation of scientists with important training and skills to allow them to be creative and effective in solving global challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low molecular weight peptides attracted increasing interest as gel forming compounds due to their low synthesis costs and the ease by which their reactive sites can be modified. Peptides are known to self-assemble into supramolecular structures, such as ribbons, nanotubes, and monolayers, which are predominantly composed of sheet-like structures.   Several diseases are linked to the self-assembly of peptides/proteins including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.  Overall very little is understood regarding the self-assembly of peptides/proteins into fibrils. With respect to biotechnology, the self-assembly process has very positive aspects. It allows the generation of biocompatible material with incorporated biological function. Their biomedical and biotechnological relevance for developing suitable protocols for drug delivery, microfluidics, and tissue engineering/repair, is well established.  This project will focus on elucidating specific interactions between peptides that lead to self-assembly and bulk gelation. Phase diagrams will be constructed to identify material constraints and identify potential applications for series of peptides.  The results are expected to bring significant insight into designing new peptides with tailored or controlled aggregation kinetics and gelation properties for a broad range of applications.  The project outcomes will have significant impact in understanding and interpreting the role of peptides and their sequence in disease manifestation.  Lastly, the project will result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Physics. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>This research project is motivated by the discovery of the unexpected gelation of cationic glycylalanylglycine (GAG) in ethanol/water and glycylhistidylglycine (GHG) in water at neutral pH. The planned experiments and computations are aimed at a thorough assessment of the molecular mechanisms and microscopic and macroscopic properties of gels formed by the above unblocked GxG peptides. We will focus initially on five tripeptides: GAG, GHG, GVG, GDG and GFG and their respective blocked derivatives. Experimental investigations will determine the effect of environment (solvent composition, pH, temperature, peptide concentration) on peptide conformation and interaction energies. Rheology will be used to determine the strength, compliance, and recovery of volume spanning networks. Circular dichroism (CD), IR, vibrational spectroscopy, and rheology will be used to construct phase diagrams with regard to temperature, peptide concentration, pH and the mole fraction of co-solvents. The phase diagrams will also be analyzed in the context of current theories of gelation to determine interaction energies. Finally, investigations will focus on exploring the different steps of the tripeptide gelation process: from the onset of tripeptide aggregation to the formation of large scale fibrils.  Some key questions that will be answered are how the peptides are integrated into a sample spanning network and what type of structure and conformation do the peptides make inside fibrils. A strong emphasis will be placed on characterizing the kinetics of gelation and the dependence of kinetic rates on external stimuli. Furthermore, we will determine the local conformation of peptides in the crystalline fibrils by combining vibrational spectroscopy data with molecular dynamics and density functional calculations. The unique comparison and analysis of simultaneous rheological, computational and spectroscopic data will unfold the complexities of peptide aggregation, fibrillization, and ultimately network formation from the molecular to macroscopic scale. The proposed research is clearly at the interface between physics, chemistry and biology. The project would provide funding for graduate students and one undergraduate student. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained on a variety of instruments and learn how to combine rather different data sets into a common picture describing the investigated systems. Undergraduate research will be become part of the student's Co-op experience."

In a crystalline structure, atoms are arranged according to predefined rules while in amorphous structures atoms are packed in random fashion. Quasicrystalline structure can be considered as a state between the two. Materials of crystalline and amorphous structures, represented by gold and window glass, respectively, have been known to mankind for thousands of years. In contrast, materials of quasicrystalline structure were recently discovered in 1980's, and many aspects remain to be studied. An aluminum-copper-iron alloy of Al65Cu20Fe15 composition is one of the most studied alloys related to quasicrystalline phase. This alloy, when it is prepared by arc melting, is porous, consisting of multiple voids with particles of different morphologies on the surface. Despite previous extensive studies, there are many different opinions about the make-up and formation processes of these particles, probably because no previous studies have placed focus on them. Further, a primary study of these particles by the present principal investigator has revealed new details that deserve further investigation. This project will carry out a detailed study on these particles. In addition to scientific contribution, the project has significant impact on the education at Clarion University, a rural teaching college. First, it enables the principal investigator to stay active in research field and to integrate latest developments into teaching. Second, it gives students a rare opportunity to experience or observe authentic scientific research, strengthening their confidence in pursuing careers in science and technology. Annually, the project will reach students in the following ways: eight undergraduate students will work on the project either as paid research assistants or as volunteers; two local high school students will be given opportunity to work on the project for a week in summer; approximately 100 undergraduate students will be exposed to the project through introduction in course teaching; and interested students from one neighboring high school will be invited to campus to learn about the project from principal investigator and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>    <br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>Six important problems related to the morphology and crystal orientation of particles on the surface of the voids of as-prepared Al65Cu20Fe15 alloy have been identified, which have either not been reported previously or have not been well understood. For example, there is strong evidence indicating that one type of particle consists of multiple phases, in contrast to previous single phase assumption. There are experimental results that lead to a speculation about the orientation relationship between quasicrystalline thin film and crystalline substrate, which needs to be confirmed and investigated further. These problems will be clarified experimentally by using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), to be carried out at the principal investigator's home institute. The studies will be supplemented by theoretical analysis and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) examinations to be performed in collaboration with other institutes. Because of the clear and unique focus, this project will generate sufficient data to fill in the missing details and to clarify conflicting reports about the microstructure of this well-known alloy, thus establishing a reliable and consistent model about the phase formation process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many properties of positronium, such as energy levels and lifetimes, are accessible to high-precision experiments.  Positronium properties can also be calculated theoretically to high precision using the methods of bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) because strong and weak interaction effects are negligible in this system.  Consequently, positronium is an ideal system for testing the limits of electromagnetic bound state physics.  The activities involved in calculating the positronium energy levels will be of great educational value to the undergraduate students involved as collaborators in this work.  The students will learn theoretical methods and techniques of calculation more advanced than those usually encountered at the undergraduate level.  They will gain valuable experience by doing the research, by presenting their results at professional meetings, and by publishing their work as co-authors in research journals.<br/><br/>Positronium energy levels of low-lying states (n=1 and n=2) have been measured with uncertainties of roughly one MHz, and experiments are presently being developed to significantly reduce some of these uncertainties.

The ground state hyperfine splitting is of interest because the most precise experimental results are not in accord with current theory.  These transition energies and more will be calculated to a new level of precision.  The calculations will be based on the low-energy effective quantum field theory NRQED (Non-Relativistic QED), which provides a natural and efficient framework for the study of non-relativistic atoms."

Often, minor compositional modifications that occur locally in a material can lead to drastic changes in properties such as corrosion resistance, catalytic function, fracture strength, and interfacial adhesion. This project seeks to uncover the dependence of surface segregation on controllable parameters such as bulk composition, surface orientation and morphology, and external stimuli as well as the microscopic mechanism of the surface segregation process. The fundamental insight will have considerable practical importance for a wide range of material systems, properties, and reactions because segregation not only modifies surface chemistry and composition but also the atomic structure and strain state in the surface and subsurface regions in multicomponent materials. The fundamental knowledge of the prototypes of basic processes controlling surface composition and structure evolution will open up new perspectives of designing alloys with desired surface properties by manipulating bulk properties of the alloy and their interplay with the surroundings. As part of this research program, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will learn about new microscopy, spectroscopy and computational techniques as well as work on materials issues that are at the forefront of current materials research. The training of students in the broader area of materials science will result in future leaders that are better equipped to solve the complex energy and environmental problems that face society. Results from this project will also be incorporated into undergraduate- and graduate-level courses and high school outreach programs to advance nanomaterials-related education.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: <br/>Although phase diagrams delineating the thermodynamic conditions for phase/structure selection in bulk alloys are well established, the composition and structure of an alloy surface can be significantly different from those of the bulk due to the surface segregation of the alloying element. A microscopic understanding of many physical and chemical processes taking place at the surface of multicomponent materials requires as a prerequisite atomic-scale understanding of surface segregation induced compositional and structural evolution. Despite this importance, the atomic processes governing the onset, promotion, and termination of surface segregation under practical conditions are largely unknown. This project employs atomistically informed approaches toward a mechanistic understanding of surface segregation phenomena by gaining transformational knowledge of surface compositional and structural dynamics of alloys. The research is based on a combined atomistic experimental and computational program with tightly integrated feedback loops, including quantitative in-situ metrology that uses complementary forefront techniques for dynamically measuring surface composition, structure and chemistry of the alloys under realistic environment conditions and closely coordinated atomistic modeling ranging from first-principles calculations to large-scale molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The comprehensive understanding will shed light on many multicomponent systems due to a shared set of prototypical basic processes governing surface segregation, including thermodynamic driving forces, interplay between chemical ordering and elemental segregation, and kinetic obstacles of atomic exchanges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deep connections between the integers and a broad range of mathematical areas from geometry to number theory have direct analogues for lattices in Lie groups, and the way in which lattices in Lie groups sit at the interface of so many fields has made them of fundamental importance since the late 19th century. The primary motivation for this project is to deepen our understanding of these connections. There is a special class of lattices that are called ""arithmetic"", where the connections to number theory are particularly strong, and this an overarching goal of this project is to use techniques from dynamics and geometry to understand when a lattice is arithmetic, and moreover deepen our understanding of the geometric consequences of arithmeticity. The project provides summer support for graduate students allowing them time for research and collaboration.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project aims to understand the geometry and topology of locally symmetric spaces, particularly real and complex hyperbolic manifolds, inspired by the fundamental problems in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory that have dominated the fields since the pivotal work of Thurston and Gromov.

More importantly, the questions studied in dimensions 2 and 3 for the last forty years are closely related to classical problems about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and real and complex hyperbolic lattices are precisely the cases where many of the basic questions remain open, e.g., Betti numbers and problems related to (non)arithmeticity.

This first quantum revolution enabled the amazing technological developments of the 20th century, resulting e.g. in modern electronics and immense societal impact. Today the world is witnessing the early days of the second quantum revolution, where the convergent elements of quantum mechanics like quantum superposition or quantum entanglement will lead to widespread practical applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography or quantum sensing. One of the major obstacles in achieving this goal is lack of specialized workforce. The required qualifications comprise deep understanding of quantum mechanics, but also include practical knowledge of the convergent fields of microwave electronics, cryogenic and ultra-high vacuum technologies, quantum materials, advanced computer programming and algorithm optimization, with elements of device and system engineering. Existing educational programs usually specialize in only one or two of the above areas. This project helps fill the void in educating the future cadre for quantum revolution by putting together a transdisciplinary group of practitioners experienced in various aspects of quantum science with a group of select graduate students from across the US in the form of an annually recurring Summer School. The cultural and intellectual challenge comes from a need to equip students with practical knowledge of multiple fields relevant to quantum revolution, but also from the desire to foster their ability to learn and maintain the curiosity needed for future progress. The interactions of students with leaders in the field are based on a mixture of direct presentations, tutorials and talks, with interactive activities including round table discussions, student presentations, and courses in practical use of quantum technology. Interactions between speakers from various disciplines, from condensed matter physics through quantum chemistry and engineering, are expected to generate new ideas at the boundaries of fields.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>As the first quantum revolution of the 1920s led to the modern digital and telecommunications age of the present day, the current position of quantum science suggests that a second quantum revolution is at hand which is expected to have wide reaching implications not only for our fundamental understanding of the natural world but also for computing, energy, and global connectivity.  A critical component of this development is the education of the next generation of scientists in the principles, methods, and goals of this ""Quantum Leap"".  This is motivated by the observation that the rapidly growing quantum industry is facing an acute shortage of uniquely qualified workforce. New approaches to education in quantum science are particularly important given the breadth of disciplines brought together in this area- reaching across mathematics, chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering.  As part of initiating this educational effort, this project puts forth a summer school for graduate students as a direct tool to provide an in-depth immersion in the emerging field of convergent quantum science and technology.  The approach of this gathering is a summer school wherein students are exposed to education in science and technology beyond what they could be exposed to in traditional classroom settings or typical conferences/workshops.  Lecturers focus on pedagogical lectures on these topics rather than seminar style research presentations.  Afternoon sessions are aimed at interactive activities involving students and presenters.  Themed panels with speakers and organizers serving as panel members for both scientific and career related sessions are planned. The lecturers are encouraged to participate in several days rather than one or two days, to include the additional benefit of cross-disciplinary ""pollination"" of ideas between lecturers from different disciplines. The program combines aspects of classroom style education, research seminars, multitude of interactive forms and an active discussion forum.  The two week duration for the school encourages both formal and informal discussion between students and lecturers as well as among the students themselves."

The atomic momentum distributions in these 1D gases will be precisely measured under a variety of conditions, and this will serve as a benchmark test for advanced theoretical approaches that are being developed to understand many-body quantum systems.  This project is also designed to observe quantum many-body phenomena such as ""dynamical fermionization"" and ""prethermalization.""  These experiments will motivate new theoretical approaches that will also be relevant for nuclear and condensed matter physics, and will lead to a deeper understanding of quantum many-body phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and quantum information processing.  Students working on this project will learn advanced atomic physics research techniques that will prepare them for careers in academia or high tech industry.<br/><br/>This team will work on three sets of measurements related to the momentum distributions of 1D Bose gases, using a technique that is dramatically more precise than previous approaches. The first set of measurements will be of equilibrium momentum distributions with intermediately and strongly coupled gases, for a range of temperatures. These will be compared to new theoretical calculations. Any disagreement would indicate that the 1D gases do not have a thermal distribution, despite their extremely gentle preparation starting from equilibrated 3D gases. The second set of measurements will entail the first observation of dynamical fermionization, where the initially bosonic momentum distribution of a Tonks-Girardeau gas transforms into that of a non-interacting Fermi gas, thus directly revealing the underlying conserved quantities in this system. The third set of measurements will measure the early stages of prethermalization after a quantum quench. The quench will be a Bragg scattering pulse, and the part of the ensuing evolution that is related to the point contact interactions is much faster than typical evolution in a trap. Comparisons with recently developed theory will be made. For the latter two sets of the measurements it is beyond existing theoretical methods to perform these dynamical calculations in the intermediate coupling regime. But the investigators propose to perform the experiments there as well, thus setting benchmarks for theorists to work toward."

Whereas liquids in common use today consist of neutral molecules, ionic liquids are comprised of only charged species, ions like Na+ and Cl-, the constituents of common table salt. Although the strong attraction between such small ions renders NaCl, solid except at very high temperatures, by increasing the sizes of the component ions and doing other things to inhibit solidification, one can create purely ionic materials that remain liquid at room temperature. Insufficient understanding of how to predict the basic aspects of ionic liquids important in these applications, such as how quickly a solute molecule moves through a given ionic liquid, hampers their applications. Professor Maroncelli and his group use a combination of experimental and theoretical tools to address this challenge by studying how the structure and dynamics of ionic liquids determine the friction experienced in molecular movements. <br/><br/>The Penn State research team is using computer simulations, supplemented by some NMR experiments, to construct a predictive understanding of molecular transport and re-orientional dynamics in ionic liquids, in particular how these dynamics depend upon the structure of a given liquid and the chemical makeup of its ions. The first project entails molecular dynamics simulations coupled to statistical analysis of experimental data on solute diffusion in order to develop models that can be used to predict the behavior new solute - ionic liquid combinations of potential technological interest. The second project uses a combination of simulation and theory to interpret apparently anomalous results obtained when the technique positron annihilation spectroscopy (PALS) was recently applied to ionic liquids. PALS is a well-known method for measuring voids in polymeric materials, but its recent use in ionic liquids provided seemingly unrealistic results. Because void structure is central to theories of molecular transport, this project seeks to learn how to correctly interpret PALS data in ionic liquids. The final project involves simulations and NMR experiments of solute rotations in order to explore how voids change over time and how these void dynamics may influence chemical reactions."

Electrochemical reactions use electrical currents in place of traditional chemicals.  Chemical reagents often produce undesired by-products because they produce too much or too little energy to make (or break) specific chemical bonds; Because electrical currents can be precisely controlled at a given potential (voltage), electrochemical reactions can be tuned to provide just the right amount of energy needed for a desired transformation.  In this way, electrochemical reactions promise to reduce chemical waste when compared to traditional chemical reactions.  This research produces new environmentally benign synthetic methods using electrochemical techniques. The research team works with collaborators to combine organic reaction development with theory and electrochemical techniques.  The new method development illustrate the power of employing oxidation reactions in increasing molecular complexity. The research team has a strong commitment to pursuing green chemistry and lessons learned through this research are used as examples in undergraduate classes directed toward environmentally benign organic synthesis.   <br/><br/>This project uses electrochemical oxidations to advance the oxidative carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage processes that have been developed in the Floreancig group.  The study replaces quinone oxidants, which were originally used as stoichiometric reagents, with oxoammonium ions. The oxoammonium ions are more readily regenerated through anodic oxidation than their quinone counterparts and offer additional advantages, such as easier reactivity tuning and the potential for developing asymmetric variants for enantioselective synthesis. The first objective is to optimize the electrochemical regeneration of oxoammonium ions in oxidative cyclization reactions to allow for low catalyst loading by exploring the impact of oxidant strength, electrode material, and substrate oxidation potential. The second objective is to gain insight into the mechanistic nuances of oxidative carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage by oxoammonium ions through a combined experimental and theoretical approach that provides information on the importance of charge transfer and geometry of the transition states. The third objective is to develop new transformations that are possible with oxoammonium ions but not quinones, including cycloaddition reactions and kinetic resolutions. By disseminating the results through publication and seminars, the Floreancig group provides the scientific community with powerful new transformations, valuable mechanistic insights, and blueprints for interfacing electrochemistry with oxidative functionalization reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most fruitful developments in this field has been the study of the algorithmic content of mathematics. At the same time, concerns about the foundations of mathematics have led to the analysis of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning, and the study of the relative power of such systems. The computability-theoretic approach has turned out to play a key role in this project. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics whose methods and results underlie a great deal of mathematical reasoning, so the study of its algorithmic content and of the systems required to formalize its methods is particularly important. Computable combinatorics has a long history, but has seen a recent surge of interest highlighting the fact that computability-theoretically natural notions tend to be combinatorially natural, and vice-versa. This project aims to strengthen the connections between computability theory and combinatorics by increasing our understanding of the algorithmic content of combinatorial principles, through a concerted group effort to use what we have learned in recent years to systematize the area further, work toward solving a number of its outstanding questions, and explore its outward-facing aspects.<br/><br/>This project will address major open problems such as determining whether Hindman's Theorem holds arithmetically, and whether it is equivalent to its restriction to sums of length at most two; determining the first-order part of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs, and clarifying the computability-theoretic relationship between this principle and its stable version; and determining the exact proof-theoretic strength of Laver's Theorem. More importantly, it will focus on the development of lines of research particularly relevant to the growing interest in connections between computability theory and combinatorics, including the study of questions of methodological interest to combinatorialists, for instance ones involving Hindman's Theorem and the use of ultrafilters in combinatorics; the development of new proofs of combinatorial theorems inspired by questions regarding the computational content of these theorems, along the lines of Montalban's new proof of Laver's Theorem; the analysis and comparison of different general methods, such as the use of ultrafilters, topological dynamics, and probabilistic methods; the development of notions of comparison between theorems that, while still computability-theoretic in spirit, are closer to being direct reflections of combinatorial differences; the understanding of splittings of combinatorial principles into computationally and combinatorially simpler parts; the study of the usefulness of combinatorially-defined objects as computational oracles; and the study of the first-order consequences of the existence of combinatorially-defined second-order objects. This project is thus aimed at developing the study of the connections between computability theory and combinatorics along a large number of related directions, making use of the computability-theoretic, proof-theoretic, and combinatorial expertise of its PIs, senior personnel, and key collaborators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These proteins, in turn, have key functions in cells. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Christine Phillips-Piro from Franklin and Marshall College to use non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), i.e., amino acids that do not occur in living systems, to investigate the structure and to systematically modify the function of proteins. The addition of new ncAAs results in unusual proteins that have very different functions than those made with the natural amino acids.  The research project provides interdisciplinary training for undergraduate researchers in chemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, and protein structure determination. Dr. Phillips-Piro's courses enable undergraduate students to learns about current scientific research. She integrates scientific literacy in two different courses - general chemistry and a general education course. Her team also helps to organize and run a regional chemistry conference for undergraduates (the Intercollegiate Student Chemists? Convention (ISCC)). Professor Phillips-Piro is a member of the Advanced Photon Source User Organization (APSUO) which seeks to broaden participation at Argonne National Laboratory. <br/><br/>The research supported by this award exploits a targeted collection of ncAAs being used to both study protein structure and tune protein function. Local environments in a thermostable heme nitric oxide and/or oxygen binding protein (H-NOX) are assessed by using the ncAA vibrational reporter 4-cyano-L-phenylalanine in concert with temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The systematic modulation of the the oxygen binding affinity of the heme protein is achieved by using tyrosine ncAAs with altered phenolic hydrogen acidity.  These moieties influence the strength of hydrogen bonding between a key amino acid residue (Y140) distal to the heme and the small molecule bound to the heme. Metal-binding ncAAs are used to generate a novel bimetallic enzyme based on the H-NOX scaffold. The insights gained and tools developed by Dr. Phillips-Piro may benefit other scientists who employ ncAAs to probe, modify, and/or engineer biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team of researchers in the Center for Nanothread Chemistry aims to produce whole new families of nanothreads with diverse chemical compositions, structures, and properties. These materials can currently be made only in very small amounts, and a key goal of the Center is to learn how make larger quantities that will enable further fundamental science and technology impacts.

Nanothreads, the first such example, are highly extended one-dimensional molecules with cage-like bonding, akin to the thinnest possible threads of diamond and capped by circumferential hydrogen. Nanothreads are synthesized by an innovative mechanochemical technique in which molecules with multiple unsaturated functions react under stress applied at carefully controlled rates. This strategy overcomes the traditional requirement for topochemical commensuration between the reactant and product and thus allows for many more molecular crystals to react into well-defined structures. The Center team is developing an actionable understanding of the reaction mechanism and enabling the design of new threads with desired arrangements of both interior heteroatoms and exterior functional groups. Post-synthesis modification allows for versatile incorporation of new groups of diverse function and also allows for additional structural elaboration. The unique architecture and properties of nanothreads provide opportunities for commercialization.

The Mid-Atlantic has a growing and diverse community of number theorists. The need for a regular meeting like MASON is especially acute among students (both graduate and advanced undergraduates) and researchers at the many comprehensive and primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. MASON conferences will bring members of these groups in contact with one another and with distinguished number theorists. Thus, the meetings will be an important venue for professional development and networking for Ph.D. candidates, junior mathematicians and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions. Moreover, MASON meetings will provide opportunities for the recruitment of students into graduate programs and for contacts between academic and non-academic mathematicians with interests in number theory. The award will be used primarily to support the traveling expenses of students, postdocs, and faculty without institutional travel support to the next three MASON conferences: MASON II in April of 2018 at Towson University; MASON III in the spring of 2019 at James Madison University; and MASON IV in 2020 at Gettysburg College. <br/><br/>MASON meetings will feature plenary lectures by leading experts in number theory and parallel sessions of contributed talks by participants. Each MASON meeting will feature also a problem session. The scientific focus of the conference will be on the following areas within number theory: algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, automorphic forms and L-functions, elementary and combinatorial number theory, modular forms, and the theory of partitions. The plenary lectures will introduce the audience to recent breakthroughs in these areas, which represent--in broad strokes--the spectrum of interests of researchers in the region. In the contributed talks, participants will have the opportunity to report on their own research and to learn from each other. MASON meetings will also be venues to forge future research collaborations, both among number theorists and between number theorists and research mathematicians in related mathematical fields. <br/><br/>More information about MASON can be found at the main MASON website: <br/>https://wp.towson.edu/akumchev/mason/."

Active materials represented by suspensions of synthetic self-propelled particles harvest energy from their environment and alter the properties of the surrounding fluid.  They have novel materials properties and promising applications.  Here, a new concept of ink for 3D printing, termed ""active ink"", is introduced.  Even a small fraction of active self-propelled particles in a fluid results in a dramatic reduction of viscosity, enhancing ink transport through the nozzle and increasing printing speed.  This project will facilitate the design and manufacture of new materials, significantly shortening the path from prototype to product.  This research will also enable a highly multidisciplinary training and education of students and postdocs who will learn theoretical techniques in applied mathematics and computations, as well as experimental techniques employed in chemistry and nanofabrication.  Apart from the development of new 3D printing technology, the work will lead to novel mathematical models and efficient computational algorithms.<br/><br/>A drastic reduction of effective viscosity and increase of self-diffusivity of the active ink due to the presence of synthetic self-propelled particles will be studied.  The reduction of the effective viscosity will enhance ink transport through the nozzle.  The increase of the effective self-diffusivity will enable faster polymerization resulting in resolution enhancement and more accurate 3D feature design.  In addition, due to their fundamentally different response to applied shear flow, the use of active particles may lead to the design of composite materials with novel distributions of particles.  The functionalization of active particles also will allow tuning the properties of the hardened polymer.  New mathematical models will be developed and analyzed both numerically and analytically.  Their predictions will be experimentally verified.  The continuum partial differential equation model based on kinetic theory will be analyzed asymptotically and numerically.  A key challenge here is to find stationary flow solutions by employing methods from fixed-point and topological degree theory.  In simulations of particle-based models, the challenge is to accurately capture the dynamics of the reaction that occurs as the active rods move.  A difficulty in simulations of the continuum model is incorporating the molecular-scale reactions into a mesoscale approach.  By addressing these challenges, the utility and applicability of these computational methods will be significantly expanded, allowing them to be used for simulating a broad range of multi-component, dynamical systems."

Protons are collections of quarks bound by the strong nuclear force much as atoms are collections of electrons bound to the nucleus by the electric force. By studying the proton collisions at high energy we learn how these quarks are bound inside the proton. The proton also has an intrinsic property called spin, which can be visualized by thinking of the proton as a sphere spinning on its axis, much like the Earth rotates on its axis. In particular, when high energy beams of spin-aligned protons collide at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) the resulting particles can reveal how much of the proton's spin is carried by its gluons or by different types of quarks. The goal of this project is search for the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton, which is identified as an important question by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee. These collisions are observed as photons and electrons in the STAR detector and its component part, called the FMS, which will be maintained as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award will fund the Penn State group to prepare, calibrate and operate the FMS for upcoming RHIC runs and to analyze data recently collected.  The FMS is an electromagnetic calorimeter covering the pseudo-rapidity region from 2.6 to 4.  It detects collision fragments from neutral pions, eta mesons, jets, single photons and electrons.  The upcoming polarized RHIC run will be emphasizing the transverse proton spin dependence for production of electron-positron Drell-Yan pairs. This will allow measurement of the transverse single spin asymmetry, defined as the difference in cross section for proton spin up or down divided by the sum of those cross sections.

One question the PI hopes to resolve is the following: suppose we only sample from networks where each vertex is incident with at least three edges. How many random edges are needed so that with high probability there is a cycle that goes through each vertex once and only once i.e. a Hamilton cycle. As a typical example of a computational problem consider the following: the edges of a network are given random weights and one wishes to find a minimum weight spanning tree i.e. a set of edges that connects the vertices of the network. Suppose that in addition, the edges have random costs and there is a budget for the tree that cannot be exceeded. The PI provides an algorithm for this problem that with high probability finds a near optimal solution very quickly.

Professor Fleming works with a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students and is leading student retreats focused on work-life balance to ensure that future leaders learn the practices required for high-performing leadership in the chemical industry. <br/><br/>Isocyanides are valuable linchpins for assembling heterocycles and peptidomimetics, which are privileged structures in material and medicinal applications. A major limitation to the implementation of isocyanides for accessing these desirable products is that there are only seven commercially available examples. This research program is working expand these systems by designing new reactions that form more complex examples of these important building blocks and increase the types of bond connections that isocyanides can be used to prepare. Specifically, this project is designing methods for: alkenyl isocyanides to undergo conjugate addition reactions, aryl isocyanides to participate in multicomponent processes to form complex heterocycles, and boroalkylisocyanides to be prepared and used in cross coupling reactions to form more complex isocyanide products. This research program also serves as an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate researchers who are also participating in retreats to hone their work-life balance skills and to prepare for future leadership roles in chemistry careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The film?s ability to provide functionality is tied to its physical structure, or arrangement of molecules. For example, degradation of the film is slower in denser areas. Polymers contain some crystals that are denser than the uncrystallized, or amorphous, regions.  Controlling the amount and location of the crystalline areas is important for preparing the right material for each application. This research aims to develop structure-property relationships based on the crystallization of the polymer in the film. The amount and size of polymer crystalline aggregates will be controlled by preparing films using different solvents and thermal treatments including preparation temperature or melt-cool cycles. In addition, the crystallinity of the film may change over time; therefore, films will be aged at different temperatures to evaluate whether crystalline content increases or decreases. The crystalline aggregates will be analyzed post-production using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to learn how the preparation method influenced the crystal development. Once a better understanding of the crystallization behavior is achieved, the film properties, degradation rate, for example, will be tested to see the effect of the tailored changes in crystallization.   In addition to scientific discovery, major goals of this research include the training of future scientists and engineers as well as promoting STEM education for underrepresented groups. Undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project from lab experiments to public presentation of the results. Performing high-level research helps prepare them for success in graduate school and industrial careers through strong independent thinking and problem solving. Outreach activities will include hosting local high-school students in research and engagement in a K-6 community outreach program that brings students to campus for engineering activities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/><br/>Poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) copolymer films are important crystalline polymers for a number of applications. These copolymers serve as model crystalline-crystalline (CC) diblock copolymers with similar melting temperatures. In these copolymers, the crystallization mechanism is complicated, and final crystallinity can be manipulated using solvent interactions and thermal treatment. The manipulation of the crystal structure creates a new thermodynamically stable state within the film. The metastability can be altered with minor changes in state variables, such as temperature and concentration. Additionally, due to the mobile nature of polymer crystal stems, annealing or aging of the films results in a shift from one metastable state to another. It is important to evaluate and understand these changes in metastability to develop reliable structure-property relationships. In PEO-b-PCL, these metastable states are relatively similar, and the interplay of double crystallinity should result in competition between the most stable state for PEO compared to PCL. The goal of this research is to study the metastability of PEO and PCL crystals when the minority block crystallizes first, how aging affects the metastability of each crystal type, and initial correlations between physical structure and macroscopic transport properties like water uptake, degradation, and small-molecule release as models for e.g. drug delivery. By manipulating the physical structure in new ways, changes in the film?s transport properties may open up new avenues for PEO-b-PCL where these characteristics could be tailored to specific applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader impact of this project is to create a pipeline of such students. By interfacing the REU students with TUteach mentors (pre-service STEM teacher candidates) and summer high school students (who will also be at Temple University during the summer), the project will instill a culture where students at any level can help and inspire other students, and learn how to explain complex topics/problems at a more easily understood level. The students participating in this project will be working on problems that are of fundamental scientific and technological interest, and will advance the state of knowledge in areas such as energy storage and conversion, plasmonics and nanomaterials. Faculty mentors have been selected based on their significant contribution to these fields, as partially measured by their citation impact. <br/><br/>Technical Description: The objectives of the project are to immerse 10 undergraduate students each summer in an exciting and broad range of materials research in areas that will have enormous societal and environmental impacts. The project will interest the students in pursuing careers in areas such as energy storage, nanomaterials and catalysis. The students targeted for recruitment are those from two year undergraduate institutions who will eventually pursue 4 year degrees, but who will otherwise be at a big disadvantage compared with their peers at research universities. The project will aim to show the students that research or teaching in STEM fields is an interesting and rewarding career path for them, and that they can contribute to developing a future with a cleaner environment, and one that minimizes energy consumption. The project will be interdisciplinary, combining faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Engineering. In addition, the project will form cohorts (along with other undergraduate summer students at Temple) of students who will work together on interdisciplinary project that integrate experimental and theory/modeling research. This will not only necessitate the development of communication skills, but is also the way in which many complex problems must be investigated. The activities for the students are designed to (i) give broad overviews of selected topics, e.g. 'Why must batteries be improved?', 'What is an oxygen evolution catalyst?', 'What are molecular simulations?' (via brown bag lunches); (ii) introduce students to the ethics and language of science, i.e. how to write papers and give presentations (via a weekly structured course); (iii) show what information from state-of-the-art instruments can provide (via Temple Materials Institute workshop); (iv) give the students practice and confidence in presenting their own research and also in asking questions to each other and faculty members (via presentations of their research). All activities are timely, as many deal with today's common energy challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This team at Villanova University seeks to bridge the two techniques by incorporating the physics of stellar pulsations into their eclipsing binary star computer code known as PHOEBE.  The project will provide the opportunity to better understand pulsating stars by studying their properties within eclipsing binary systems, and also the other way around, to learn how pulsations influence binarity.  The astronomy group at Villanova has a long tradition of involving undergraduates in their research programs. The project will involve two undergrads per year in this research.  Two community workshops will provide training in the use of PHOEBE for early career scientists, with special consideration given to geographic diversity, gender balance, and representation from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The research team will provide a PHOEBE interface to the virtual reality infrastructure CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) at Villanova, and to off-the-shelf VR headsets. <br/><br/>PHOEBE works on the premise that binary component surfaces can be approximated by a mesh of triangles where each triangle has an assigned set of local quantities (temperature, surface gravity, velocity, emergent intensity, etc). This mesh effectively describes physical circumstances across distorted surfaces and accounts for many effects we see manifested in binary star light curves: gravity brightening due to tidal interaction and rotation, surface brightness variation due to reflection, heating and limb darkening, prominences such as spots, and, through this project, stellar pulsations. Asteroseismologists are able to recover detailed information on stellar properties from the power spectra of the observed light curves, which are in turn used to deduce fundamental parameters of stars by way of the so-called scaling relations. Incorporating stellar pulsations into PHOEBE will provide fundamental stellar parameters of pulsating stars to 1% or better, thus validating asteroseismic scaling relations while providing asteroseismologists with accurate parameters for their models of stellar pulsation mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biology is able to diverge from the inherent limitations of single-component materials by hierarchically organizing multiple components (biopolymers and minerals) with disparate physical properties. The static structure and hierarchical order of biomaterials is only part of the story; biology and living systems create complex materials through nonequilibrium processes. The goal of the CAREER proposal is to investigate nonequilibrium chemical functionalization and self-assembly methods to create multifunctional hybrid polymeric/inorganic materials. Two polymer/nanoparticle material systems will be explored: 1) flexible and electrically conductive co-continuous networks and 2) nanostructured materials exhibiting exceptional strain-stiffening mechanical properties. Establishing and integrating nonequilibrium chemical processes into materials design will potentially lead to new materials with applications in infrastructure, transportation, health care, and information processing. The research aims of the proposal will be integrated into teaching methods by: 1) developing polymer/materials science modules and labs for professors at nondoctorate-granting institutions within Pennsylvania to augment the undergraduate curriculum and 2) creating open-access video-standard operating procedures (VSOP) for all interested researchers to learn detailed methods for polymer synthesis, sample preparation, and characterization.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The hybrid polymer/inorganic materials field has been working under the premise that equilibrium concepts will lead to the complex materials seen in nature, yet biology utilizes nonequilibrium processes to create biomaterials. The overarching aim of the proposal is to identify design criteria using nonequilibrium chemical functionalization and self-assembly methods to create multifunctional hybrid polymeric/inorganic materials via polymerization-induced nanostructural transitions. In this research, in-situ polymer grafting and in-situ block polymer synthetic methods from polymers attached to nanoparticle surfaces will be used to create flexible and electrically conductive co-continuous networks and nanostructured materials exhibiting strain-stiffening properties. The synthetic approach used here will facilitate complex polymer architecture formation in situ and will generate hierarchically ordered materials in which polymer and nanoparticle domains are organized from the nanometer to the micrometer scale. Characterization methods using X-ray and neutron scattering, oscillatory shear dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy during polymerization will reveal the self-assembly mechanism, and lead to fundamental insight for designing hierarchically-ordered materials. Merging in-situ polymerization and structural characterization to investigate structure-property relationships will establish foundational science in nonequilibrium processing that mimics natural systems and harnesses simultaneous property combinations, which are not currently possible in hybrid polymer/inorganic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
